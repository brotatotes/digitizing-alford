This name came to be applied to the writings themselves which contain this news, very early. Justin Martyr, in the second century speaks of “the memoirs drawn up by the Apostles, which are called gospels (euangelia).”<h3><u><b>according to Matthew</b></u></h3> <i>as delivered by</i> Matthew, implies <i>authorship or editorship</i>. It is not merely equivalent to <i>of Matthew</i>, which would have been said, had it been meant. Nor does it signify that the original teaching was Matthew’s and the present gospel drawn up after that teaching. Eusebius tells us, that Matthew “delivered to writing the gospel according to him.”<h1><u><b>CHAP. I. 1–17.</b></u></h1> GENEALOGY OF JESUS CHRIST. <h2><u><b>1.</b> <b>book of the generation</b></u></h2> Not always used of a pedigree only: see reff. Here however it appears that it refers exclusively to the genealogy, by “<i>Jesus Christ</i>” being used in the enunciation, and the close being “<i>Jesus</i> which is called <i>Christ</i>.’ Then ver. 17 forms a conclusion to it, and ver. 18 passes on to other matter. <h3><u><b>Jesus</b></u></h3> See on ver. 21.<h3><u><b>Christ</b></u></h3> The word is equivalent to the Hebrew <i>Messiah</i>, <b>anointed</b>. It is used of kings, priests, prophets, and of the promised Deliverer. It is here used (see ver. 16) in that sense in which it became affixed to Jesus as the name of our Lord. It does not once thus occur in the progress of the Evangelic <i>history</i>; only in the prefatory parts of the Gospels, here and vv. 16, 17, 18: Mark i. 1: John i. 17, and once in the mouth of our Lord Himself, John xvii. 3; but continually in the Acts and Epistles. This may serve to shew that the evangelic memoirs themselves were of earlier date than their incorporation into our present Gospels.<h3><u><b>son ... son</b></u></h3> both times refers to our Lord. <i>Son of David</i> was an especial title of the Messiah: see reff. That He should be <i>son of Abraham</i>, was too solemn a subject of prophecy to be omitted here, even though implied in the other. These words serve to shew the character of the Gospel, as written <i>for Jews</i>. Luke, ch. iii. 23 ff., carries his geneology farther back.<h2><u><b>2. and his brethren</b></u></h2> These additions probably indicate that Matt. did not take his genealogy from any family or public documents, but constructed it himself. <h2><u><b>3.</b></u></h2> These children of Judah were not born in marriage: see Gen. xxxviii. 16–30. Both the sons are named, probably as recalling the incident connected with their birth. The reason for the women (Thamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) being mentioned, has been variously assigned: it might be, to meet the objection of the Jews to <i>our Lord’s</i> birth: or <i>for the sake of minute accuracy</i>.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kAZ62IkvEX4smgOwKAir10L3ArE5bJI/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 69:</a></h3><br>It most probably is, that the Evangelist omitted what was ordinary, but stated what was doubtful or singular. It has been suggested, that as these women are of Gentile origin or dubious character, they may be mentioned as introducing the calling of Gentiles and sinners by our Lord: also, that they may serve as types of the mother of our Lord, and are consequently named in the course of the genealogy, as she is at the end of it.<h2><u><b>5. Rachab</b></u></h2> It has been imagined, on chronological grounds, that this Rachab must be a different person from Rahab of Jericho. But those very grounds completely tally with their identity. For Naashon father of Salmon), prince of Judah (1 Chron. ii. 10), offered his offering at the setting up of the tabernacle (Num. vii. 12) 39 years before the taking of Jericho. So that Salmon would be of mature age at or soon after that event; at which time Rahab was probably young, as her father and mother were living (Josh. vi. 23). Nor is it any objection that Achan, the fourth in descent from Judah by Zara, is contemporary with Salmon, the sixth of the other branch: since the generations in the line of Zara average 69 years, and those in the line of Phares 49, both within the limits of probability. The difficulty of the interval of 366 years between Rahab and David does not to this passage only, but equally to Ruth iv. 21, 22; and is by no means insuperable, especially when the extreme old age of Jesse, implied in 1 Sam. xvii. 12, is considered.—I may add that, considering Rahab’s father and mother were alive, the house would hardly be called <i>the house Of Rahab</i> except on account of the character commonly assigned to her.<h2><u><b>8. Joram ... Ozias</b></u></h2> Three kings, viz. Ahaziah, Joash, Amaziah (1 Chron. iii. 11, 12), are here omitted. Some think that they were erased on account of their connexion, by means of Athaliah, with the accursed house of Ahab. Simeon is omitted by Moses in blessing the tribes (Deut. xxxiii.): the descendants of Zebulun and Dan are over in 1 Chron., and none of the latter tribe are sealed in Rev. vii. But more probably such erasion, even if justifiable by that reason, was not made on account of it, but for convenience, in order to square the numbers of the different portions of the genealogies, as here. Compare, as illustrating such omissions, 1 Chron. viii. 1 with Gen. xlvi. 21.<h2><u><b>11. Josias . . . Jechonias</b></u></h2> Eliakim, son of Josiah and father of Jechonias, is omitted ; which was objected to the Christians by Porphyry. The reading which inserts Joacim (i.e. Eliakim) rests on hardly any foundation, and would make fifteen generations in the second “<i>fourteen.</i>” The solution of the difficulty by supposing the name to apply to both Eliakim and his son, and to mean the former in ver. 11 and the latter in ver. 12, is unsupported by example, and contrary to the usage of the genealogy. When we notice that the <i>brethren </i>of Jechonias are his <i>uncles</i>, and find this way of speaking sanctioned by 2 Chron. xxxvi. 10, where Zedekiah, one of these, is called his brother, we are led to seek our solution in some manner of speaking of these kings, by which Eliakim and his son were not accounted two distinct generations. If we compare 1 Chron. iii. 16 with 2 Kings<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_BKuwTsR2yN9sCJjniNyRbo-tD2B5su-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In the latter passage, where we have “his father’s brother,” the LXX render “his son.” <h2><u><b>12. Jechonias .. .. Salathiel</b></u></h2> So also the genealogy in 1 Chron. iii. 17. When, therefore, it is denounced (Jer. xxii. 30) that Jechoniah should be ‘childless,’ this word must be understood as explained by the rest of the verse, ‘for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.’ <h3><u><b>Salathiel ... Zorobabel</b></u></h3> There is no difficulty here which does not also exist in the O. T. Zerubbabel is there usually called the son of Shealtiel (Salathiel). Ezra iii. 2, &c. Neh. xii. 1, &c. Hag. i.1, &c In 1 Chron. iii, 19, Zerubbabel is said to have been the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel. Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother.<h2><u><b>18. Zorobabel ..... Abiud</b></u></h2> Abiud is not mentioned as a son of the Zerubbabel in 1 Chron. iii—Lord A. Hervey, On the Genealogies of our Lord, p. 122 ff., has made it probable that Abiud is identical with the Hodaiah of 1 Chron. iii. 24, and the Juda of Luke iii. 26–On the comparison of this genealogy with that given in Luke, see notes, Luke iii. 23-38.<h2><u><b>17. fourteen generations</b></u></h2> If we carefully observe Matthew’s arrangement, we shall have no difficulty in completing the three “<i>fourteens</i>.” For the first is from Abraham to David, of course inclusive. The second from David (again inclusive) to the <i>migration</i>; which gives no name, as before, to be included in both the second and third periods, but which is mentioned simultaneously with the begetting of Jechonias, leaving him for the third period. This last, then, takes in from Jechonias to JESUS CHRIST inclusive. So that the three stand thus, according to the words of this verse: (1) from Abraham to David. (2) From David to the migration to Babylon, i.e. about the time when Josiah begat Jechonias. (3) From the migration (i.e. from Jechonias) to Christ.<h2><u><b>18–25.</b></u></h2> CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS BIRTH.<h2><u><b>18. espoused</b></u></h2> i.e. betrothed. The interval between betrothal and the consummation of marriage was sometimes considerable, during which the betrothed remained in her father’s house, till the bridegroom came and fetched her. See Deut. xx. 7 <h3><u><b>came together</b></u></h3> Here to be understood of living together in one house as man and wife. Chrysostom well suggests, that the conception was not allowed to take place before the betrothal, both that the matter might take place more in privacy, and that the Blessed Virgin might escape slanderous suspicion.<h3><u><b>was found</b></u></h3> not merely for <i>was</i>, as some have said, but in its proper meaning:— <b>she was discovered to be</b>, no matter by whom. The words “of (by) the Holy Ghost,” are the addition of the Evangelist declaring the matter of fact, and do not<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jfUI4ricWusHkHMTAL0npHCp00WWaTSo/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Deut. xxii. 24. <h3><u><b>just</b></u></h3><b> “and not willing”</b> is, not the explanation of <b>just</b>, but an additional particular. He was a strict observer of the law,—and (yet) not willing to expose her. The sense of ‘<i>kind</i>,’ ‘<i>merciful</i>,’ proposed by some instead of <b>just</b>, is inadmissible.<h3><u><b>privily</b></u></h3> Not ‘<i>without any writing of divorcement</i>,’ which would have been unlawful; but according to the form prescribed in Deut. xxiv. 1. The husband might either do this, or adopt the stronger course of bringing his wife to justice openly. The punishment in this case would have been death by stoning. Deut. xxii. 23.<h2><u><b>20. behold</b></u></h2> answers to the Hebrew “hinneh,” and is frequently used by Matt. and Luke to introduce a new event or change of scene: not so often by Mark, and never with this view in John.<h3><u><b>an angel</b></u></h3> The announcement was made to Mary openly, but to Joseph in a dream; for in Mary’s case faith and concurrence of will were necessary—the communication was of a higher kind,—and referred to a thing future; but here it is simply an advertisement for caution’s sake of an event which had already happened, and is altogether a communication of an inferior order: see Gen. xx. 3. But see on the other hand the remarks at the close of the notes on ver. 21. <h3><u><b>son of David</b></u></h3> These words would recall Joseph’s mind to the promised seed, the expectation of the families of the lineage of David, and at once stamp the message as the announcement of the birth of the Messiah. May it not likewise be said, that this appellation would come with more force, if Mary also were <i>a daughter</i> of David? The addition, “<b>thy wife</b>,” serves to remind Joseph of that relation which she already held by betrothal, and which he was now exhorted to recognize. See above on ver. 19.<h2><u><b>21. Jesus</b></u></h2> The same name as Joshua, the former deliverer of Israel. Philo says, “Jesus is, being interpreted, ‘The salvation of the Lord.’” <h3><u><b>He</b></u></h3> emphatically: <b>He alone</b>: best rendered, perhaps, ‘<i>it is He that</i>.’ <h3><u><b>his people</b></u></h3> In primary sense, <i>the Jews</i>, of whom alone Joseph could have understood the words: but in the larger sense, all who believe on Him: an explanation which the tenor of prophecy (cf. Gen. xxii. 18: Deut. xxxii. 21), and the subsequent admission of the Gentiles, warrant. Cf. a similar use of ‘Israel’ by St. Peter, Acts v.31. <h3><u><b>from their sins</b></u></h3> It is remarkable that in this early part of the evangelic history, in the midst of pedigrees, and the disturbances of thrones by the supposed temporal King of the Jews, we have so clear an indication of the <i>spiritual nature of the office of Christ</i>. One circumstance of this kind outweighs a thousand cavils against the historical reality of the narration. If I mistake not, this announcement reaches further into the deliverance to be wrought, by Jesus, than any thing mentioned by the Evangelist subsequently. It thus bears the internal impress of a message from God, treasured up and related in its original formal terms.—“Sins” is not put for the <i>punishment of sin</i>, but is the sin itself—<b> the practice of sin</b>, in its most pregnant sense. ‘How suggestive it is,’ remarks Bishop Ellicott, ‘that while to the loftier spirit of Mary the name of Jesus is revealed with all the prophetic associations of more than David’s glories—to Joseph, perchance the aged Joseph, who might have long seen and realized his own spiritual needs, and the needs of those around him, it is specially said, thou shalt call his name Jesus: <i>for He shall save his people from their sins.</i>’ Historical Lectures on the Life of our Lord, p. 56. <h2><u><b>22. that it might be fulfilled</b></u></h2> It is impossible to interpret that in any other sense than<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G3Cig3vXSNbHnBACrQ6-d1VuSRPw6a3j/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Nor, if rightly viewed, does the passage require any other. Whatever may have been the partial fulfilment of the prophecy in the time of Ahaz, its reference to a different time, and a higher deliverance, is undeniable: and then, whatever causes contributed to bring about all this, might be all summed up in the fulfilment of the divine purpose, of which that prophecy was the declaration. The accomplishment of a promise formally made is often alleged as the cause of an action extending wider than the promise, and purposed long before its utterance. And of course these remarks apply to every passage where the phrase is used. Such a construction can have but one meaning. If such meaning involve us in difficulty regarding the prophecy itself, far better leave such difficulty, in so doubtful a matter as the interpretation of prophecy, unsolved, than create one in so simple a matter as the rendering of a phrase whose meaning no indifferent person could doubt. The immediate and literal fulfilment of the prophecy seems to be related in Isa. viii. 1–4. Yet there the child was <i>not </i>called Emmanuel: but in ver. 8 that name is used as applying to one of far greater dignity. Again, Isa. ix. 6 seems to be a reference to this prophecy, as also Micah v. 3.<h2><u><b>23. the virgin</b></u></h2> the words are from the Septuagint. Such is the rendering of the LXX. The Hebrew word is the more general term, “<i>the young woman</i>,” and is so translated by Aquila. <h3><u><b>they shall call</b></u></h3> This indefinite plural is surely not without meaning here. <b>Men shall call</b>—i.e. it shall be a name by which He shall be called —one of his appellations. The change of person seems to shew, both that the prophecy had a literal fulfilment at the time, and that it is here quoted in a form suited to its greater and final fulfilment. The<br><br>Hebrew has, ‘<i>thou shalt call</i>’ (fem.).<h3><u><b>Emmanuel</b></u></h3> i.e. <b>God (is) with us</b>. In Isaiah, prophetic primarily of deliverance from the then impending war; but also of final and glorious deliverance by the manifestation of God in the flesh.<h2><u><b>25.</b></u></h2> With regard to the much-controverted sense of this verse we may observe, (1) That the primâ facie impression on the reader certainly is, that <b>knew her not</b> was confined to the period of time here mentioned. (2) That there is nothing in Scripture tending to remove this impression, either (a) by narration,—and the very use of the term, “<i>brethren of the Lord</i>” (on which see note at ch. xiii. 55), without qualification, shews that the idea was not repulsive: or (b) by implication,—for every where in the N. T. marriage is spoken of in high and honourable terms; and the words of the angel to Joseph rather imply, than discountenance, such a supposition. (3) On the other hand, the words of this verse do not <i>require </i>it: the idiom being justified on the contrary hypothesis. See my Greek Test. On the whole it seems to me, that <i>no one would ever have thought of interpreting the verse any otherwise than in its primâ facie meaning, except to force it into accordance with a preconceived notion of the perpetual virginity of Mary</i>. It is characteristic, and historically instructive, that the great impugner of the view given above should be Jerome, the impugner of marriage itself: and that his opponents in its interpretation should have been branded as heretics by after ages.

Another name for our Bethlehem was Ephrath; Gen. xxxv. 19; xlviii. 7; or Ephrata, Micah v. 2. It was six Roman miles to the south of Jerusalem, and was known as ‘the city of David,’ the origin of his family, Ruth i. 1, 19.<h3><u><b>in the days of Herod</b></u></h3> HEROD THE GREAT, son of Antipater, an Idumæan, by an Arabian mother, made king of Judæa on occasion of his having fled to Rome, being driven from his tetrarchy by the pretender Antigonus. This title was confirmed to him after the battle of Actium by Octavianus. He sought to strengthen his throne by a series of cruelties and slaughters, putting to death even his wife Mariamne, and his sons Alexander and Aristobulus. His cruelties, and his affectation of Gentile customs, gained for him a hatred among the Jews, which neither his magnificent rebuilding of the temple, nor his liberality in other public works, nor his provident care of the people during a severe famine, could mitigate. He died miserably, five days after he had put to death his son Antipater, in the seventieth year of his age, the thirty-eighth of his reign, and the 750th year of Rome. The events here related took place a short time before his death, but necessarily more than forty days; for he spent the last forty days of his life at Jericho and the baths of Callirrhoe, and therefore would not be found by the magi at Jerusalem. The history of Herod’s reign is contained in Josephus, Antt. books xiv. — xvii.<br><br>It would be useless to detail all the conjectures to which this history has given rise. From what has been written on the subject it would appear, (1) That <b>the East</b> may mean either <i>Arabia, Persia,</i> <i>Chald</i>æ<i>a, or Parthia, with the provinces adjacent</i>. See Judges vi. 3: Isa. xli. 2; xlvi. 11: Num. xxiii. 7. Philo speaks of “the Eastern nations and their leaders the Parthians.” In all these countries there were <b>magi</b>, at least persons who in the wider sense of the word were now known by the name. The words in ver. 2 seem to point to some land not very near Judæa, as also the result of Herod’s enquiry as to the date, shewn in “two years old.” (2) If we place together (<i>a</i>) the prophecy in Num. xxiv. 17, which could hardly be unknown to the Eastern astrologers, —and (<i>b</i>) the assertion of Suetonius “that there prevailed an ancient and consistent opinion in all the East, that it was fated that at that time those should go forth from Judæa who should rule the empire:”—and of Tacitus, to the same effect and nearly in the same words,—and (<i>c</i>) the prophecy, also likely to be known in the East, of the seventy weeks in Daniel ix. 24;—we can, I think, be at no loss to understand how any remarkable celestial appearance at this time should have been interpreted as it was. (3) There is no ground for supposing the magi to have been <i>three</i> in number (as first, apparently, by Leo the Great, A.D. 450); or to have been <i>kings</i>. The <i>first</i> tradition appears to have arisen from the number of their gifts: the <i>second</i>, from the prophecy in Isa. lx. 3. Tertullian seems to deduce it from the similar prophecy in Ps. lxxii. 10, for, he says, the Magi were most commonly kings in the East.<h2><u><b>2. his star</b></u></h2> There is a question, whether this expression of the magi, <b>we have seen his star</b>, <i>points to any miraculous appearance</i>, or to something observed in the course of their watching the heavens. <i>We know the magi to have been devoted to astrology</i>: and on comparing the language of our text with this undoubted fact, I confess that it appears to me the most ingenuous way, fairly to take account of that fact in our exegesis, and <i>not to shelter ourselves from an apparent difficulty by the hypothesis of a miracle</i>. Wherever supernatural agency is asserted, or may be reasonably inferred, I shall ever be found foremost to insist on its recognition, and impugn every device of rationalism or semi-rationalism; but it does not therefore follow that I should consent to attempts, however well meant, <i>to introduce miraculous interference where it does not appear to be borne out by the narrative</i>. The principle on which this commentary is conducted, is that of <i>honestly endeavouring to ascertain the sense of the sacred text, without regard to any preconceived systems, and fearless of any possible consequences</i>. And if the scientific or historical researches of others seem to contribute to this, my readers will find them, as far as they have fallen within my observation, made use of for that purpose. It seems to me that the preliminary question for us is, Have we here in the sacred text a miracle, or have we some natural appearancé which God in His Providence used as a means of indicating to the magi the birth of His Son?<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdaTQfzJbp7I2BEuFyW_uMla010HBJh3/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 74:</a></h3><br>Different minds may feel differently as to the answer to this question. And, seeing that much has been said and written on this note in no friendly spirit, I submit that it is not for any man to charge another, who is as firm a believer in the facts related in the sacred text as he himself can be, with weakening that belief, because he feels an honest conviction that it is here relating, not a miracle, but a natural appearance. It is, of course, the far <i>safer</i> way, as far as reputation is concerned, to introduce miraculous agency wherever possible: but the present Editor aims at truth, not popularity.<br><br>Now we learn from astronomical calculations, that a remarkable conjunction of the planets of our system took place a short time before the birth of our Lord. In the year of Rome 747, on the 29th of May, there was a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the 20th degree of the constellation Pisces, close to the first point of Aries, which was the part of the heavens noted in astrological science as that in which the signs denoted the greatest and most noble events. On the 29th of September, in the same year, another conjunction of the same planets took place, in the 16th of Pisces: and on the 5th of December, a third, in the 15th degree of the same sign. Supposing the magi to have seen the <i>first</i> of these conjunctions, they saw it actually <b>in the East</b>; for on the 29th of May <i>it would rise</i> 3½ hours before sunrise. If they then took their journey, and arrived at Jerusalem in 2 little more than <i>five</i> months (the journey from Babylon took Ezra <i>four</i> months, see Ezra vii. 9), if they performed the route from Jerusalem to Bethlehem in the evening, as is implied, the <i>December conjunction</i>, in 15° of Pisces, would be before them <i>in the direction of Bethlehem</i>, 1½ hour east of the meridian at sunset. These circumstances would seem to form a remarkable coincidence with the history in our text. are in no way inconsistent with the word <b>star</b>, which cannot surely (see below) be pressed to its mere literal sense of one single star, but understood in its wider astrological meaning: nor is this explanation of <i>the star directing them to Bethlehem</i> at all repugnant to the plain words of vv. 9, 10, importing its motion from S.E. towards S.W., the direction of Bethlehem. We may further observe, that <i>no part of the text respecting the star, asserts, or even implies, a miracle</i>; and that the very slight apparent inconsistencies with the above explanation are no more than the <i>report of the magi</i> themselves, and the <i>general belief of the age</i> would render unavoidable. If this <i>subservience of the superstitions of astrology to the Divine purposes</i> be objected to, we may answer with Wetstein, “We must infer therefore that these men came to their conclusion from the rules of their art: which though beyond all doubt futile, vain, and delusive, might yet be sometimes permitted to hit on a right result. Hence appears the wonderful wisdom of God, who used the wickedness of men to bring Joseph into Egypt,—who sent the King of Babylon against the Jews by auguries and divinations (Ezek. xxi. 21, 22), and in this instance directed the magi to Christ by astrology.”<br><br>It may be remarked that Abarbanel the Jew, who knew nothing of <i>this</i> conjunction, relates it as a tradition, that no conjunction could be of mightier import than that of Jupiter and Saturn, which planets were in conjunction A.M. 2365, before the birth of Moses, in the sign of Pisces; and thence remarks that that sign was the most significant one for <i>the Jews</i>. From this consideration he concludes that the conjunction of these planets in that sign, in his own time (A.D. 1463), betokened the near approach of the birth of the Messiah. And as the Jews did not invent astrology, but learnt it from the Chaldæans, this idea, that a conjunction in Pisces betokened some great event in Judæa, must have prevailed among Chaldæan astrologers.<br><br>It is fair to notice the influence on the position maintained in this note of the fact which seems to have been substantiated, that the planets did not, during the year B.C. 7, approach each other so as to be mistaken by any eye for one star: indeed not “within double the apparent diameter of the moon.” I submit, that even if this were so, the inference in the note remains as it was. The <i>conjunction of the two planets</i>, complete or incomplete, would be that which would bear astrological significance, not their looking like one star. The two bright planets seen in the east,—the two bright planets standing over Bethlehem,—these would on each occasion have arrested the attention of the magi; and this appearance would have been denominated by them <b>his star</b>.<h3><u><b>in the east</b></u></h3> i.e. either in the <i>Eastern country from which they came, </i>or in the<i> Eastern quarter of the heavens.</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6ZRrS0C0NqXnJl0aMHw4M19CFVzBFD6/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The tribes were divided into thousands, and the names of the thousands inscribed in the public records of their respective cities. In Judges vi. 15 Gideon says “Behold my thousand is weak in Manasseh” (see English version, margin), on which Rabbi Kimchi annotates, “Some understand Alphi to mean ‘my father,’ as if it were Alluph, whose signification is ‘prince or lord.’” And thus, it appears, did the Sanhedrim understand the word (which is the same) in Micah v. 2. The word, without points, may mean either “<i>among the thousands,</i>” or “<i>among the princes.</i>”<h3><u><b>out of thee shall come</b></u></h3> It has been remarked that the singular expression, which occurs both in Tacitus and Suetonius (see above), “<i>there should go forth from Judea,</i>” may have been derived from these words of the LXX.<h2><u><b>9.</b></u></h2><b> stood over</b> may mean ‘<i>over that part of Bethlehem where the young child was,</i>’ which they might have ascertained by enquiry. Or it may even mean, ‘<i>over the whole town of Bethlehem.’</i> If it is to be understood as standing <i>over the house</i>, and thus <i>indicating </i>to the magi the <i>position of the object of their search</i>, the whole incident must be regarded as miraculous, But this<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O--lanXVDcoufS8MmtVELN1cwkBI8Nv4/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In the parallel account as regarded the shepherds, in Luke ii. 16, he is mentioned. I would rather regard the omission here as indicating a <i>simple matter of fact</i>, and contributing to shew the truthfulness of the narrative:—that Joseph <i>happened not to be present</i> at the time. If the meaning of <i>the house</i> is to be pressed (as in a matter of detail I think it should), it will confirm the idea that Joseph and Mary, probably under the idea that the child was to be brought up at Bethlehem, <i>dwelt there some time</i> after the Nativity. Epiphanius, supposes that Mary was at this time on a visit to her Kindred at Bethlehem (possibly at a Passover) as much as two years after our Lord’s birth. But if Mary had kindred at Bethlehem, how could she be so ill-provided with lodging, and have (as is implied in Luke ii. 7) sought accommodation at an inn? And the supposition of two years having elapsed, derived probably from the “<i>two years old</i>” of ver. 16, will involve us in considerable difficulty. There seems to be no reason why the magi may not have come within the forty days before the Purification, which itself may have taken place in the interval between their departure and Herod’s discovery that they had mocked him. No objection can be raised to this view from the “two years old” of ver. 16: see note there. The general idea is, that the Purification was <i>previous </i>to the visit of the magi. Being persuaded of the historic reality of these narratives of Matt. and Luke, we shall find no difficulty in also believing that, <i>were we acquainted with all the events as they happened, their reconcilement would be an easy matter</i> ; whereas now the two independent accounts, from not being aware of, seem to exclude one another. This will often be the case in ordinary life; e.g. in the giving of evidence. And nothing can more satisfactorily shew the veracity and independence of the narrators, where their testimony to the main facts, as in the t case, is consentient.<h3><u><b>treasures</b></u></h3> <i>chests </i>or <i>bales</i>, in which the gifts were carried during their journey. The ancient Fathers were fond of tracing in the gifts symbolical meanings: “as to the king, the gold: as to one who was to die, the myrrh: as to a god, the frankincense.” Origen, against Celsus; and similarly Irenæus. We cannot conclude from these gifts that the magi came from <i>Arabia</i>,—as they were common to all the East. Strabo says that the best frankincense comes from the borders of Persia.<h2><u><b>13–23.</b></u></h2> FLIGHT INTO EGYPT.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDO9cK5k-bwdse12-FVA9_NLgunseSqg/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

He must be understood, on account of “<i>by night</i>” below, as having arisen the same night and departed forthwith. Egypt, as <i>near</i>, as <i>a Roman province and independent of Herod</i>, and <i>much inhabited by Jews</i>, was an easy and convenient refuge.<h2><u><b>15. Out of Egypt</b></u></h2> This citation shews the almost universal application in the N.T. of the prophetic writings to the expected Messiah, as the general antitype of all the events of the typical dispensation. We shall have occasion to remark the same again and again in the course of the Gospels. It seems to have been a received axiom of interpretation (which has, by its adoption in the N. T., received the sanction of the Holy Spirit Himself, and now stands for our guidance), that the subject of all allusions, the represented in all parables and dark sayings, was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent and reign.—The words are written in Hosea <i>of the children of Israel</i>, and are rendered from the Hebrew. —A similar expression with regard to Israel is found in Exod. iv. 22, 23.<br><br><b>that it might be fulfilled</b> must not be ex- plained away: it never denotes the event or mere result, but always the <i>purpose</i>.<h2><u><b>16.</b></u></h2> Josephus makes no mention of this slaughter; nor is it likely that he would have done. Probably no great number of children perished in so small a place as Bethlehem and its neighbourhood. The modern objections to this narrative may be answered best by remembering the monstrous character of this tyrant, of whom Josephus asserts, “a dark choler seized on him, maddening him against all.’ Herod had marked the way to his throne, and his reign itself, with blood; had murdered his wife and three sons (the last just about this time); and was likely enough, in blind fury, to have made no enquiries, but given the savage order at once.—Besides, there might have been a reason for not making enquiry, but rather taking the course he did, which was sure, as he thought, to answer the end, without divulging the purpose. The word “<i>privily</i>” in ver. 7 seems to favour this view.<h3><u><b>was mocked</b></u></h3> The Evangelist is speaking of Herod’s view of the matter.<h3><u><b>the borders thereof</b></u></h3> The word <i>coasts </i>is the common rendering of the Greek <i>horia</i> in the A.V. It does not imply any bordering on a sea shore, but is an old use for <i>parts, or neighbourhood</i>, as côte in French. See margin of A.V.<br><br><b>the borders thereof</b> will betoken the insulated houses, and hamlets, which belonged to the territory of Bethlehem.<h3><u><b>from two years old</b></u></h3> This expression must not be taken as any very certain indication of the time when the star did actually appear. The addition <b>and under</b> implies that there was uncertainty in Herod’s mind as to the age pointed out; and if so, why might not the jealous tyrant, although he had accurately ascertained the date of the star’s appearing, have taken a range of time extending before as well as after it, the more surely to attain his point?<h2><u><b>17. that which was spoken by Jeremy</b></u></h2> Apparently, an accommodation of the prophecy in Jer. xxxi. 15, which was originally written of the Babylonish captivity. We must not draw any fanciful distinction between “<b>then was fulfilled</b>” and “that might be fulfilled,” but rather seek our explanation in the acknowledged system of prophetic interpretation among the Jews, still extant in their rabbinical books, and now sanctioned to us by N.T. usage; at the same time remembering, for our caution, how little even now we understand of the full bearing of prophetic and typical words and acts. None of the expressions of this prophecy must be closely and literally pressed. The link of connexion seems to be <i>Rachel's sepulchre</i>, which (Gen. xxxv. 19: see also<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2f_IJ_JGZO_2kdKgwwB0o8hNs2k5_or/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

We must also take into account the close relation between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which had long subsisted. Ramah was six miles to the <i>north </i>of Jerusalem, in the tribe of Benjamin (Jer. xl. 1: “Er-Ram, marked by the village and green patch on its summit, the most conspicuous object from a distance in the approach to Jerusalem from the South, is certainly ‘Ramah of Benjamin.’” Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 213; so that neither must this part of the prophecy be strictly taken.<h2><u><b>20. for they are dead</b></u></h2> The plural here is not merely idiomatic, nor for lenity and forbearance, in speaking of the dead; but perhaps a citation from Exod. iv. 19, where the same words are spoken to Moses, or betokens, not the number, but the category. Herod the Great died of a dreadful disease at Jericho, in the seventieth year of his age, and the thirty-eighth of his reign, A.U.C. 750.<h2><u><b>22.</b></u></h2> ARCHELAUS was the son of Herod by Malthace, a Samaritan woman: he was brought up at Rome; succeeded his father, but never had the title of king, only that of Ethnarch, with the government of Idumæa, Judæa, and Samaria, the rest of his father’s dominions being divided between his brothers Philip and Antipas. But, (1) very likely the word <i>reign </i>is here used in the wider meaning :—(2) Archelaus did, in the beginning of his reign, give out and regard himself as king: (3) in ch. xiv. 9, Herod the Tetrarch is called <i>the King</i>.— In the ninth year of his government Archelaus was dethroned, for having governed cruelly the Jews and Samaritans, who sent an embassy to Rome against him, and he was banished to Vienne, in Gaul. This account gives rise to some difficulty as compared with St. Luke’s history. It would certainly, on a first view, appear that this Evangelist was not aware that Nazareth had been before this the abode of Joseph and Mary. And it is no real objection to this, that he elsewhere calls Nazareth “<i>His country,</i>” ch. xiii. 54,57. It is perhaps just possible that St. Matthew, writing for Jews, although well aware of the previous circumstances, may not have given them a place in his history, but made the birth at Bethlehem the prominent point, seeing that his account begins at the birth (ch. i. 18), and does not localize what took place before it, which is merely inserted as subservient to that great leading event. If this view be correct, all we could expect is, that his narrative would contain <i>nothing inconsistent</i> with the facts related in Luke; which we find to be the case.—I should prefer, however, believing, as more consistent with the fair and conscientious interpretation of our text, that St. Matthew himself was not aware of the events related in Luke i. ii., and wrote under the impression that Bethlehem was the original dwelling-place of Joseph and Mary. Certainly, <i>had we only his Gospel</i>, this inference from it would universally be made.<br><br><b>turned aside</b> must not be pressed into the service of reconciling the two accounts by being rendered ‘<i>returned;</i>’ for the same is used (ver. 14) of the journey to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGGbVkzCubRLGnaO6VWn5ULiG-z9GAFX/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In searching for such sense, the following hypotheses have been made—none of them satisfactory:— (1) Euthymius says, “Do not enquire what prophets said this: for you will not find out: because many of the prophetic books have perished, some in the captivities, some by neglect of the Jews, some also by foul play.” So also Chrysostom and others. Bar the expression “<i>by the prophets</i>” seems to have a wider bearing than is thus implied. (2) Others say, the general sense of the prophets is, that Christ should be a <i>despised person, as the inhabitants of Nazareth were</i> (John i. 47). But surely this part of the Messiah’s prophetic character is not general or prominent enough, in the absence of any direct verbal connexion with the word in our text, to found such an interpretation on: nor, on the other hand, does it appear that an inhabitant of Nazareth, as such, was despised; only that the obscurity of the town was, both by Nathanael and the Jews, contrasted with our Lord’s claims. (3) The <i>Nazarites </i>of old were men holy and consecrated to God; e.g. Samson (Judg. xiii. 5), Samuel (1 Sam. i. 11), and to this the words are referred by Tertullian, Jerome, and others. But (<i>a</i>) our Lord did not (like John the Baptist) lead a life in accordance with the Nazarite vow, but drank wine, &c., and set himself in marked contrast with John in this very particular (ch. xi. 18, 19); and (b) the word here is not <i>Nazarite</i>, but <i>Nazarene</i>, denoting an inhabitant of Nazareth. (4) There may be an allusion to the Hebrew “<i>Netser,</i>” a branch, by which name our Lord is called in Isa. xi. 1, and from which word it appears that the name Nazareth is probably derived. So “<i>learned Hebrews</i>” mentioned by Jerome on Isa. xi. 1, and others. But this word is only used in the place cited; and in by far the more precise prophecies of the Branch, Zech. iii. 8; vi. 12: Jer. xxiii. 5; xxxiii. 15, and Isa. iv. 2, the word “<i>Tsemach</i>” is used.—I leave it, therefore, as an unsolved difficulty.<h1><u><b>CHAP. III. 1—12.</b></u></h1> PREACHING AND BAPTISM OF JOHN. Mark i. 1–8: Luke iii. 1–17 (John i. 6–28). Here the <i>synoptic narrative</i> (i.e. the narrative common to the three Evangelists) begins, its extent being the same as that specified by Peter in Acts i. 22, ‘<i>from the baptism of John unto that same day that He was taken up from us.</i>’ For a comparison of the narratives in the various sections, see notes on St. Mark. In <i>this </i>Gospel, I have generally confined myself to the <i>subject-matter</i>.<h2><u><b>1. In those days</b></u></h2> The last matter mentioned was the dwelling at Nazareth; and though we must not take the connexion strictly as implying that <i>Joseph </i>dwelt there all the intermediate thirty years, “<i>those days</i>” must be understood to mean that we take up the persons of the narrative where we left them; i.e. dwelling at Nazareth.<h3><u><b>came</b></u></h3> literally, <b>comes forward—</b>‘makes his appearance.’ Euthymius asks the question, <i>whence?</i> and answers it, <i>from the recesses of the wilderness</i>. But this can hardly be, owing to the “<i>in the wilderness</i>” following. The verb is used absolutely. The title “John <i>the Baptist</i>” shews that St. Matthew was writing for those who well knew John the Baptist as an historical personage. Josephus, in mentioning him, calls him “<i>John who is called the Baptist.</i>” John was strictly speaking a <i>prophet</i>; belonging to the legal dispensation; a rebuker of sin, and preacher of repentance. The expression in St. Luke, “<i>the word of God came to John,</i>” is the usual formula for the divine commission of the Prophets (Jer. i. 1: Ezek. vi.1; vii. 1, &c.). And the effect of the Holy Spirit on John was more in accordance with the O.T. than the N.T. inspiration; more of a sudden overpowering influence, as in the Prophets, than a gentle indwelling manifested through the individual character, as in the Apostles and Evangelists.—The baptism of John was of a deeper significance than that usual among the Jews in the case of proselytes, and formed an integral part of his divinely appointed office. It was emphatically the baptism of <i>repentance </i>(Luke iii. 3), but not that of <i>regeneration </i>(Titus iii. 5).<br><br>We find in Acts xviii. 24–26; xix. 1–7, accounts of persons who had received the baptism of John, who believed, and (in Apollos’s case) taught accurately the things (i.e. facts concerning the Lord; but required instruction (in doctrine), and rebaptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus. Whether the baptism practised by the disciples before the Resurrection was of the same kind, and required this renewal, is uncertain. The fact of our Lord Himself having received baptism from John, is decisive against the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w8hmSlu9BwQCcwfTv0ESbr24JZtcgMQ2/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This tract was not strictly a <i>desert</i>, but thinly peopled, and abounding in pastures for flocks. This <i>wilderness </i>answers to “<i>all the country round about Jordan</i>” in Luke iii. 3. See note on ch. iv. 1.<h2><u><b>2. Repent</b></u></h2> Used by the Baptist in the O.T. sense of <i>turning to God as His people</i>, from the spiritual idolatry and typical adultery in which the faithless among the Jews were involved. This, of course, included personal amendment in individuals. See Luke iii. 10–14. Josephus describes John as “‘commanding the Jews to practise virtue, and justice to their neighbour, and piety towards God, and thus to receive his baptism.”<h3><u><b>the kingdom of heaven</b></u></h3> An expression peculiar in the N.T. to St. Matthew. The more usual one is “<i>the Kingdom of God:</i>” but “<i>the Kingdom of heaven</i>” is common in the Rabbinical writers, who do not however, except in one or two places, mean by it <i>the reign of the Messiah</i>, but <i>the Jewish religion—the theocracy</i>. Still, from the use of it by St. Matthew here, and in ch. iv. 17, x. 7, we may conclude that it was used by the Jews, and understood, to mean <i>the advent the Christ</i>, probably from the prophecy in Dan. ii. 44; vii. 13, 14, 27.<h2><u><b>3. For this is he</b></u></h2> <i>Not the words of the Baptist</i>, meaning “<i>for I am he,</i>” as in John i. 23, but <i>of the Evangelist</i>; and “<i>is</i>” is not for “<i>was,</i>” but is the prophetic present, representing to us the place which the Baptist fills in the divine purposes, Of <b>for</b>, Bengel says well, that it gives tho cause why John then came forward, as described in ver. 1, 2, viz. because it had been thus predicted. —The primary and literal application of this prophecy to <i>the return from captivity</i> is very doubtful. If it <i>ever had</i> such an application, we may safely say that its predictions were so imperfectly and sparingly fulfilled in that return, or any thing which followed it, that we are necessarily directed onward to its greater fulfilment—the announcement of the kingdom of Christ. Euthymius remarks, that the ways and paths of the Lord are men’s souls, which must be cleared of the thorns of passion and the stones of sin, and thus made straight and level for His approach.<h2><u><b>4. And the same John</b></u></h2> rather, <b>now John himself</b>, recalling the reader from the prophetic testimony, to the person of John. As John was the Elias of prophecy, so we find in his outward attire a striking similarity to Elias, who was “<i>an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.</i>” 2 Kings i. 8. The garment of camel’s hair was not the camel’s skin with the hair on, which would be too heavy to wear, but raiment woven of camel’s hair. From Zech. xiii. 4, it seems that such a dress was known as the prophetic garb: ‘neither shall they (the prophets) wear a rough garment to deceive.’<h3><u><b>locusts</b></u></h3> There is no difficulty here. The locust, permitted to be eaten, Levit. xi. 22, was used as food by the lower orders in Judea, and mentioned by Strabo and Pliny as eaten by the Æthiopians, and by many other authors, as articles of food. Jerome mentions it as the custom in the East and Libya: and Shaw found locusts eaten by the Moors in Barbary. (Travels, p. 164.)<h3><u><b>wild honey</b></u></h3> See 1 Sam. xiv. 25. Here again there is no need to suppose any thing else meant but honey made by wild bees. Schulz found such honey in wilderness in our own time. See Psalm lxxxi. 16: Judg. xiv. 8: Deut. xxxii.13.<h2><u><b>5.</b></u></h2><b> all the region round about Jordan</b> means all the neighbourhood of<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTqBUm0mLRHiKEGBPvPFRlON0h58A-bq/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Parts of Peræa, Samaria, Galilee, and Gaulonitis come under this denomination.—There need be no surprise at such multitudes going out to John. The nature of his announcement, coupled with the prevalent expectation of the time, was enough to produce this effect. See, as strictly consistent with this account, chap. xi. 7—15.<h2><u><b>6. were baptized</b></u></h2> When <i>men </i>were admitted as proselytes, three rites were performed— <i>circumcision, baptism, </i>and <i>oblation</i>; when <i>women</i>, two—<i>baptism </i>and <i>oblation</i>. The baptism was administered in the day-time, by immersion of the whole person; and while standing in the water the proselyte was instructed in certain portions of the law. The whole families of proselytes, including infants, were baptized. It is most probable that John’s baptism in outward form resembled that of proselytes. See above, on ver. 1. Some deny that the proselyte baptism was in use before the time of John: but the contrary has been generally supposed, and maintained. Indeed the baptism or lustration of a proselyte on admission would follow, as a matter of course, by analogy from the constant legal practice of lustration after all uncleannesses: and it is difficult to imagine a time when it would not be in use. Besides, it is highly improbable that the Jews should have borrowed the rite from the Christians, or the Jewish hierarchy from John.<h3><u><b>confessing their sins</b></u></h3> From the form and expression, this does not seem to have been merely ‘shewing a contrite spirit,’ ‘confessing themselves sinners,’ but <i>a particular and individual confession</i>; not, however, made privately to John, but before the people: see his exhortation to the various classes in Luke iii. 10–15: nor in every case, but in those which required it.<h2><u><b>7. Pharisees and Sadducees</b></u></h2> These two sects, according to Josephus, Antt. xiii. 5. 9, originated at the same period, under Jonathan the High Priest (B.C. 159–144). The PHARISEES, deriving their name probably from “<i>Parash,</i>” ‘he separated,’ took for their distinctive practice the strict observance of the law and all its requirements, written and oral. They had great power over the people, and are numbered by Josephus, as being, about the time of the death of Herod the Great, above 6000. We find in the Gospels the Pharisees the most constant opponents of our Lord, and His discourses frequently directed against them. The character of the sect as a whole was <i>hypocrisy</i>; the outside acknowledgment and honouring of God and his law, but inward and practical denial of Him; which rendered them the enemies of the simplicity and genuineness which characterized our Lord’s teaching. Still, among them were undoubtedly pious and worthy men, honourably distinguished from the mass of the sect; John iii.1: Actsv.34, The various points of their religious and moral belief will be treated of as they occur in the text of the Gospels.<br><br>The SADDUCEES are <i>said </i>to have derived their name from one Sadok, about the time of Alexander the Great (B.C. 323): but they were named from the Hebrew <i>Tsaddik, righteousness</i>, more probably. They <i>rejected all tradition</i>, but did not, as some have supposed, confine their canon of Scripture to the Pentateuch. The denial of a future state does not appear to have been an original tenet of Sadduceism, but to have sprung from its abuse. The particular side of religionism represented by the Sadducees was bare literal moral conformity, without any higher views or hopes. They thus escaped the dangers of tradition, but fell into deadness and worldliness, and a denial of spiritual influence. While our Lord was on earth, this state of mind was very prevalent among the educated classes throughout the Roman empire; and most of the Jews of rank and station were Sadducees. —The two sects, mutually hostile, are found frequently in the Gospels united in opposition to our Lord (see ch. xvi. 1, 6, 11; xxii. 23, 34; also Acts iv. 1); the Pharisees representing hypocritical superstition; the Sadducees, carnal unbelief.<h3><u><b>come</b></u></h3> It would appear here as if these Pharisees and Sadducees came with others, and because others did, without any worthy motive, and they were probably deterred by his rebuke from undergoing baptism at his hands. We know, from Luke vii. 30, that the Pharisees in general ‘<i>were not baptized of him.</i>’<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rl5i5G9Rsu3XxvKzPE5SQnFuJAn95zS9/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It was the general expectation of the Jews that troublous times would accompany the appearance of the Messiah. John is now speaking in the true character of a prophet, foretelling the wrath soon to be poured on the Jewish nation.<h2><u><b>8.</b></u></h2><b> therefore</b> expresses an inference from their apparent intention of fleeing from the wrath to come: q.d. ‘if you are really so minded,’. . .<h2><u><b>9. think not to say</b></u></h2> Not merely equivalent to “<i>say not</i>:” but, <b>Do not fancy you may say</b>, &c. The expression <b>to say within yourselves</b>, as similar expressions in Scripture (e.g. Ps. x. 6, 11; xiv.1: Eccl. i. 16; ii. 15, al. fr.), is used to signify the act by which outward circumstances are turned into thoughts of the mind.<h3><u><b>of these stones</b></u></h3> The pebbles or shingle on the beach of the Jordan. He possibly referred to Isa. li. 1, 2. This also is prophetic, of the admission of the Gentile church. See Rom. iv. 16: Gal iii. 29. Or we may take the interpretation which Chrysostom prefers, also referring to Isa. li. 1, 2: <i>Think not that your perishing will leave Abraham without children: for God is able to raise him up children even from stones, as He created man out of dust at the beginning,</i> The <i>present </i>tenses, “<i>is laid,</i>” “<i>is cut down,</i>” imply the law, or habit, which now and henceforward, in the kingdom of heaven prevails: ‘<i>from this time it is so.</i>’<br><br><b>ll. whose shoes,</b> &c.) Lightfoot shews that it was the token of a slave having become his master’s property, to <i>loose </i>his shoe, to <i>tie </i>the same, or to <i>carry</i> the necessary articles for him to the bath. The expressions therefore in all the Gospels amount to the same.<h3><u><b>with the Holy Ghost, and with fire</b></u></h3> This was literally falfilled at the day of Pentecost: but Origen and others refer the words to the baptism of the <i>righteous by the Holy Spirit</i>, and <i>of the wicked by fire</i>. I have no doubt that this this is a mistake in the present case, though apparently (to the superficial reader) borne out by ver. 12. The <i>double </i>symbolic reference of fire, elsewhere found, e.g. Mark ix. 50, as purifying the good and consuming the evil, though <i>illustrated </i>by these verses, is hardly to be pressed into the interpretation of <i>fire </i>in this verse, the prophecy <i>here </i>being solely of that higher and more perfect baptism to which that of John was a mere introduction. To separate off “<i>with the Holy Ghost</i>” as belonging to one set of persons, and “<i>with fire</i>” as belonging to another, when both are united in “<i>you,</i>” is in the last degree harsh, besides introducing confusion into the whole. The members of comparison in this verse are <i>strictly parallel</i> to one another: the <i>baptism by water</i>, the end of which is “<i>repentance,</i>” a mere transition state, a note of preparation,—and the <i>baptism by the Holy Ghost and fire</i>, the end of which is (ver. 12) <i>sanctification</i>, the entire aim and purpose of man’s creation and renewal. Thus the <i>official superiority</i> of the Redeemer (which is all that our Evangelist here deals with) is fully brought out. The superiority of <i>nature </i>and <i>pre-existence</i> is reserved for the fuller and more dogmatic account in John i.<h2><u><b>12. whose fan,</b> &c.</u></h2> In the Rabbinical work Midrash Tehillim, on Ps. ii., the same figure is found: “The winnowing is at hand: they throw the straw into the fire, the chaff to the wind, but preserve the wheat in the floor; so the nations of the world shall be the conflagration of a<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/106VN0ytWZtnOeK2pCb7yDHoa9nVHi8Lr/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Or perhaps owing to the verb (<b>shall cleanse from one end to the other</b>), the <i>floor itself</i>, which was an open hard-trodden space in the middle of the field. See “The Land and the Book,” p. 538 ff., where there is an illustration. “Very little use is now made of the <i>fan</i>, but I have seen it employed to <i>purge the floor</i> of the refuse dust, which the owner throws away as useless,” p. 540.<h3><u><b>chaff</b></u></h3> Not only <i>the chaff</i>, but also <i>the straw</i>: see reff.: ‘all that is not wheat.’<h2><u><b>13—17.</b></u></h2> JESUS HIMSELF BAPTIZED BY HIM. Mark i. 9–11: Luke iii. 21, 22. It does not appear exactly <i>when the baptism of our Lord took place</i>. If the comparative age of the Baptist is taken into account, we should suppose it to have been about six months after this latter began his ministry. But this is no sure guide. The <i>place </i>was <i>Bethany </i>(the older reading), <i>beyond Jordan</i>; John. i. 28.<h2><u><b>13. to be baptized</b></u></h2> Why should our Lord, who was <i>without sin</i>, have come to <i>a baptism of repentance?</i> Because He was <i>made sin for us</i>: for which reason also He suffered the curse of the law. It became Him, being <i>in the likeness of sinful flesh</i>, to go through those appointed rites and purifications which belonged to that flesh. There is no more strangeness in His having been baptized by John, than in His keeping the Passovers. The one rite, as the other, belonged to sinners—and <i>among the transgressors He was numbered</i>. The prophetic words in Ps, xl. 12, spoken in the person of our Lord, indicate, in the midst of sinlessness, the most profound apprehension of the sins of that nature which He took upon him. I cannot suppose the baptism to have been sought by our Lord merely t<i>o honour John</i>, or as <i>knowing that it would be the occasion of a divine recognition</i> of his Messiahship, and thus pre-ordained by God: but <i>bonâ fide</i>, as bearing the infirmities and carrying the sorrows of mankind, and thus beginning here the triple baptism of water, fire, and blood, two parts of which were now accomplished, and of the third of which He himself speaks, Luke xii. 50, and the beloved Apostle, 1 John v. 8.—His baptism, as it was our Lord’s <i>closing </i>act of obedience under the Law, in His hitherto concealed life of legal submission, His fulfilling all righteousness, so was His <i>solemn inauguration and anointing for the higher official life of mediatorial satisfaction</i> which was now opening upon Him. See Rom. i. 3, 4. We must not forget that the <i>working out of perfect righteousness in our flesh</i> by the entire and spotless keeping of God’s law (Deut. vi. 25), was, in the main, <i>accomplished during the thirty years previous to our Lord’s official ministry.</i><br><br><b>14. forbad</b>) Rather, <b>tried to hinder</b>: the word implies the active and earnest preventing, with the gesture, or hand, or voice. There is only an <i>apparent </i>inconsistency between the speech of John in this sense, and the assertion made by him in John i, 33, ‘I knew him not.’ Let us regard the matter in this light :—John begins his ministry by a commission from God, who also admonishes him, that He, whose Forerunner he was, would be in time revealed to him by a special sign. Jesus comes to be baptized by him. From the nature of his relationship to our Lord, he could not but know those events which had accompanied his birth, and his subsequent life of holy and unblamable purity and sanctity. My impression from the words of this verse certainly is, that he <i>regarded Him as the Messiah</i>. Still, his belief wanted that full and entire assurance which the occurrence of the predicted sign gave him, which the word <b>knew </b>implies, and which would justify him in announcing Him to his disciples as the Lamb of God.<h2><u><b>15. now</b></u></h2> The exact meaning is difficult. It cannot well be that which the A. V. at first sight gives, that something was to be done <i>now</i>, inconsistent with the actual and hereafter-to-be-manifested relation of the two persons, Rather—‘<i>though what has been said</i> (ver, ]4) <i>is true, yet the time is</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AVhFtL9gXD5xntO8PsVNywim0qtrYJ78/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Stier remarks that now was fulfilled the prophetic announcement of Ps. xl. 7, 8.<h3><u><b>us</b></u></h3> not for me, but for me and thee. I cannot help thinking that this word glances at the relationship and previous acknowledged destinations of the speakers. It has however a wider sense, as spoken by Him who is now first coming forth officially as the <i>Son of Man</i>, extending over <i>all those whose baptism plants them in his likeness</i>, Rom. vi.<h3><u><b>righteousness</b></u></h3> <b>requirements of the law</b>. See ch. vi. 1, where the sense is general, as here.<h2><u><b>16. baptised</b></u></h2> On this account I would make the following remarks. (1) The appearance and voice seem to have been manifested to <i>our Lord and the Baptist only</i>. They may have been <i>alone </i>at the time: or, if not, we have an instance in Acts ix. 7, of such an appearance being confined to one person, while the others present were unconscious of it. We can hardly however, with some of the Fathers, say, that it was “<i>a spiritual beholding,</i>” — or that “<i>the appearance was a vision, not reality.</i>” (2) The Holy Spirit descended not only in the <i>manner </i>of a dove, but <i>in bodily shape</i> (|| Luke): which I cannot understand in any but the literal sense, as THE BODILY SHAPE OF A DOVE, seen by the Baptist. There can be no objection to this, the straightforward interpretation of the narrative, which does not equally apply to the Holy Spirit being <i>visible at all</i>, which John himself asserts Him to have been (John i. 32—34), even more expressly than is asserted here. Why the Creator Spirit may not have assumed an organized body bearing symbolical meaning, as well as any other material form, does not seem clear. This was the ancient, and is the <i>only honest</i> interpretation. All the modern explanations of the “<i>like a dove,</i>” as importing the <i>manner </i>of coming down belong to the vain rationalistic attempt to reduce down that which is miraculous. The express assertion of St. Luke, and the fact that all four Evangelists have used the same expression, which they would not have done if it were a mere medium of comparison, are surely a sufficient refutation of this rationalizing (and, I may add, blundering) interpretation. (3) Two circumstances may be noticed respecting the manner of the descent of the Spirit:it was, <i>as a dove</i> :—the Spirit as manifested in our Lord was <i>gentle </i>and <i>benign</i>. This was not a sudden and temporary descent of the Spirit, but a <i>permanent </i>though special anointing of the Saviour for his holy office. It ‘<i>abode upon Him,</i>’ John i. 32. And from this moment His ministry and mediatorial work (in the active official sense) begins. Immediately, the Spirit carries Him away to the wilderness: the day of His return thence (possibly; but see notes on John i. 29) John points Him out as the Lamb of God: then follows the calling of Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathanael, and the third day after is the first miracle at the marriage in Cana. But we must not imagine any <i>change </i>in the nature or person of our Lord to have taken place at his baptism. The anointing and crowning are but <i>signs </i>of the official assumption of the power which the king has by a right independent of, and higher than these. (4) The whole narrative is in remarkable parallelism with that of the Transfiguration. There we have our Lord supernaturally glorified in the presence of two great prophetic personages, Moses and Elias, who speak of His decease, —on the journey to which He forthwith sets out (ch. xvii. 22, compared with xix. 1); and accompanied by the same testimony of the voice from heaven, uttering the same words, with an addition accordant with the truth then symbolized. (5) In connexion with apocryphal additions, the following are not without interest: <i>When Jesus had gone down to the water, a flame was lit up in the Jordan: and when He had come up from the water, lo, the heavens</i>, &c.

Mark i. 12, 13: Luke iv. 1–13.<h2><u><b>1. led up of (by) the spirit</b></u></h2> The Spirit carried Him away, (see Acts viii. 39,) “<i>driveth him,</i>” Mark i. 12. Had St. Luke’s “<i>was led in</i> (thus literally) <i>the Spirit</i>” been our <i>only </i>account, we might have supposed what took place to have been done <i>in a vision</i>: but the expressions in the two other Evangelists entirely preclude this. The <i>desert </i>here spoken of may either be the traditional place of the Temptation near Jericho (thence called <i>Quarantaria</i>: it is described in “The Land and the Book,” p. 617, as a high and precipitous mountain, with its side facin the plain perpendicular, and apparently as high as the rock of Gibraltar, and with caverns midway below, hewn in the rock), or as scripture parallelism between Moses, Elias, and our Lord, leads one to think, the <i>Arabian desert of Sinai</i>. <b>to be tempted</b>] The express <i>purpose</i> of His being <i>led up</i>. Hence it is evident that our Lord this time wes not ‘led up’ of his own will and design: but, as a part of the conflict with the Power of Darkness, He was <i>brought </i>to the Temptation. As He had been subject to his earthly parents at Nazareth, so now He is subject, in the outset of his official course, to His Heavenly Parent, and is by His will thus carried up to be tempted. In reverently considering the nature and end of this temptation, we may observe, (1) That the whole is <i>undoubtedly an objective historical narrative</i>, recording an actual conflict between our Redeemer and the Power of Evil. (2) That it is undetermined by the <i>letter </i>of the sacred text, whether the Tempter appeared <i>in a bodily shape</i>, or, <i>as a spirit</i>, was permitted to exert a certain power, as in ver. 5, and ver. 8, over the person of our Lord, even as the Holy Spirit did in ver.1. If the latter were the case, the words spoken at the various of the temptation, were suggested by this Evil Power to the soul of our Redeemer. But (3) such an interpretation, while it cannot justly be accused of unreality by any who do not reject belief in the spiritual world, hardly meets the expressions of the text, “<i>came</i> (approached) <i>to him,</i>” ver. 9, and “<i>leaveth him</i>” ver. 11. Nor do the two members of ver. 11 correspond to one another in this case, for the angels must have been visible and corporeal, as in the parallel case at Gethsemane, Luke xxii. 43.<h2><u><b>2. when he had fasted</b></u></h2> Not in the wider ecclesiastical sense of the word, but its strict meaning, of <i>abstaining from all food whatever</i>; Luke, ver.2. Similarly Moses, Exod. xxxiv. 28; and Elijah, 1 Kings xix. 8.<h3><u><b>he was afterward an hungred</b></u></h3> Then probably <i>not during the time itself</i>. The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses, was Spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended.<h2><u><b>3. when the tempter came</b></u></h2> From the words of both St. Mark and St. Luke, it appears that our Lord was tempted <i>also during the forty days</i>. Whether the words of St. Mark, “<i>he was with the wild beasts,</i>” allude to <i>one kind</i> of temptation, is uncertain: see note on Mark i. 13.—The words “<i>came to him</i>” need not be understood of the <i>first </i>approach, but the first <i>recorded</i>— ‘at a certain time the tempter approaching, &c’<h3><u><b>If thou be</b></u></h3> “thinking to beguile Him with his flattery,” Chrys. Or, as Euthymius, “thinking that He would be irritated by this address, as being reproached with not being the Son of God.” At all events, there is no <i>doubt </i>expressed, as some think.<h3><u><b>Son of God</b></u></h3> Our Lord does not give way to the temptation, so as to meet him with an open declaration, ‘I am the Son of God:’ thus indeed He might have asserted his lordship over him, but not have been <i>his Conqueror for us</i>. The first word which He uses against him, reaches far deeper: ‘<i>Man</i> shall not live,’ &c. “This, like the other text, is taken from the history of Israel’s temptation in the wilderness: for Israel represents, in a foreshadowing type, the Son of Man, the servant of God Righteousness, the one that was <i>to come</i>, in whom alone that nature which in all men has degenerated into sin, ‘<i>fulfils all righteousness</i>’ Adam stood not,—Israel according to the flesh stood not,—when the Lord their God tempted them: but rather, after Satan’s likeness, tempted their God: but now the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSz76FMAC9EaGw_3N7yTR4yqO7NSiIZH/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Compare John iv. 32, 34.<h2><u><b>5. taketh him up</b></u></h2> power being most probably given to the tempter over the person of our Lord. In St. Luke, this temptation stands <i>third</i>. The real order is evidently that in the text; for otherwise our Lord’s final answer, ver. 10, would not be in its place. It may be observed, that St. Luke makes no assertion as to succession, only introducing each temptation with <i>and</i>: whereas “<i>then</i>” and “<i>again</i>” here seem to mark succession. For “the holy city” see reff.<br><br><b>setteth him</b> —by the same power by which he brought Him.<h3><u><b>pinnacle</b></u></h3> The general opinion, that our Lord was placed on <i>Herod’s royal portico</i>, is probably right. That portico overhung the ravine of Kedron from a dizzy height, so as to make one giddy with looking down, as described by Josephus, Antt. xv. 11. 5. The argument that it was probably <i>on the other side, next the court</i>, is grounded on the perfectly gratuitous assumption, that an <i>exhibition to the people</i> was intended. There is no authority for this in the text; the temptation being one not of ambition, but of <i>presumption</i>. The inference from Eusebius, who, quoting Hegesippus, (Hist. ii. 23) describes James the Just as set on and thrown from the pinnacle of the temple, among the people, is not decisive: for this term might embrace either side, as ‘the cornice,’ or ‘the parapet’ would.<h2><u><b>6. It is written</b></u></h2> cited (nearly verbatim from the LXX, as almost all the texts in this narrative) as applying to all servants of God in general, and à fortiori to the Son of God: not as a of the Messiah.<h2><u><b>7. again</b></u></h2> not ‘on the contrary,’ which the original word never simply means, not even in Gal. v. 3: 1 John ii. 8. The addition of a second Scripture <i>qualifies </i>and <i>interprets </i>the first; but <i>does not refute</i> it.<h2><u><b>8.</b></u></h2> The enquiry where and what this mountain was, is entirely nugatory, no data being furnished by the text.<h3><u><b>sheweth him all the k. of the world</b></u></h3> The additional words in Luke, “<i>in a moment of time,</i>” are valuable as pointing out to us clearly the supernatural character of the vision. If it be objected, that in that case there was no need for the ascent of the mountain,—I answer, that such natural accessories are made use of frequently in supernatural revelations: see especially Rev. xxi. 10. The attempts to restrict “the world” to <i>Palestine</i>, (which was, besides, God’s peculiar portion and vineyard, <i>as distinguished from</i> the Gentile world,) or <i>the Roman</i> empire, are mere subterfuges: as is also the giving to “sheweth” the sense of “points out the direction of.”<br><br>In this last temptation the enemy reveals himself openly, as the Prince of this world, and as the father of lies: for though power is given him over this world and its sons, his assertion here is most untrue.<h2><u><b>10.</b></u></h2> Our<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YsdYaMigMQs9Qh5GKcfgOniMSdqRpnNZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The conflict, however often renewed in secret (of which we cannot speak), was certainly <i>again waged in Gethsemane</i>: see Luke xxii. 53, compare John xiv. 30.

CALLING OF PETER, ANDREW, JAMES, AND JOHN. Mark i. 14—20. Luke iv. 14, 15. Between the last verse and this is a considerable interval of time. After returning from the Temptation (see note on John i. 28, end) our Lord was pointed out by John the Baptist, (ib. vv. 29—34,) and again on the morrow to two of his disciples, Andrew and (probably) John, who followed Him, and were (on the next day? see note, John i. 44) joined by Simon Peter (35—43): then on the morrow Philip and Nathanael we recalled (44—52); three days after was marriage in Cana (ii. 1- 11); then our Lord went down to Capernaum and remained not many days (12); then followed the Passover; the cleansing of the temple (13—22); the belief of many on Jesus (23—25); the discourse with Nicodemus (iii. 1—21); the baptizing by Jesus (i.e. his disciples) (22—24); the question about purifying, and testimony of the Baptist (25—36); the journey through Samaria into Galilee, and discourse with the woman of Samaria (iv. 1—42); the return to Cana, and healing of the ruler’s son in Capernaum (43—54); and the journey to Jerusalem related in John v. 1. After that chapter St. John breaks off the first part his narrative; and between his v. 47 and vi. 1, comes in the synoptic narrative, Matt. iv. 12—xiv. 15: Mark i.14—vi. 30: Luke iv. 14—ix. 10. This omission is in remarkable consistency with St. Matthew's account of his own calling in ch. ix. 9. Being employed in his business in the neighbourhood of Capernaum, he now first becomes personally acquainted with the words and actions of our Lord. From what circumstance the former miracle in Capernaum had not attracted his attention, we cannot, of course, definitely say; we can, however, easily conceive. Our Lord was not then <i>in </i>Capernaum; for the ruler sent to Him, and the cure was wrought by word at a distance. If Matthew’s attention had not been called to Jesus before, he might naturally omit such a narrative, which John gives probably from personal knowledge. The <i>synoptic narrative generally</i> omits this whole section of our Lord’s travels and ministry. Its sources of information, until the last visit to Jerusalem, seem to have been <i>exclusively Galilean</i>, and <i>derived from persons who became attached to Him at a later period than any of the events recorded in that first portion of John’s Gospel</i>. The objections to this view are, the narrative, in the three Gospels, of the baptism and temptation: but the former of these would be abundantly testified by John’s disciples, many of whom became disciples of Jesus; and the latter could only have been derived from the mouth of our Lord Himself.<h2><u><b>12. delivered up</b></u></h2> This seems to have been the usual and well-known term for the imprisonment of John. The same word in the original is also the usual one for the betrayal and apprehension of our Lord Himself.<h3><u><b>departed</b></u></h3> <b>re- tired, withdrew</b>; see ch. ii. 22, and note. No notice is given <i>whence </i>this withdrawal took place. The narrative is evidently taken up after an interval, and without any intention that it should follow closely on ver. 11. Wieseler sees in this a proof that St. Matthew recognized a ministry in Judæa during the interval. I cannot quite think this, but certainly he does not <i>exclude </i>it.<h2><u><b>13. leaving Nazareth</b></u></h2> Not on account of the behaviour of the Nazarenes to Him after the preaching in<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Z_uSkXwesX7LQZeZzLnLhFIAtjGaOJi/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It besides was the residence of four at least of the Apostles, Andrew and Peter, and James and John—and probably of Matthew. “<i>Kephar Nahum,</i>” <i>the village of consolation</i>. So Josephus. It is from this time called ‘<i>His own city,</i>’ ch. ix. 1, see also ch. xvii. 24.<h2><u><b>15.</b></u></h2> This prophecy is spoken with direct reference to the days of the Messiah. It is here freely rendered from the Hebrew, without any regard to the LXX, which is wholly different. This, coming so immediately after a string of quotations literally from the LXX, seems to mark the beginning of a new portion of the Gospel, agreeably to what was said before.<h3><u><b>the way of the sea</b></u></h3> the country round the coast of the lake. All the members of this sentence are in apposition with one another: thus <i>beyond Jordan</i> is not a description of the land before spoken of, which was not thus situated, but of a different tract. The later meaning of the phrase, as signifying the tract to the west of the Jordan, and which naturally sprung during the captivity, is not to be thought of in Isaiah, who wrote before that event.<h3><u><b>Galilee of the Gentiles</b></u></h3> <i>Galilee superior</i>, near to Tyre and Sidon, which was inhabited by a variety of nations.<h2><u><b>17. began to preach ..</b></u></h2> That is, <i>began His ministry in Galilee</i>. The account of Matthew, being that of an eyewitness, begins where his own experience began. It is not correct to suppose, as some of the German Commentators have done, (De Wette, Strauss,) that this preaching of repentance was <i>of a different character from the after-teaching of our Lord</i>: we recognize the same formula, though only partly cited, in ch. x.7: Luke x. 10, and find our Lord <i>still preaching repentance</i>, Luke xiii. 3, after repeated declarations of His Messiahship.<h2><u><b>18. by the sea of Galilee</b></u></h2> The lake of Gennesareth or Tiberias (John vi. 1), called in the O.T. “the sea of Chinnereth,” Num. xxxiv. 11, or Chinneroth, Josh. xii. 3. It is of an oval shape, about 13 geographical miles long, and 6 broad: and is traversed by the Jordan from N. to S. “Its most remarkable feature is its deep depression, being no less than 700 feet below the level of the ocean.” See the interesting article by Mr. Porter in Smith’s Biblical Dictionary.<br><br>If we give any consideration to the circumstances here related, we cannot fail to see that the account in John is admirably calculated to complete the narrative. We have there furnished to us the reason why these two brethren were so ready to arise and follow One, whom, if we had this account only, we should infer they had never before seen. Add to this, that there is every probability that one of the other pair of brethren, John the son of Zebedee, is there described as having gone with Andrew to the dwelling of our Lord. It also tends to confirm the chronological view here taken, that Philip, the only one mentioned expressly by John as <i>having been called by Jesus</i>, is <i>not mentioned here as called</i>: and that Andrew, and the other disciple of John the Baptist, clearly were not <i>called </i>by Jesus in John i. 35–40, or the words “<i>abode with him that day,</i>” could not have been used: that these two <i>continued </i>disciples of the Baptist, is not probable; but that they were henceforth,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Im1V2Onc86GQCpWNBmVGXFiv3pD8EvvU/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

I believe that the disciple whom Jesus loved was in His company during the whole of the events in John ii. iii. iv. and v., and on His return from Judea with His disciples, John having for a time returned to his business, as our Lord was now resident in Capernaum, received, as here related, this more solemn and final call. We must remember, that the disciples would naturally have gone up to Jerusalem at the Passover, John ii. 23, <i>without a call from the Lord</i>, and by what they saw there would become more firmly attached to him. The circumstance related in John xxi, that even after they were assured of the Resurrection, the Apostles <i>returned to their occupation</i> as fishermen, gives additional probability to the usual nation of the call in our text.<h2><u><b>20. left their nets, and followed him</b></u></h2> i.e. <i>from this time they were constant followers</i> of the Lord. But when He happened to be in the neighbourhood of their homes, they resumed their fishing; cf. Luke v. 1–11, which occurrence was, in my belief, different from, and later than the one related in our text. See notes there.<h2><u><b>23—25.</b></u></h2> HE MAKES A CIRCUIT OF GALILEE. (Mark i. 89: Luke iv. 44, ordinarily: but qu.? There is no necessity for believing this circuit of Galilee to be identical with those, even if we read <i>Galilee</i> in the passage in Luke. Our Lord made <i>many such circuits</i>.)<h2><u><b>23. synagogues</b></u></h2> These were the places of religious assembly among the Jews after the return from the captivity. Tradition, and the Targums, ascribe a very early origin to synagogues: and Deut. xxxi. 11, and Ps. lxxiv. 8, are cited as testimonies of it. But the former passage does not necessarily imply it: and it is doubtful whether that Psalm was not itself written after the captivity. They are generally supposed to have originated in Babylon, and thence to have been brought, at the return, into the mother land. See Neh. viii. 1–8. At the Christian era there were synagogues in every town, and in some larger towns several. See Acts ix. 2,20. In Jerusalem, according to the Rabbinical writings, there were upwards of 450. (See Acts vi. 9, and note.) The people assembled in them on sabbath and festival days, and in later times also on the second and fifth days of each week, for public prayer and the hearing of portions of Scripture. See Luke iv. 16: Acts xiii, 15. The officers of the synagogues were (1) <i>the ruler of the synagogue</i>, Luke viii. 49; xiii, 14: Acts xviii. 8, 17, who had the care of public order, and the arrangement of the service; (2) the Elders, Luke vii. 3: Mark v. 22: Acts xiii. 15, who seem to have formed a sort of council under the presidency of the Ruler; (3) the <i>legate </i>or <i>angel of the assembly</i>, who was the reader of prayers, and also secretary and messenger of the synagogues; (4) the <i>minister </i>(Luke iv. 20), or chapel clerk, whose office was to prepare the books for reading, to sweep, open, and shut the synagogue. Besides these, there appear to have been alms-gatherers. The synagogue was fitted up with seats, of which the first row were an object of ambition with the scribes (ch. xxiii. 6). A pulpit for the reader, lamps, and a chest, for keeping the sacred books, appear to complete the furniture of the ancient synagogue. Punishments, e.g. scourging, were inflicted in the synagogues. (See ch. x. 17; xxiii. 34: Luke ix. 49: Acts xxii. 19; xxvi.11.) The catechizing also of children seems to have taken place there, as also disputations on religious questions.—Our Lord was allowed to read and teach in the synagogues, although of mean extraction according to the flesh, because of His miracles, and His supposed character as the professed leader and teacher of a religious sect.<h3><u><b>preaching the gospel</b></u></h3> For the exact meaning of<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KJvlV0Gm6kZ-NSVFtiME6YE_O5Co2Jd/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In this form peculiar to Matthew.<br><br>Without attempting a solution of the many difficulties which beset the question of time, place, and arrangement of our Lord’s Sermon on the Mount, I shall state the principal views of these subjects, and make some remarks upon them. One of the weightiest questions is, as to <i>the identity or otherwise of the Sermon with that given in Luke</i> vi. 20—49. There is (I) the view that they <i>are identical</i>. This is generally taken by ordinary readers of Scripture, from their similarity in many points. It is also taken by most of the modern German Commentators, who uniformly reject every attempt at harmonizing by supposing the same or similar words to have been twice uttered. This view is, however, beset by difficulties. For (<i>a</i>) the Sermon in Luke is expressly said to have been delivered <i>after </i>the selection of the Apostles: whereas that in the text is as expressly, by continual consecutive notes of time extending to the call of Matthew (before which the Apostles cannot have chosen,) placed <i>before </i>that event. And it is wholly unlikely that St. Matthew, assuming him to be the author of our Gospel, would have made a discourse, which he must have heard immediately after his call as an Apostle, take place that call.— Then (<i>b</i>) <i>this</i> discourse was spoken on <i>a mountain</i>,—<i>that</i>, after descending from a mountain, in the <i>plain</i>. Possibly this may be got over, by rendering St. Luke's expression “on a level place.” See note on Luke: and the citation from Stanley below. And again (<i>c</i>), the two discourses are, though containing much common matter, <i>widely different</i>. Of 107 verses in Matt., Luke contains only <i>thirty</i>: <i>his four</i> beatitudes are balanced by as many <i>woes</i>: and in his text, parts of the sermon are introduced by sayings, which do not precede them in Matt. (e.g. Luke vi. 39 ff., 45 ff.), but which naturally connect with them. (II) St. Luke <i>epitomized</i> this discourse, leaving out whatever was unsuitable for his Gentile readers, e.g. ch: v. 17–38. But this is improbable: for Luke in several verses is <i>fuller </i>than Matthew, and the whole discourse, as related by him, is connected and consecutive. (III) The two discourses are <i>wholly distinct</i>. This view is maintained by Greswell, vol. ii, Diss. xi., and principally from the arguments above noticed. But it also is not without grave difficulties, especially if we suppose, as most do, that Luke had the Gospel of Matthew before him. That two discourses wholly distinct should contain so much in common, seems unlikely and unnatural. It is hardly credibly that two great public special occasions should be selected by the Lord near the commencement of His ministry, and two discourses delivered to the same audience, not <i>identical</i>, which might have been very probable, and impressive from that very circumstance,—nor consecutive, nor explanatory the one of the other, but, only coinciding in fragments, and not even as two different reports at the distance of some years might be expected to do.

(IV) St. Matthew <i>gives a general compendium of the sayings of our Lord during this part of His ministry</i>, of which St. Luke’s discourse formed a <i>portion</i>, or perhaps was <i>another shorter compendium</i>. But the last stated objection applies with still greater force to this hypothesis, and renders it indeed quite untenable. Besides, it labours under the chronological difficulty in all its bearings. And to one who has observed throughout the close contextual connexion of the parts in this discourse, it will be quite incredible that they should be a mere collection of sayings, set down at hazard. See notes throughout. (V) The apparent discrepancies are sometimes reconciled by remembering, that <i>there is no fixed time mentioned in any Evangelist for the special ordination of the Apostles</i>, and that it is very doubtful whether they were at any set moment so ordained all together. Thus Matthew may have been a usual hearer of our Lord, and present with the whole of the Apostles, as related in Luke, though not yet formally summoned as related in Matt. ix. 9 ff. The introduction of the discourse in Luke by the words “<i>And it came to pass in those days</i>” (which I maintain to be, on Luke vi. 12, not only <i>possibly</i>, but <i>expressly </i>indefinite, and to indicate that the event so introduced may have happened at any time during the current great period of our Lord’s ministry, before, during, or after, those last narrated,) allows us great latitude in assigning Luke’s discourse to any precise time. This, however, leaves the difficulties (above stated under I) in supposing the discourses identical, in force, except the chronological one.—With regard to the many sayings of this sermon which occur, dispersed up and down, in Luke, see notes in their respective places, which will explain my view as to their connexion and original times of utterance, in each several instance. See also notes on Luke vi. 20—49.<h2><u><b>1. the mountain</b></u></h2> Either <i>some hill</i> near Capernaum well known by this name, and called by it in the reff. to Mark and Luke, (tradition, not earlier probably than the Crusades, which points out a hill between Capernaum and Tiberias as the Mount of Beatitudes, near the present Saphet, is in such a matter worthless as an authority. But the situation seems to modern travellers [see Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 368] “so strikingly to coincide with the intimations of the narrative, as almost to force the inference that in this instance the eye of those who selected the was for once rightly guided. It is the only height seen in this direction from the shores of the lake of Gennesareth. The plain on which it stands is easily accessible from the lake, and from that plain to the summit is but a few minutes’ walk. The platform at the top is evidently suitable for the collection of a multitude, and corresponds precisely to the ‘level place’ to which He would ‘come down’ as from one of its higher horns to address the people. Its situation is central both to the peasants of the Galilean hills, and the fishermen of the Galilean lake, between which it stands, and would therefore be a natural resort both to Jesus and His disciples when they retired for solitude from the shores of the sea, and also to the crowds who assembled ‘from Galilee, from Decapolis, from Jerusalem, from Judæa, and from beyond Jordan.’ None of the other mountains in the neighbourhood could answer equally well to this description, inasmuch as they are merged into the uniform barrier of hills round the lake: whereas this stands separate — ‘the mountain,’ which alone could lay claim to a distinct name, with the exception of the one height of Tabor, which is too distant to answer the requirements,”) or <i>the mountain district</i>, certainly imported by the word in ch. xiv. 23.—See a full description of the locality in Tholuck, Bergpredigt, ed. 3, pp. 63 ff.<h3><u><b>his disciples</b></u></h3> in the wider sense: including those of the Apostles already called, and all who had, either for a long or a short time, attached themselves to him as hearers.

The discourse (see vv. 13, 14, 20, 48; ch. vi. 9; vii. 6) was spoken directly to the disciples, but (see vii. 28, 29) also generally to the multitudes. It is a divine commentary on the words with which His own and the Baptist’s preaching opened: “<i>Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</i>” It divides itself into various great sections, which see below.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WWeFavVWhI1JncjrlMsj7SHc7Umub6TO/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 92:</a></h3><br><h2><u><b>3—16.</b></u></h2> THE DESCRIPTION OF the LORD’S DISCIPLES, THEIR BLESSEDNESS< AND DIGNITY.<h2><u><b>3. the poor in spirit</b></u></h2> “He said not, the poor in possessions, but ‘in spirit:’ i.e. the lowly in purpose and in soul.” Euthymius. “What is ‘the poor in spirit?’ the humble and contrite in heart.” Chrys.—The meaning of <i>voluntary poverty</i>, as that of the religious orders, given by some of the Fathers, and many; Romish interpreters, is <i>out of the question</i>. As little can the <i>bare literal</i> sense of the words, which Julian scoffed at, be understood: viz. those who are <i>ill-furnished in mind</i>, and uneducated. See Rev. iii. 17. The idea (De Wette) is not improbable, that our Lord may have had a reference to the poor and subjugated Jewish people around him, once members of the theocracy, and now expectants of the Messiah’s temporal kingdom; and, from their condition and hopes, taken occasion to preach to them the deeper spiritual truth.<h3><u><b>their’s is the kingdom of heaven</b></u></h3> See Luke iv. 17—21: James ii. 5. The kingdom must here be understood in its widest sense: as the combination of all rights of Christian citizenship in this world, and eternal blessedness in the next, ch. vi. 33. But Tholuck well observes, that all the senses of “<i>the kingdom of God,</i>” or “<i>of heaven,</i>” or “<i>of Christ,</i>” are only different sides of the same great idea—the <i>subjection of all things to God in Christ.</i><h2><u><b>4.</b></u></h2> The spiritual qualification in the former verse must be carried on to this, and the mourning understood to mean not only that on account of sin, but <i>all such as happens to a man in the spiritual life</i>. All such mourners are blessed: for the Father of mercies and God of all consolation being their covenant God, His comfort shall overbear all their mourning, and taste the sweeter for it. In Luke ii. 25, the Messiah’s coming is called “<i>the consolation of Israel.</i>”—This beatitude is by many editors placed after ver. 5. But the authority is by no means decisive, and I cannot see how the logical coherence of the sentence is improved by it.—In placing these two beatitudes first, the Lord follows the order in Isa. lxi. 1, which He proclaimed in the synagogue at Nazareth, Luke iv. 18.<h2><u><b>5. the meek</b></u></h2> A citation from Ps. xxxvii. 11. The usual dividers and allotters of the earth being mighty and proud conquerors, and the Messiah being expected as such a conqueror, this announcement that the meek should inherit the earth, struck at the root of the temporal expectations of power and wealth in the Messiah’s kingdom. This meekness is not mere outward lowliness of demeanour, but that true <i>meekness</i> of Eph. iv. 2, whose active side is love, and its passive side long-suffering. On the promise, compare Isa. lvii. 13–15; lx. 21; 1 Cor. iii. 22. That kingdom of God which begins in the hearts of the disciples of Christ, and is not “of (sprung from) <i>this world,</i>” shall work onwards till it shall become <i>actually a kingdom over this earth</i>, and its subjects shall <i>inherit the earth</i>: first in its millennial, and finally in its renewed and blessed state for ever.<h2><u><b>6.</b></u></h2> See Ps. cvii. 9; lxv. 4; xxii. 26: Isa. xli. 17. This <i>hunger and thirst</i> is the true sign of that new life on which those born of the Spirit (John iii. 3, 5) have entered; and it is after <i>righteousness</i>, i.e. <i>perfect conformity to the holy will of God</i>. This was <i>His </i>meat, John iv. 34, They shall be <i>satisfied—in the new heaven and new earth, in which dwelleth righteousness</i>, 2 Pet. iii. 13. Compare the remarkable parallel Ps. xvii. 15. This hunger and thirst after righteousness, is admirably set forth in the three first petitions of the Lord’s prayer,—‘Hallowed be Thy name—Thy kingdom come—Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.’<h2><u><b>7. merciful</b></u></h2> “We may shew mercy, not by alms only, but by words: and if we have no other way, by tears. For manifold is the form of mercy, and wide is this command: They shall obtain mercy, here, from men; and there, from God,” Euthymius, expanding Chrysostom. This beatitude comprises every degree of sympathy and mutual love and help; from that fulness of it which is shed abroad in those who have been forgiven much, and therefore love much,—down to those first beginnings of the new birth, even among those who know not the Lord,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hjFrQm9PbuINsB3JQSrcI4wA_dIyDpT/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is no Levitical cleanness, nor mere moral purity, that is here meant; but that <i>inner purity</i>, which (Acts xv. 9) is brought about by faith, has its fruit (1 Tim. i. 5) in <i>love</i>; which is opposed to all “<i>double mindedness</i>”’ (James i. 8), and all hypocrisy and outward colouring; so that pure in heart are those who have their “<i>hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.</i>” There is an allusion to the nearer vision of God attained by progressive sanctification, of which St. Paul speaks, 2 Cor. iii. 18,— begun indeed in this life, but not perfected till the next, 1 Cor. xiii. 12.<h2><u><b>9. peacemakers</b></u></h2> More than ‘<i>the peaceful</i>’ (Vulg.). is doubtful whether the word ever has this meaning. Thus Euthymius, mostly after Chrysostom: They who not only are themselves not men of strife, but make peace between others when at strife. They shall be called sons of God, because they have imitated His only Son; whose office it is to bring together the separated and to reconcile those at variance. But even thus we do not seem to reach the full meaning, which probably is, “<i>they that work peace;</i>” not confining the reference to the reconciliation of persons at variance: see note on James iii. 18.<h3><u><b>shall be called</b></u></h3> <i>implies </i>the reality, as in ver. 19; <b>shall</b> (not only be, but also) <b>be called</b>, i.e. recognized, in the highest sense, both generally, and by the Highest Himself, as such. Let it ever be remembered, according to the order of these beatitudes, and the assertion of James iii. 17, that the wisdom from above is <b>first</b> <i>pure</i>, <b>then </b><i>peaceable</i>, implying no compromise with evil. And it is in the working out of this purity that Luke xii. 51 is especially true. St. Augustine remarks, that martyrs are made not by the mere fact of suffering, but by the <i>cause </i>for which they suffer. And therefore it is added, ‘<i>for righteousness’ sake.</i>’<h2><u><b>10. persecuted</b></u></h2> See 1 Pet. iii. 14; iv. 14, which probably refers to this verse. The repitition of the promise in ver. 8 is a close of the string of promises as it began.<h2><u><b>11.</b></u></h2> With the preceding verse the beatitudes end, in their general reference, and in this our Lord addresses <i>His disciples</i> particularly. The actions described in this verse are the expansion of <b>persecuted </b>in the last.<h2><u><b>12. your reward</b></u></h2> A reward, not of debt, but of grace, as parable in ch. xx. 1 ff. clearly represents it. ‘An expression,’ as De Wette observes, ‘taken from our earthly commerce, and applied to spiritual things;” in which however we must remember, that the principal reference is to God as the giver, and not to us as the deservers: see the parable above cited, where the reward is not what was <i>earned</i>, but what was <i>covenanted</i>. These words, <i>in heaven</i>, must not be taken as having any bearing on the question as to the <i>future habitation</i> of the glorified saints. Their use in this end similar expressions is <i>not local</i>, but <i>spiritual</i>, indicating the blessed state when the kingdom of heaven shall have fully come. The local question is to be decided by wholly different testimonies of Scripture;— by the general tenor of prophecy, and the analogies of the divine dealings: and all of these seem to point rather to this earth, purified and renewed, than to <i>the heavens</i> in any ordinary sense of the term, as the eternal habitation of the blessed.<h3><u><b>so persecuted they</b></u></h3> For instance, Jeremiah was scourged, Jer. xx. 2; Zechariah son of Jehoiada was stoned, 2 Chron. xxiv. 21; Isaiah, according to Jewish tradition, was sawn asunder by Manasseh.—The reasoning implied in ‘for’ may be thus filled up: ‘and great will be <i>their </i>reward in heaven.”<br><br><b>13.</b>) The transition from the preceding verses is easy and natural, from the “<i>persecuted for righteousness’ sake,</i>” of which vv. 11, 12 were a sort of application, and the allusion to the ancient Prophets, to “<i>ye are the salt of the earth.</i>”—Elisha <i>healed the unwholesome</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yXDXupsjN1NcsUy1f8BdQsMUjDPZmLfJ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Yet it is worth noticing, that Maundrell, in his travels, found salt in the Valley of Salt, near Gehul, which had the appearance, but not the taste, having lost it by exposure to the elements (see the citation below);—and that Schǒttgen maintains that a kind of bitumen from the Dead Sea was called ‘salt of Sodom,’ and was used to sprinkle the sacrifices in the temple; which salt was used, when its savour was gone, to strew the temple pavement, that the priests might not slip. This, however, is but poorly made out by him. Dr. Thomson, ‘The Land and the Book,’ p. 381, mentions a case which came under his own observation: where a merchant of Sidon had stored up a quantity of salt in cottages with earthern floors, in consequence of which the salt was spoiled, and Dr. T. saw “large quantities of it literally thrown into the street, to be trodden under foot of men and beasts.” He adds, “It is a well-known fact that the salt of this country, when in contact with the ground, or exposed to rain and sun, does become insipid and useless. From the manner in which it is gathered, much earth and other impurities are necessarily collected with it. Not a little of it is so impure that it cannot be used at all: and such salt soon effloresces and turns to dust— not to fruitful soil, however. It is not only good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility wherever it is thrown: and this is the reason why it is cast into the street.”<br><br><b>the earth</b> means <i>mankind, and all creation</i>: but with a more <i>inward </i>reference, as to the working of the salt, than in “<i>the world,</i>” ver. 14, where the <i>light</i> is something <i>outwardly shewn</i>.<h3><u><b>shall it be salted</b></u></h3> it, i.e. the salt. The sense is: ‘If you become untrue to your high calling, and spiritually effete and corrupted, there are no ordinary means by which you can be re-converted and brought back to your former state, inasmuch as you have no teachers and guides over you, but ought yourselves to be teachers and guides to others.’ But we must not from this suppose that our Lord denies all repentance to those who have thus fallen: the scope of His saying must be taken into account, which is not to crush the fallen, but to quicken the sense of duty, and cause His disciples to walk worthily of their calling. (See Heb. vi. 4–6, and note on Mark ix. 49, 50.)<br><br>The <i>salt in the sacrifice</i> is the type of God’s <i>covenant of sanctification,</i> whereby this earth shall be again hallowed for Him: His people are the <i>instruments</i>, in His hand, of this wholesome salting: all His servants in general, but the teachers and ministers of His covenant in particular. There docs not appear to be any allusion to <i>ecclesiastical excommunication</i>.<h2><u><b>14. the light of the world</b></u></h2> And yet only in a lower and derivative sense; Christ Himself being “<i>the true light which lighteth every man,</i>” John i. 9; “the light of the world,” viii. 12. His ministers are “<i>candles,</i>” John v. 35, and “lights,” Phil. ii. 15, <i>receiving </i>their light, and only burning <i>for a time</i>: lights <i>lighted</i>, whereas He is Light <i>lighting</i>, as Augustine. And here too, light in this verse = candle in ver. 15, where the comparison is resumed. so also Eph. v. 8:—<b>light</b>, <i>as partaking of His Light</i>: for every thing lighted (see note, ib. ver. 13) is light.<h3><u><b>cannot be hid</b></u></h3> Of course it is possible that our Lord may have had <i>some town</i> before Him thus situated, but <i>not Bethulia</i>, whose very existence is probably fabulous, being only mentioned in the apocryphal book of Judith. Recent travellers, as Dr. Stanley and Thomson (Sinai and Palestine, p. 429: The Land and the Book, p. 273), have thought that, notwithstanding the fact shewn by Robinson, that the actual city of Safed was not in existence at this time, some ancient portion of it, at all events its fortress, which is ‘as aged in appearance as the most celebrated ruins in the country’ (Thomson), may have been before the eye of our Lord as He spoke. It is ‘placed high on a bold spur of the Galilean Anti-Lebanon,’ and answers well to the description of a city ‘lying on the mountain top.’ ‘The only other in view would be the village and fortress of Tabor, distinctly visible from the mount of Beatitudes, though not from the hills on the lake side.

But the CHURCH OF GOD, the <i>city on a hill</i> (Isa. ii. 2: Gal. iv. 26: see also Heb. xii. 22), in allusion to their present situation, on a mountain, is most probably leading thought.<h2><u><b>15. do men light</b></u></h2> literally, <b>do they light</b>: shewing, in the spiritual reference of the parable, that these lights of the world are ‘<i>lighted</i>’ by Him for whose use they are. See above.<h2><u><b>16. so</b></u></h2> i.e. <i>like a candle on a candlestick—like a city on a hill</i>; not merely, ‘so... that,’ as our English version seems rather to imply. By rendering in like manner, the ambiguity will be avoided. The sense of this verse is as if it were “<i>that, seeing your good works they may &c.</i>” . . . the <i>latter </i>verb, and not the former, carrying the purpose of the action. Thus the praise and glory of a well-lighted and brillant feast would be given, not to the lights, but to the master of the house; and of a stately city on a hill, not to the buildings, but to those who built them.<br><br>The whole of this division of our Lord’s sermon is addressed to <i>all His followers</i>, not exclusively to the ministers of his word. All servants of Christ are the salt of the earth, the light of the world (Phil. ii. 15). And all that is here said applies to us all. But à fortiori does it apply in its highest sense, to those who are, among Christians, selected to teach and be examples; who are as it were the towers and pinnacles of the city, not only not hid, but seen far and wide above the rest.<h2><u><b>17—48.</b></u></h2><i> The</i> SECOND PART OF THE SERMON, <i>in which our Lord sets forth His relation, as a lawgiver, to the law of Moses, especially as currently interpreted according to the letter only</i><h2><u><b>17. I am come</b></u></h2> more properly, <b>I came</b>. Observe how our Lord, through the whole sermon, sets forth Himself, in his proceeding forth from God, as truly “<i>He that was to come.</i>”<h3><u><b>the law, or the prophets</b></u></h3> It is a question whether our Lord includes the <i>prophecies</i>, properly so called, in His meaning here. I think <i>not</i>: for no person professing himself to be the Messiah would be thought to <i>contradict the prophecies</i>, but <i>to fulfil them</i>. Neither, it appears, does He <i>here </i>allude to the <i>sacrificial</i> and <i>typical </i>parts of the law, but to the<i> moral</i> parts of both the law and the prophets; which indeed he proceeds to cite and particularize. If however we prefer to include both ceremonial and moral in this assertion, we may understand it in its more general sense, as applying, beyond the instances here given, to His typical fulfilment of the law, which could not as yet be unfolded.<h3><u><b>to fulfil</b></u></h3> This verb implies more than the <i>mere fulfilling</i>: it has the sense of <b>filling out</b> or expanding: i.e. here, giving a deeper and holier sense to—fulfilling in the <i>spirit</i>, which is nobler than the letter. Theophylact compares the ancient law to a <i>sketch</i>, which the painter does not wipe out, but fills in. The gnostic Marcion characteristically enough maintained that the Judaizing Christians had altered this verse, and that it originally stood,—think ye that I came to <i>fulfil</i>, &c.? I came to <i>destroy</i>, not to <i>fulfil</i>.<h2><u><b>18. verily</b></u></h2> literally, <b>Amen</b>: equivalent to “<i>truly</i>” in St. Luke, ix. 27; xii. 44; xxi. 3. <b>jot (Iota)</b> is the Hebrew Jod, the smallest letter in the alphabet: <b>tittles</b>, literally <b>horns</b>, <i>horn-like projections</i>, are the little turns of the strokes by which one Hebrew letter differs from another similar to it. The Rabbinical writings have many sayings similar in sentiment to this, but spoken of the <i>literal</i> written law.<br><br>It is important to observe in <i>these days</i> how the Lord here <i>includes</i> <i>the O.T. and all its unfolding of the divine purposes regarding Himself, in His teaching</i> of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven. I say this, because it is always in <i>contempt and setting aside of the O.T.</i> that rationalism has begun. First, <i>its historical truth</i>—then <i>its theocratic dispensation</i> and the <i>types </i>and <i>prophecies </i>connected with it, are swept away; so that Christ came to fulfil nothing, and becomes only a teacher or a martyr: and thus the way is paved for a similar rejection of the N.T.;—beginning with the narratives of the birth<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18emL-PLhyMBQMXuSMe-44tMOuDAHuDNm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It should be a maxim for every expositor and every student, that Scripture is a <i>whole</i>, and stands or falls together. That this is now beginning to be deeply felt in Germany, we have cheering testimonies in the later editions of their best Commentators, and in the valuable work of Stier on the discourses of our Lord. [Since however these words were first written, we have had lamentable proof in England, that their warnings were not unneeded. The course of unbelief which has issued in the publication of the volume entitled “ Essays and Reviews,” has been in character and progress, exactly that above described: and owing to the injudicious treatment which has multiplied tenfold the circulation of that otherwise contemptible work, its fallacies are now in the hands and mouths of thousands, who, from the low standard of intelligent Scriptural knowledge among us, will never have the means of answering them. 1862. To this it may now be added, that even a Bishop of the Church of England has come before the world as a champion of that unbelief, in its first phase as described above. We may hope that his work, judging from the blunders already in the renderings of Hebrew words on which his arguments are founded, will soon be added to the catalogue of attacks by which the enemies of our holy faith have damaged nothing save their own reputation and influence. 1863.] <h2><u><b>19.</b></u></h2> There is little difficulty in this verse, if we consider it in connexion with the verse preceding, to which it is bound by the <b>therefore </b>and the <b>these</b>, and with the following, to which the <b>for </b>(ver. 20) unites it. Bearing this in mind, we see (1) that <b>break</b>, on account of what follows in ver. 20 and after, must be taken in the higher sense, as referring to the <i>spirit</i> and not the letter: <b>whosoever shall break</b> (have broken), in the sense presently to be laid down. (2) That <b>these least commandments</b> refers to <b>one jot or tittle</b> above, and means one of these minute commands which seem as insignificant, in comparison with the greater, as the <i>jot </i>and <i>tittle </i>in comparison with great portions of writing. (3) That <b>shall be called least</b> does not mean ‘<i>shall be excluded from,</i>” inasmuch as the question is not of <i>keeping or not keeping</i> the commandments of in a legal sense, but of <i>appreciating, and causing others to appreciate</i>, the import and weight of even the most insignificant parts of God’s revelation of Himself to man; and rather therefore applies to teachers than to Christians in general, though to them also through the “<i>break</i>” and “<i>do.</i>” (4) That <i>no deduction can be drawn from these words, binding the Jewish law, or any part of it, as such, upon Christians</i>. That this is so, is plainly shewn by what follows, where our Lord proceeds to pour upon the letter of the law the fuller light of the spirit of the Gospel: thus lifting and expanding (not destroying) every jot and tittle of that precursory dispensation into its fall meaning in the life and practice of the Christian; who, by the indwelling of the divine Teacher, God’s Holy Spirit, is led into all truth and purity. (5) That <i>these words of our Lord are decisive against such persons, </i>whether ancient or modern<i>, as would set aside the Old Testament as without significance, or inconsistent with the New</i>.

They generally appear in the N.T. in connexion with the Pharisees: but it appears from Acts xxiii. 9, that there were Scribes attached to the other sects also. In Matt. xxi. 15, they appear with the chief priests; but it is in the <i>temple</i>, where (see also Luke xx. 1) they acted as a sort of police. In the description of the assembling of the great Sanhedrim (Matt. xxvi. 3: Mark xiv. 53; xv. 1) we find it composed of c<i>hief priests</i>, <i>elders</i>, and <i>Scribes</i>: and in Luke xxii. 66, of <i>chief priests</i> and <i>Scribes</i>. The Scribes uniformly opposed themselves to our Lord; watching Him to find matter of accusation, Luke vi. 7; xi. 53, 54; perverting His sayings, Matt. ix. 3, and His actions, Luke v. 30; xv. 2; seeking to entangle Him by questions, Matt. xxii. 35 (see note there); Luke x. 25; xx. 21; and to embarrass Him, Matt. xii. 38. Their authority as expounders of the law is recognized by our Lord Himself, Matt. xxiii. 1, 2; their adherence to the oral traditionary exposition proved, Matt. xv. 1 ff.; the respect in which they were held by the people shewn, Luke xx. 46; their existence indicated not only in Jerusalem, but also in Galilee, Luke v. 17,—and in Rome, Josephus, Antt. xviii. 3.5. They kept schools and auditories for teaching the youth, Luke ii. 46; Acts v. 34, compared with xxii. 3; are called by Josephus <i>expounders of our patriarchal laws</i>, Antt. xvii. 6. 2; <i>sophists</i>, B.J. i. 33. 2. The literal rendering is “<b>shall abound more than the Scribes and Pharisees,</b>” i.e. more than that <i>of the S.</i> and <i>P.</i> Notice, that not only the <i>hypocrites </i>among the Scribes and Pharisees are here meant; but the declaration is, “ Your righteousness must be of a <i>higher order</i> than any yet attained, or conceived, by Scribe or Pharisee.”<h3><u><b>ye shall in no case enter, &c.</b></u></h3> A very usual formula (see ch. vii. 21; xviii. 3; xix. 17, 23, 24: John iii. 5 al.); implying exclusion from the blessings of the Christian state, and from the inheritance of eternal life.<h2><u><b>21—48.</b></u></h2> <i>Six examples of the true</i> FULFILMENT <i>of the law by Jesus</i>.—FIRST EXAMPLE. <i>The law of murder</i>.<h2><u><b>21. Ye have heard</b></u></h2> viz. by the reading of the law in the synagogues, and the expositions of the Scribes.<h3><u><b>by them of old time</b></u></h3> In this case, Moses and his traditional expounders are classed together; but the words may also be rendered, ‘<i>to</i> the ancients,’—which last interpretation seems to me to be certainly the right one. Meyer has well observed that “it was said to them of old time” corresponds to “but I say to you,” and the “I” to the understood subject of “was said.” He has not, however, apprehended the deeper truth which underlies the omission of the <i>subject </i>of <i>was said</i>, that it was the <i>same person</i> who said both. It will be noticed that our Lord does not here speak against the <i>abuse </i>of the law by tradition, but that every instance here given is either from <i>the law itself</i>, or <i>such traditional teaching as was in accordance with it</i> (e.g. the latter part of this verse is only a formal expansion of the former). The contrasts here are not between <i>the</i> <i>law misunderstood and the law rightly understood</i>, but between the <i>law and its ancient exposition</i>, which in their letter, and as given, were <i>empty</i>,—and <i>the same as spiritualized, fulfilled, by Christ</i>: not between <i>two lawgivers</i>, Moses and Christ, but between <i>they of old time</i> and <i>you</i>; between (the idea is Chrysostom’s) the children by the same husband, of the <i>bondwoman </i>and of the <i>freewoman</i>. The above remarks comprise a brief answer to the important but somewhat misapprehended question, whether a impugned the Mosaic law itself, or only its inadequate interpretation by the Jewish teachers? There is no inconsistency in the above view with the assertion in ver. 19: the just and holy and true law was necessarily restricted in meaning and degraded in position, until He came, whose office it was to fulfil and glorify it.<h3><u><b>the judgment</b></u></h3> viz. the courts in every city, ordered Deut. xvi. 18, and explained by Josephus Antt. iv. 8. 14 to consist of seven men, and to have the power of life and death. But “<i>the judgment</i>” in the next verse (see note) is the court of judgment in the Messiah’s kingdom.<br><br><b>23.</b>) The sense is: ‘There were among the Jews three well-known degrees of guilt, coming respectively under the cognizance of the local and the su e courts; and after these is set the Gehenna of fire, the end of the malefactor, whose corpse, thrown out into the valley of Hinnom, was devoured by the worm or the flame.

Dr. Thomson, “The Land and the Book,” p. 256, believes the Huleh lily to be meant : “ it is very large, and the three inner petals meet above, and form a gorgeous canopy, such as art never approached, and king never sat under, even in his utmost glory. And when I met this incomparable flower, in all its love- Tiness, among the oak woods around the northern base of Tabor, and on the hills of Nazareth, where our Lord spent His youth, I felt assured that it was this to which He referred.” Probably, however, the word here may be taken in a wider im- port, as signifying all wild flowers.<h2><u><b>29.</b></u></h2> We here have the declaration of the Creator Himself concerning the relative glory and beauty of all human pomp, com- ed with the meanest of His own works. 2 Chron. ix. 15—28. And the mean- ing hidden beneath the text should not escape the student. As the beauty of the flower is unfolded by the divine Creator Spirit from <i>within</i>, from the laws and capacities of its <i>own</i> individual life, so must all true adornment of man be un- folded <i>from within</i> by the same Almighty Spirit. See 1 Pet. iii. 3,4. As nothing from without can defile a man, (ch. xv. 11,) so neither can any thing from without adorn him. Our Lord introduces with <b>“I say unto you”</b> His revelations of omniscience : see ch. xviii. 10, 19.<h2><u><b>30. the grass</b></u></h2> The wild flowers which form part of the meadow-growth are counted as belonging to the grass, and are cut down with it. Cat grass, which soon withers from the heat, is still used in the East for firing. See “The Land and the Book,” p. 341. <b>the oven</b>] “a covered earthen vessel, a pan, wider at the bottom than at the top, wherein bread was baked by putting hot embers round it, which produced a more equable heat than in the regular oven.” Wilkinson and Webeter’s note. <b>32. for your heavenly Father knoweth</b>] This second “<b>for</b>” brings in an <i>additional</i> reason. <b>33. seek ye first</b>] Not with any reference to seeking these things <i>after</i> our religious duties, e. g. beginning with prayer days of avarice and worldly anxiety, but <b>make your great Object, as we say, your first care.</b><h3><u><b>his righteousness</b></u></h3> Not here the <i>forensic righteousness of justification</i>, but the <i>spiritual purity</i> inculcated in this discourse. <b>His</b> <i>righteousness</i> answers to <i>His perfection</i>, spoken of in ch. v. 48, and is another reference to the being as our heavenly Father is. In the Christian life which has been since unfolded, the righteousness of justification is a <i>necessary condition</i> of likeness to God ; but it is not the righteousness <i>here</i> meant. <b>shall be added unto you</b>] There is a traditional saying of our Lord, “<i>Ask ye for great things, and small things shall be added unto you: ask for heavenly things, and earthly things shall be added unto you</i>.”<h2><u><b>34</b></u></h2> literally, <b>for the morrow will care for it, viz. for itself</b>, the morrow mentioned above: i.e. <i>will bring care enough about its own matters</i>: implying,— after all your endeavour to avoid worldly cares, you will find quite enough and more of them when to-morrow comes, about<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yolhYkHGCJzVBrqrpW0KnWtjOJmKB2ES/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For if the command were merely “not to form authoritative judgments of others,’ the second member, “<i>that ye be not judged,</i>” would not, in its right interpretation, as applying to <i>God’s</i> judgment of <i>us</i>, correspond. And the ‘<i>condemn not</i>,” which follows in Luke vi. 87, is perhaps to be taken rather as an additional explanation of <i>judge</i>, than as a climax after it. <b>judged</b>] i.e. ‘<i>by God,</i>’ for so doing ;—a parallel expression to ch. v. 7; vi. 15; not ‘<i>by others.</i>’ The bare passive, without the agent expressed, is solemn and emphatic.

The<h2><u>sense then is, ‘that you have not to answer before God for your rash judgment and its consequences.’ The same remarks apply to ver. 2. <b>3—5.</b></u></h2> Lightfoot produces instances of this proverbial saying among the Jews. With them, however, it seems only to be used of a person retaliating rebuke; whereas our rd gives us a further application of it, viz. to the incapability of one involved in personal iniquity to form a right judgment on others, and the clearness given to the spiritual vision by conflict with and victory over evil. ere is also no doubt here a lesson given us of the true relative magnitude which our own faults, and those of our brother, ought to hold in our estimation. What is a <i>mote</i> to one looking on another, is to that other himself a <i>beam</i>: just the reverse of the ordinary estimate. <b>3.</b>] <b>beholdest</b>, from with- out, a voluntary act: <b>considerest</b> <b>not,</b> <b>apprehendest not,</b> from within, that which is already there, and ought to have excited attention before.

It is united by definite marks of date with what goes before; and by intimate connexion with what follows. It cannot by any unfairness be severed from its context. Nor again is there any thing mentioned which casts a doubt on the reality of the appearances (see below, on vision, ver. 9). The persons mentioned <i>were seen all—spoke—and were recognized.</i> The concurrence between the three Evangelists is exact in all the circumstances, and the fourth alludes, not obscurely, to the event, which it was not part of his purpose to relate; John i. 14. Another of the three spectators distinctly makes mention of the facts here related, 2 Pet. i. 16—18. I cannot but add, having recently returned from the sight of the wonderful original at Rome, that the great last picture of Raffaelle is one of the best and noblest comments on this portion of the Gospel history. - The events passing, at the same time, on, and under, the Mount of Transfiguration, are by the painter combined, to carry to the mind of the spectator the great central truth, <i>There is none but Christ to console and to glorify our nature.</i> It is a touching reflection, that this picture was left unfinished by the painter, and carried in his funeral procession. <h2><u><b>1.</u></h2> </b><i>“About an eight days after these sayings,”</i> Luke ix. 28. The one computation is inclusive, the other not ; or perhaps, from the <i>“about”</i> being inserted, the one is precise, the other roughly stated. The time of the transfiguration was probably <i>night</i>, for the following reasons. (1) St. Luke informs us that the Lord had gone up to the mount <i>to pray</i>; which He usually did at night (Luke vi. 12; xxi. 87; xxii. 89: Matt. xiv. 28, 24 al.). (2) All the circumstances connected with the glorification and accompanying appearances would thus be more prominently seen. (3) The Apostles were <i>asleep</i>, and are described, Luke, ver. 32, as <i>‘having kept awake through it.’</i> (4) They <i>did not descend till the next day</i> (Luke, ver. 37), which would be almost inexplicable had the event happened by day, but a matter of course if by night.<h3><u><b>an high mountain</u></h3></b> The situation of this mountain is uncertain. It was probably not Tabor, according to the legend; for on the top of Tabor then most likely stood a fortified town (De Wette, from Robinson). Nor is there any likelihood that it was Panium, near Caesarea Philippi, for the six days would probably be spent in journeying; and they appear immediately after to have come to Capernaum. It was most likely one of the mountains bordering the lake. St. Luke speaks of it merely as <i>“the mountain”</i> (country). Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 399, contends for Hermon: as does, though doubtingly, Dr. Thomson, The Land and the Book, p. 231. Stanley thinks that our Lord would still be in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi: and that “it is impossible to look up from the plain to the towering of Hermon, almost the only mountain which deserves the name in Palestine, and one of whose ancient titles (‘the lofty peak’) was derived from this very circumstance, and not be struck with its appropriateness to the scene.... High up on its southern slopes there must be many a point where the disciples could be taken ‘apart by themselves.’ Even the transient comparison of the celestial splendour with the snow, where alone it could be seen in Palestine, should not perhaps be wholly overlooked.” <h2><u>2.</u></h2> <b>was transfigured</b> =<i>“the fashion of his countenance was altered,”</i> Luke. In what way, is not stated; but we may conclude from what follows, by being lighted with radiance both from without and from within.<br><br><b>white as the light</b> = <i>“white and glistening,”</i> Luke; = <i>“exceeding while [as snow] so as no fuller on earth can white them,”</i> Mark. <h2><u><b>3.</u></h2> </b>There need be no question concerning the <i>manner</i> of the recognition of Moses and Elias by the disciples: it may have been intuitive and immediate. We can certainly not answer with Olshausen, that it may have arisen from subsequent information derived from our Lord, for Peter's words in the next verse preclude this. St. Luke adds, <i>“who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease, which he should accomplish in Jerusalem.” </i><h2><u><b>4.</u></h2></b> St. Luke inserts, that the Apostles <i>had been asleep,</i> but wakened through this whole occurrence ; — thereby<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yxp0W2QZGN4WmCnygBW8iHbKnzit9Epy/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

St. Luke, without mentioning the condition of time imposed on them, remarkably confirms it by saying, <i>“they told no man in those days... .”</i><h2><u>10.</u></h2> The occasion of this enquiry was, that they had just seen Elias withdrawn from their eyes, and were enjoined not to tell the vision. How <i>then</i> should this be?

Peter answered in the affirmative, probably because he had known it paid before. <h2><u><b>25, 26.</b></u></h2> The whole force of this argument depends on the fact of the payment being a <i>divine one</i>. It rests on this: ‘If the <i>sons are free,</i> then on <i>Me,</i> being the <i>Son of God,</i> has this tax no claim.’ <br><br><b>tribute</b> is here the rendering of <i>census</i>, money’ taken according to the reckoning of the <i>census</i>,<b>—</b><i>a capitation tax.</i> <br><br><b>strangers,</b> all who are not their children, those out of their family.<h2><u><b>27.</b></u></h2> In this, which has been pronounced the most difficult miracle in the Gospels, the deeper student of our Lord’s life and actions will find no difficulty. Our Lord’s words amount to this:<b>—</b>“that, notwithstanding this immunity, <i>we</i> (graciously including the Apostle in the earthly payment, and omitting the distinction between them, which was not now to be told to any), that we may not offend them, will pay what is required<b>—</b>and shall find it furnished by God’s special providence for us.” In the foreknowledge and power which this miracle implies, the Lord recalls Peter to that great confession (ch. xvi. 16), which his hasty answer to the collectors shews him to have again in part forgotten. <br><br>Of course the miracle is to be understood in its literal historic sense.

Luke ix. 46—650. <h2><u>1.</u></h2> In Mark we learn that this discourse arose out of a dispute among the disciples <i>who should be the greatest.</i> It took place soon after the last incident. Peter had returned from his fishing: see ver. 21. The dispute had taken place before, on the way to Capernaum. It had probably been caused by the mention of the Kingdom of God as at hand in ch. xvi. 19, 28, and the preference given by the Lord to the Three.

Not <i>“as this little child humbleth itself :”</i> the child was <i>naturally humble</i>: and such as the child was by nature, we are to be by choice.<h2><u>5.</u></h2> Having shewn the child as the pattern of humility, the Lord proceeds to shew the honour in which children are held in His heavenly kingdom; and not only actual, but <i>spiritual</i> children — for both are understood in the expression one such little child. The receiving in my name is the serving (Mark ix. 35) with Christian love, and as belonging to Christ (see also ch. xxv. 40). <h2><u>6.</u></h2> Here St. Mark and St. Luke insert the saying of John respecting one casting out demons in Jesus’ name, who followed not with the Apostles: which it appears gave rise to the remark in this verse. St. Luke however goes on no farther with the discourse: St. Mark inserts also our ch. x. 42. The punishment here mentioned, <i>drowning,</i> may have been practised in the sea of Galilee: see Jerome cited in my Gr. Test. De Wette however denies this, saying that it was not a Jewish punishment; but it certainly was a Roman, for Suetonius mentions it as practised by Augustus on the rapacious attendants of Caius Caesar: and on a certain Macedonian also: see as above.<h3><u>millstone</u></h3> the word implies a stone longing, to a mill <i>turned by an ass,</i> and therefore larger than the stones of a hand-mill.<h2><u>7.</u></h2> See 1 Cor. xi. 19. Stier suggests that Judas, who took offence at the an anointing in Bethany, may have been on other occasions the man by whom the offence came, and so this may have been said with special reference to him. Still its <i>general</i> import is undeniable and plain. See also Acts ii. 23. <h2><u>8.</u></h2> The connexion is — <i>‘Wilt thou avoid being the man on whom this woe is pronounced?—then cut off all occasion of offence in thyself first.’</i> The cautions following are used in a wider sense than in ch. v. 29, 30.

We must remember with what the discourse began — a contention who should be greatest among them: and the <b>little ones</b> are those who are the furthest from these ‘greatest,’ the humble and new-born babes of the spiritual kingdom. And despise must be understood of that kind of contempt which ambition for superiority would induce for those who are by weakness or humility incapacitated for such a strife. There is no doubt that <i>children are included</i> in the word <b>little ones</b>, as they are always classed with the humble and simple-minded, and their character held up for our imitation. The <i>little children</i> in the outward state of the Church are in fact the only disciples who are sure to be that in reality, which their Baptism has put upon them, and so exactly answer to the wider meaning here conveyed by the term; and those who would in afterlife enter into the kingdom must turn back, and become as these little children — as they were when they had just received the new life in Baptism. The whole discourse is in deep and constant reference to the <i>covenant with infants</i>, which was to be made and ratified by an ordinance, in the Kingdom of Heaven, just as then. <br><br>On the reason assigned in the latter part of this verse, there have been many opinions ; some of which (e.g. that given Webster and Wilkinson, ‘<b>angels</b>, their <i>spirits</i> after death :’ a meaning which the word never bore, and one respecting which our Lord would not have spoken in the present tense, with <b>always</b>) have been broached merely to evade the plain sense of the words, which is—that <i>to individuals</i> (whether invariably, or under what circumstances of minor detail, we are not informed) <i>certain angels are allotted as their especial attendants and guardians.</i> We know elsewhere from the Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testament (Ps. xxxiv. 7; xci. 11: Heb. i. 14 al.), that the angels do <i>minister about the children of God: </i>and what should forbid that in this service, a <i>prescribed order</i> and <i>appointed duty</i> should regulate their ministrations ? Nay, is it not certain by analogy that such would be the case? But this saying of our Lord assures us that such <i>is</i> the case, and that those angels whose honour is high before God are entrusted with the charge of the humble and meek,—the children in age and the children in grace. <br><br>The phrase <b>I say unto you,</b> as in Luke xv. 7, 10, is an introduction to a revelation of some previously unknown fact in the spiritual world. <br><br>Stier has some very beautiful remarks on the guardian angels, and on the present general neglect of the doctrine of angelic tutelage, which has been doubtless a reaction from the idolatrous angel-worship of the Church of Rome (see Acts xii, 15: Daniel xii. 1: in the former case we have an individual, in the latter a national guardianship). <br><br><b>behold the face, &c.</b> i.e. are in high honour before God; not perhaps <i>especially</i> so, but the meaning may be, ‘for they have angelic guardians, who always,’ &c. See Tobit xii. 15. <h2><u>11.</u></h2> The angels are the servante and messengers of the Son of Man; and they therefore (<b>for &c.</b>) are appointed to wait on these little ones whom He came to save; and who, in their utter helplessness, are especially examples of <i>that which was lost.</i> ‘Here,’ remarks Stier, ‘is Jacob’s ladder planted before our eyes: beneath are the little ones;— then their angels ;— then the Son of Man in heaven, in whom alone man is exalted above the angels, Who, as the Great Angel of the Covenant, cometh from the Presence and Bosom of the Father;— and above Him again (ver. 14) the Father Himself, and<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LXkstQD1lTepXPCSPHNeZ033ac2sxxpz/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For similar declarations see Ezek. xviii. 28; xxxiii. 11: 2 Pet. iii. 9. The inference from this verse is—‘ then whoever despises or scandalizes one of these little ones, acts in opposition to the will of your Father in Heaven.’ Observe, when the dignity of the little ones was asserted, it was <b>my</b> <i>Father</i> ; now that a motive directly acting on the conscience of the Christian is urged, it is <b>your</b> Father.<h2><u>15—20.</u></h2> OF THE METHOD OF PROCEEDING WITH AN OFFENDING BROTHER: AND OF THE POWER OF THE CHRISTIAN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH CASES. <h2><u>15.</u></h2> The connexion of this with the preceding is: Our Lord has been speaking of <b>offences</b> (<b>stumbling-blocks</b>), which subject is the ground-tone of the whole discourse. One kind is, when <i>thou sinnest against another,</i> vv. 7—14. A second kind, when <i>thy brother sins against thee.</i> The remedy for the former must be, in each individual being cautious in his own person,—that of the latter, in the exercise of brotherly love, and if that fail, the authority of the congregation, vv. 15—17. Then follows an exposition of what that authority is, vv. 18—20. <br><br>On this verse see Levit. Xix. 17,18. This direction is only in case of <i>personal offence</i> against ourselves, and then the <i>injured person</i> is to <i>seek private explanation,</i> and that by <i>going to his injurer,</i> not waiting till <i>he</i> comes to apologize.<br><br><b>hast gained,</b> in the higher sense, <b>reclaimed,</b> gained for God, see reff.: and for thyself too: “for before, thou hadst lost him, having been broken off from thy society by the offence,” Euthymius. <h2><u>16.</u></h2> The <i>first</i> attempt of brotherly love is to heal the wound, to remove the offence, <i>in secrecy</i> ; to <i>cover</i> the sin: but if this cannot be done, the <i>next</i> step is, to take two or three, still, in case of an adjustment, <i>preventing publicity ;</i> but in the other event, <i>providing sufficient legal witness.</i> See reff. and Jobn viii. 17. <br><br>Compare St. Paul’s apparent reference to these words of our Lord, 2 Cor. xiii. 1. <h2><u>17. <b>neglect to hear</b></u></h2> The original verb is a stronger word than this, implying something of <i>obduracy:</i> <b>refuse to hear.</b> <br><br><b>the church</b> (literally <b>assembly</b>), by what follows, certainly not ‘the Jewish synagogue’ (for how could vv. 18—20 be said in any sense of it?), but <b>the congregation</b> of Christians ; i.e. in early times, such as in Acts iv. 82, the one congregation,—in after times, that congregation of which thou and he are members. That it cannot mean <i>the Church as represented by her rulers,</i> appears by vv. 19, 20,— where any collection of believers is gifted with the power of deciding in such cases. Nothing could be further from the spirit of our Lord’s command than proceedings in what are oddly enough called ‘ecclesiastical’ courts.<h3><u><b>let him be, &c.</b></u></h3> ‘let him no longer be accounted as a brother, but as one of those without,’ as the Jews accounted Gentiles and Publicans.

This refers to that entire accordance of hearty faith, which could hardly have place except also in accordance with the divine will. It was apparently misunderstood by the Apostles James and John ;—see St. Mark’s account, ch. x, 36, in which they nearly repeat these words.

See Luke xvii. 3,4. It is possible that Peter may have asked this question in virtue of the power of the keys before (ch. xvi. 19) entrusted to him, to direct him in the use of them: but it seems more likely, that it was asked as in the person of any individual: that Peter wished to follow the rules just laid down, but felt a difficulty as to the limit of his exercise of forgiveness.<br><br>The Rabbinical rule was, to forgive <i>three times and no more ;</i> this they justified by Amos i. 3, &c., Job xxxiii, 29, 30 LXX, and marg. E. V. The expression ‘seven times a day’ is found Prov. xxiv. 16, in connexion with sinning and being restored: see also Levit. xxvi. 18—28.

It amounts to the same as <i>bearing the shoes</i> - for he who did the last would necessarily be also employed in loosing and taking off the sandal. But the variety is itself indicative of the independence of Matthew and Mark of one another. St. John used the two expressions at different times, and our witnesses have reported both. Stoop down is added by St. Mark, who, as we shall find, is more minute in circumstantial detail than the other Evangelists. <h2><u><b>8.</u></h2></b> Matthew and Luke add “and fire.”<h2><u><b>9—11.</u></h2></b> JESUS IS BAPTIZED BY HIM. Matt. iii.13—17. Luke iii.21,22. <h2><u><b>9.</u></h2></b> <b>From Nasareth</b> is contained here only. The words with which this account is introduced, express indefiniteness as to time. It was (Luke iii.21) <i>after all the people were baptized:</i> see note there. The commencement of this Gospel has no marks of an eye-witness: it is the <i>compendium</i> <i>of generally current accounts.</i> <h2><u><b>10.</u></h2> straightway</b> (immediately) is a favourite connecting word with Mark. St. Mark has here taken the oral account. verbatim, and applied it to Jesus, ‘He saw,’ &c.— and him must mean <i>himself:</i> otherwise es a understand <i>John</i> before saw, and take coming up as <i>pendent</i>, which is very improbable. The construction of the sentence is a remarkable testimony of the independence of Mark and Matthew even when parts of the narrative agree verbatim.

It is a more forcible word than either of these to express the mighty and cogent impulse of the Spirit. <b>Satan</b>: <i>the devil</i>, Matthew, Luke: see note, Matt. iv.1. It seems to have been permitted to the evil one to tempt our Lord <i>during the whole of the 40 days</i>, and of this we have here, as in Luke an implied assertion. The additional intensity of temptation at the <i>end</i> of that period, is expressed in Matthew by the tempter <i>coming</i> to Him — becoming visible and audible. Perhaps the <i>being with the beasts</i> may point to one form of temptation, viz. that of <i>terror</i>, which was practised on Him: — but of the <i>inward trials</i>, who may speak? There is nothing here to <i>contradict</i> the fast spoken of in Matthew and Luke, as some have maintained. Our Evangelist, Perhaps implies it in the last words of ver. 13. remarkable that those Commentators who are fondest of maintain- ing that Mark constructed his narrative out of those of Matthew and Luke, are also most keen in pointing out what they call irreconcilable differences between him and them. No apportionment of these details to the various successive parts of the temptation is given by our Evangelist. They are simply stated to have happened, commpendiously.<h2><u><b>14, 14.</u></h2></b> JESUS BEGINS HIS MINISTRY. Matt. iv. 12—17.

A recent learned Commentator believes “these minute notices... to be recorded by the Evangelist with a studied design, lest it should be supposed that, because he incorporates so much which is in St. Matthew’s gospel, he was only a copyist: and in order to shew that he did so because he knew from ocular testimony that St. Matthew’s narrative was adequate and accurate.” I mention this, to shew to what shifts the advocates of the theory of the “inter- dependence” of the Evangelists are now reduced. <br><br>Literally, <b>So that not even the parts towards the door</b> (much less the house) <b>would any longer hold them</b> (they once sufficed to hold them).<h3><u><b>preached</u></h3></b><i><b> </b></i>in the original it is in the strict imperfect sense: <b>He speaking to them the word,</b> when that which is about to be related happened.<h2><u><b>3, 4.</u></h2> </b>It would appear that Jesus was speaking to the crowd from the upper story of the house, they being assembled in the court, or perhaps (but less probably) in the street.

See the extract from Dr. Robinson, describing the Jewish house, in note on Matt. xxvi.69. <h2><u><b>7. this man thus</u></h2></b> the first word depreciates; the second exaggerates. <h2><u><b>8.</u></h2></b> The knowledge was <i>immediate</i> and <i>supernatural</i>, as is most carefully and precisely here signified. <h2><u><b>11.

Luke v.27—89. I have discussed the question of the identity of Matthew and Levi in the notes on Matthew. The three accounts are in matter nearly identical, and in diction so minutely and unaccountably varied, as to declare here, as elsewhere, their independence of one another, except in having had some common source from which they have more or less deflected. These re- marks do not apply to the diversity of the names Matthew and Levi, which must be accounted for on other grounds.

St. Mark especially loves these solemn repetitions: compare ch. ix. 42 ff.

The interpretation of this narrative given by Meyer, I believe to be an entirely mistaken one. He the strict sense of ‘<i>to make a way</i>,’ and insists on the Lae sade by our narrative being, as distinguished from those in Matthew, Luke, that the disciples <i>made a way for them- selves through the wheat field, by plucking the ears of corn</i>, further maintaining, that there is no allusion <i>here</i> to their having eaten the grains of wheat, as in Matthew, Luke. But (1) the foundation on which all this is built is insecure. The same Greek expression in the LXX does undoubtedly mean ‘<i>to make one’s journey</i>.’ And (2) as to no allusion being made to their having eaten the corn, how otherwise could the ‘<i>had need</i>’ have been common to the disciples and to David. Could it be said that any <i>necessity</i> compelled them to clear the path by pulling up the overhanging stalks of corn? How otherwise could the remarkable addition in our narrative, ver. 27, at all bear upon the case? Fritzache’s rendering, ‘to mark the way by plucking ears and strewing them in it,’ is still worse. <h2><u><b>26. he</u></h2></b> emphatic,—<b>Himself</b>, taking up the cause of his disciples, and not leaving their defence to themselves.<h2><u><b>26.</u></h2></b> <b>In the days of Abiathar the high priest</b>: i.e. necessarily in the original, <b>during the high priesthood of Abiathar.</b> But in 1 Sam. xxi., from which this ac- count is taken, Ahimelech, not Abiathar, is the High Priest.

Amidst this varia- tion, we can hardly undertake to explain the difficulty in the text. In some MSS. the words are omitted; in others they are altered, to give the words strictly the sense ‘In the time of Abiathar the High Priest,’ so that the difficulty might be avoided by understanding the event to have happened in the time of (but not necessarily during the high priesthood of) Abiathar (who was afterwards) the High Priest. But supposing the reading to be so, what author would in an ordinary narrative think of designating an event thus? Who for instance would speak of the defeat of the Philistines at Ephesdammim, where Goliath fell, as happening <i>in the time of David the king</i>? Who would ever understand, ‘<i>in the time of Elisaus the prophet</i>, as importing, in matter of fact, any other period than that of the <i>prophetic course</i> of Elisha?

The description of the multitudes, and places whence they came, sets before us, more graphically than any where else in the Gospels, the composition of the audiences to which the Lord spoke, and whom He healed. The repetition of a <i>great</i> <i>multitude</i> (ver. 8) is the report of ‘one who <i>saw</i> the numbers from Tyre and Sidon coming and going. <h2><u><b>11.</u></h2></b> The unclean spirits are here spoken of in the person of those possessed by them, and the two fused together: for as it was impossible that <i>any but the spirits</i> could have <i>known</i> that He was the Son of God, so it was the material body of the possessed which fell down before Him, and <i>their</i> voice which uttered the cry: see note on Matt. viii. 82.

The omission of this, wholly inexplicable if St. Mark had had either Matthew or Luke before him, belongs to the fragmentary character of his Gospel. The common accounts of the compilation of this Gospel are most capricious and absurd. In one place, St. Mark omits a discourse—‘<i>because it was not his purpose to relate discourses;</i>’ in another he gives a discourse, omitting the occasion which led to it, as here. The <i>real fact being</i>, that the sources of St. Mark’s Gospel are generally of the <i>highest order</i>, and <i>most direct</i>, but the <i>amount of things contained</i> very scanty and discontinuous.<h2><u><b>20. again</u></h2></b> resumed from ch. ii. 2.<h2><u><b>21.</u></h2></b> Peculiar to Mark. <h3><u><b>his friends</u></h3></b> <i>those from his house:</i> <b>his relations</b>, beyond a doubt—for the sense is resumed by then in ver. 31: see reff. <b>went out</b> (perhaps from <i>Nazareth</i>,—or, answering to John ii. 12, <i>from Capernaum</i>), <b>set out:</b> see ch. v.14.

Matthew and Mark agree nearly verbatim; Matthew however writing throughout in the singular. Mark has some additions, e.g. <b>the sower soweth the word, ver. 14,—after “</b><i><b>the deceitfulness of riches,</b></i><b>” ver. 19, and the lusts of other things :—and some varia- tions, e.g. Satan</b> for St. Matthew's “<i>the wicked one,</i>” and St. Luke’s “<i>the devil.</i>”<br><br>Such matters are <i>not trifling</i>, because they shew the <i>gradual deflection of verbal expression</i> in different versions of the <i>same report</i>,—nor is the <i>general agreement</i> of St. Luke’s, which seems to be from a different hearer.<h2><u><b>16.</u></h2></b> <b>likewise</b>, after the same analogy:—carrying on a like principle of interpretation.<h2><u><b>20.</u></h2></b> Notice the concluding words of the interpretation exactly reproducing those of the parable, ver. 8, as characteristic.

By Commentators of the Straussian school. it is strangely supposed to be the same as the parable of the tares, <i>with the tares left out</i>. If so, a wonderful and most instructive parable has arisen out of the fragments of the other, in which the idea is <i>a totally different one</i>. It is, the <i>growth</i> of the once-deposited seed by the combination of its own development with the genial power of the earth, all of course under the creative hand of God, but independent of human care and anxiety during this time of growth. <h2><u><b>26.</u></h2></b> Observe <b>said</b>, without <i>unto them</i>—implying that He is now proceeding with his teaching to the <i>people:</i> compare ver. 33. <h3><u><b>a man</u></h3></b> Some difficulty has been felt about the interpretation of this <i>man</i>, as to whether it is <i>Christ</i> or <i>his ministers</i>. The former certainly seems to be excluded by <b>should sleep</b>, and <b>he knoweth not how</b>, ver. 27; and perhaps the latter by <b>putteth in the sickle</b>, ver. 29. But I believe the parable to be one taken simply from human things,—the sower being quite in the background, and the whole stress being on the SEED—its power and its development. The <i>man</i> then is just the farmer or husbandman, hardly admitting an <i>interpretation</i>, but necessary to the machinery of the parable.<br><br>Observe, that in this case it is not <i>his seed</i> as in Luke viii. 5,—and the agent is only hinted at in the most general way. If a meaning must be assigned, the best is “human agency” in general. <h2><u><b>27.</u></h2></b> <b>sleep and rise— </b>i.e<i>. employs himself other- wise—goes about his ordinary occupations.</i> The seed sown in the heart is in its growth dependent on other causes than mere human anxiety and watchfulness:—on a mysterious power implanted by God in the seed and the soil combined, the working of which is hidden from human eye.<br><br>No trouble of ours can accelerate the growth, or shorten the stages through pass. <br><br>It is the mistake of modern Methodism, for instance, to be always working at the seed, <i>taking it up to see whether it ts growing</i>, instead of leaving it to God’s own good time, and meanwhile diligently doing God’s work elsewhere: see Stier, iii. p. 12.

PREFACE ADDRESSED TO THEOPHILUS. The style of this preface is purer Greek than the contents of the Gospel, and also more labored and formal. This may be accounted for, partly because it is the composition of the Evangelist himself, and not translated from Hebrew sources like much of the rest, and partly because prefaces, especially when also dedicatory, are usually in a rounded and artificial style. 1, Much depends on the meaning of this word, as guiding, or modifying, our opinion on the relation and sources of our Gospel histories. (1) That the writers of our present Gospels exclusively cannot be meant, is evident; since, even supposing St. Luke to have seen all three Gospels, one (that of St. John) was wholly, and another (that of St. Matthew) was in greater the production of an eye-witness and minister of the word, which would leave only one for the many. (2) Apocryphal Gospels exclusively cannot be meant: for they would not be narrations concerning matters fully believed among us, nor delivered by eye- witnesses and ministers of the word, a great part of their contents being excluded by this very author from his own narra- tlon. (3) A combination of these two may be intended—e. g. of the later sort, the Gospel according to the Hebrews, of the former, that according to St. Mark, but then also how shall we make out the many? Our present apocryphal Gospels arose far later than any likely date which can be assigned to St.Lukes’ Gospel<br><br>see Introduction to Luke. (4) I believe the only probable interpretation of the words to be, that many persons, in charge of Churches, or otherwise induced, drew up, here and there, statements (narratives) of the testimony of eye-witnesses and ministers of the word (see below), so far as they themselves had been able to collect them. (I do not believe that either the Gospel of St. Matthew or that of St. Mark is to be reckoned among these; or if they are, that St. Luke had seen or used them.) That such narratives should not have come down to us, is no matter of surprise: for (1) they would be absorbed by the more complete and sanctioned accounts of our present Evangelists; and (2) Church tra- dition has preserved very few fragments of authentic information of the apostolic age. It is probable that in almost every Church where an eye-witness preached, his testimony would be taken down, and framed into some narrative, more or less complete, of the life and sayings of the Lord.This does not necessarily imply the insufficiency of such narrations, as some have imagined. The fact of that failure is indeed implied in St. Luke’s description of his own work but that, more because it possessed completeness (whereas they were fragmentary) than from any difference in kind.

The Apostles, delivered these matters orally to the Churches in their teaching (see below on ver. 4), and others drew up accounts from that catechetical instruction. It appears from this, that St. Luke was not aware of any narration drawn up by an eye-witness or minister of the word. Their account of these matters was a tradition, from which the narrations were drawn up. He can- not therefore have seen (or, having seen, not recognized as such, which is highly improbable) the Gospel of St. Matthew. Compare 1 John i. 1—3. Not, from the very beginning, i.e. the birth of the Lord, but from the official Beginning: see Acts 1: 21. It differs from the very first below. Eyewitnesses most probably stands alone: but it may well be taken with the word (see below). minis- ters, i. e. ministering servants but in connection with from the beginning. of the word—not, ‘the personal word’ (i. e.

St. Luke by this classes himself with these many, and shews that he intended no disparagement nor blame to them, and was going to construct his own history from similar sources. The words which follow imply however a conscious superiority of his own qualification for the work. There is here no expressed claim to inspiration, but at the same time no disclaimer of it.<h3><u>having traced down</u></h3> by research, and so become accurately acquainted with. from the very first—i. e. as in ver. 5 ; as distinguished from those who only wrote of the official life of the Lord, or only fragments perhaps of that. in order, i. e, consecutively. By this word we must not understand St. Luke to lay claim to any especially chronological accuracy in writing ; which indeed is not found in his Gospel. He traced the events in order as they happened: but he may have arranged them as other considerations led him. most excellent Theophilus, It is wholly unknown who this person was. The name was a very com- mon one. The conjectures about him are endless, and entirely without value. It appears by the title given him, that he was a person of dignity, and of course, from ver. 4, he was a convert to Christianity. The idea of the name being not a proper, but a feigned one, designating ‘those who loved God’ (found as early as Epiphanius, and adopted again recently), is far-fetched and improbable. 4.Theophilus had then been orally instructed in the narratives which form the subject of this Gospel : and St. Luke’s intention in writing it is, that he might have a more accurate know- ledge of these histories. The word means literally, catechized, ‘catechetically taught.’ those sayings, not as in A.

It appears, from the allot- ment having been just mentioned, to have been the morning incense burning. Theophylact and others understand the whole as describing the entry into the Holy of<br><br>holies on the great day of Atonement, Levit. xvi.

It was during the sacrifice on the great altar that the daily burning of the incense took place: one of the two priests, whose lot it was to offer incense, brought fire from off the altar of burnt-offering to the altar of incense, and then left the other priest there alone, who, on a signal from the priest presiding at the sacrifice, kindled the incense: see Exod. xl 5, 26.

Philo says, “‘ Moses ordered the high priest to marry not only a virgin, but one of priestly descent... but the other priests were permitted to marry other than the daughters of priests.” <b>38.] </b>Her own faithful and humble assent is here given to the divine announcement which been made to her. I believe that her conception of the Lord is to be dated <i>from ‘the utterance of these words.</i> So Euthymius, and similarly Irensus, Tertullian, Athanasius, Maldonatus, Grotius. Light-foot, holding a different opinion, says,<i> “I own, that it is the general opinion, that the Virgin conceived at Nazareth, in the instant when the Angel spoke with her.”</i> She was no unconscious vessel of the divine<br><br>will, but (see ver. 45), in humility and faith, a fellow-worker with the purpose of the Father; and therefore <i><b>her own unity with that purpose was required,</b></i> and 1s here recorded. <h2><u><b>39—56.</u></h2> VISITATION OF ELISABETH BY MARY 39.]</b> The situation of Elisabeth was not before this known to Mary; and on the intelligence of it from the angel, she arose and went to congratulate her kinswoman. But before this the events related in Matt. i. 18—25 had happened. <br><br>Mary -being betrothed to Joseph, had no communications with him, except through the bridesmaids; who, on the first indications of her pregnancy, represented it to him. This would not take longer time than the ex- pression might include—possibly three or four weeks. Then happened Matt. i. 19, 20; and immediately Joseph took her home. As a betrothed virgin she could not travel: but now immediately, and perhaps for the very reason of the circumstances under which Joseph had taken her home, she visits Elisabeth — remaining with her about three months, ver. 56. So that we have, five months, during which Elisabeth hid herself, together with the sixth month, during which takes place the Annunciation, the discovery of Mary’s pregnancy, her taking home by Joseph, together with three months visit of Mary, making up together nine months, nearly her full time: see ver. 57. The words rendered <b>a city of Juda may possibly mean </b><i><b>“</b><b>the city of Juttah,”</b></i> which (Josh. xxi. 16) was given, together with Hebron | (in the hill country of Judea : ib. ver. 11), and other neighbouring cities, to the children of Aaron the priest. But it may also mean <i><b>‘</b><b>a city</b><b> of Juda;’</b></i> and this is perhaps more likely, as no place of residence is mentioned for <b>Zacharias</b> in<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 1, Part 1, Luke, Pages 365-432 missing.</h2><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UqtuYC_uEXhIHoXSIloWnELn7BwRRX3K/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

THE ETERNAL WORD OF GOD, THE SOURCE OF ALL EXISTENCE, LIFE, AND LIGHT, BECAME FLESH, DWELT AMONG US, WAS WITNESSED TO BY JOHN, REJECTED BY HIS OWN PEOPLE, BUT RECEIVED BY SOME, WHO HAD POWER GIVEN THEM TO BECOME THE SONS OF GOD. HE WAS THE PERFECTION AND END OF GOD’s REVELATION OF HIMSELF; WHICH WAS PARTIALLY MADE IN THE LAW, BUT FULLY DECLARED IN JESUS CHRIST.<h2><u><b>1—5.</u></h2> </b>THE ETERNAL PRE-EXISTENCE OF THE WORD: HIS PERSONAL DISTINCTNESS; BUT ESSENTIAL UNITY WITH GOD. His WORKING IN CREATION, AND IN THE ENLIGHTENING OF MEN, BEFORE HIS MANIFESTATION IN THE FLESH; HIS NON-APPREHENSION BY THEM.<h2><u><b>1.</u></h2></b> Before commenting on the truths here declared, it is absolutely necessary to discuss the one term on which the whole turns: viz. THE WORD. This term is used by St. John <i>without explanation</i>, as bearing a meaning well known to his readers. The enquiry concerning that meaning must therefore be conducted on <i>historical</i>, not on mere <i>grammatical </i>grounds. And the most important elements of the enquiry are, (I.) <i>the usage of speech as regards the term</i>, by St. John himself and other biblical writers: and (II.) <i>the purely historical information </i>which we possess on the <i>ideas attached to the term</i>.<br><br>(<i>a</i>) From the first consideration we find, that in other biblical authors, as well as in John, the term LOGOS, which is the original word here, is never used to signify the divine <i>Reason </i>or <i>Mind</i>; nor indeed those of any human creature. These ideas are otherwise expressed. The usual Scripture meaning of <i>Logos is speech</i>, or <i>word</i>. The <i>logos </i>of God is the <i>creative, declarative,  injunctive Word of God</i>. <br><br>(<i>b</i>) That this is also the import in our prologue, is manifest, from the evident relation which it bears to the opening of the history of creation in Genesis. “The Word” is not an <i>attribute </i>of God, but an <i>acting reality</i>, by which the Eternal and Infinite is the great first cause of the created and finite.<br><br>(<i>c</i>) Again, this “Word” is undoubtedly in our prologue, <i>personal</i>: —not an abstraction merely, nor a personification,—not the speaking word of God, once manifested in the prophets and afterwards fully declared in Christ, as Luthardt, comparing our prologue with Heb.i.1,— but a PERSON: for “<i>the Word </i><b>was with God</b>,” and “<i>the Word </i><b>became flesh</b>:” also the Word <b>was God</b>, not <i>was God’s </i>:— which certainly would be said of none but a PERSON. <br><br>(<i>d</i>) Moreover, the WORD is <i>identical with </i>JESUS CHRIST, as the pre-existing Son of God. A comparison of verses 14 and 15 will place this beyond doubt. <br><br>(<i>e</i>) And Jesus Christ is the Word of God, not because He <i>speaks the word </i>;—nor because He is the One promised or spoken of,—nor because He is the Author and source of the Word as spoken in the Scriptures, &c.,—any more than his being called <b>life </b>and <b>light </b>implies only that He is the <i>Giver </i>of life and light: but because <i>the Word dwells in and speaks from him</i>, just as the Light dwells in and shines from, and the Life<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQUoh0iK4abo-ErkyLOa6XKt7ePDdfzh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It was He who made the worlds (ver. 3) ; He, who appeared to Isaiah (Isa. vi. compare ch.xii.41); He, whose glory is manifested in His power over nature (ch.ii.11); He, by reception of whom the new birth is wrought (ch.i.12, 13); who has power over all flesh (ch. xvii. 2),—and can bestow eternal life (ibid.) ; whose very sufferings were His glory, and the glorifying of God (ch. xvii. 1 al.) ; and who, after those sufferings, resumed, and now has, the glory which He had with the Father before the world began (ch. xviii. 5, 24).<br><br>(<i>h</i>) Luthardt, in his Commentary on this Gospel, has propounded the following view of the term “Word” and its usage: “Jesus Christ is the fulness of that word of God which was fragmentarily manifested in the prophets (Heb. i. 1). But in this prologue, ‘the Word’ is not to be taken <i>as identical with </i>Jesus not yet incarnate, nor is He the subject of vv. 1 ff.” And he urges ch. x. 35, 36 (see note there, where I have discussed this) as a key text to the meaning of “the Word.”<br><br>It seems to me, that while much of his view is true and sound, that part of it will not hold which denies the identity of the pre-existent “Word” with Jesus, in the Apostle’s mind. Had he intended by the “Word” of vv. 1–4 any other than the personal Son of God, who in ver. 14 became flesh, I do not see how “<i>was with God</i>,” and “<i>was God</i>,” could be used of “the Word.” <br><br>Nor again can I consent with him to disconnect the use of “Logos” by St.John from its previous history. The reasons given in this note for believing such use, as matter of fact, to have been prepared by the Alexandrine philosophy, are no way affected by the objections which he alleges, the difference between the “ Logos” of St. John and that of Philo, and the corrupt character of the philosophy itself. <br><br>II. (<i>a</i>) We are now secondly to enquire, how it came that St. John found this term “Logos” <i>so ready made to his hands, as to require no explanation</i>. The answer to this will be found by tracing the <i>gradual personification </i>of the <i>Word</i>, or <i>Wisdom of God</i>, in the O.T. and Jewish writings.<br><br>(<i>b</i>) We find faint traces of this personification in the <i>book of Psalms</i>: see Ps. xxxiii. 4, 6; cxix. 89, 105; cvii. 20; cxlvii. 15, 18. But it was not the mere offspring of poetic diction. For the whole form and expression of the O.T. revelation was that of the <i>Word of God</i>. The Mosaic History opens with ‘<i>God said</i>, Let there be light.’ <i>Spoken</i> commands, either openly, or in visions, were the communications from God to man. It is the Word, in all the Prophets ; the Word, in the Law ; in short, the Word, in all God’s dealings with his people: see further, Isa. xl. 8; lv. 10, 11: Jer. xxiii. 29 al.<br><br>(<i>c</i>) And as the <i>Word </i>of God was the constant idea for His revelations <i>relatively to man</i>, so was the <i>Wisdom </i>of God, for those which related to His own <i>essence and attributes</i>. That this was a later form of expression than the simple recognition of the divine Word in the Mosaic and early historical books, would naturally be the case, in the unfolding of spiritual knowledge and divine contemplation. His Almightiness was first felt, before His Wisdom and moral Purity were appreciated. In the books of Job (ch. xxviii. 12 ff.) and the Proverbs (ch. viii. ix.) we find this <i>Wisdom of God </i>personified; in the latter in very plain and striking terms; and this not poetically only, but practically ; ascribing to the <i>Wisdom of God </i>all his revelation of Himself in His works of Creation and Providence. So that this <i>Wisdom </i>embraced in fact in itself the <i>Power </i>of God; and there wanted but the highest divine attribute, <i>Love</i>, to complete the idea. But this was reserved for the N.T. manifestation.<br><br>(<i>d</i>) The next evidences of the gradual personification of the <i>Wisdom of God </i>are found in the two Apocryphal Books, the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, and the Wisdom of Solomon. The first of these, <i>originally written in Hebrew</i>, belongs probably to the latter half of the second century before Christ. In ch. i. 1, Wisdom is said to be “<i>from the Lord; and with Him for ever</i>:?” and in ver. 4, “ <i>Wisdom hath been created before all things</i>.” Then in ch. xxiv. 9— 21, the same strain is continued; “He created me from the beginning before the world,” &c., and the passage concludes with these remarkable words, “<i>They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4HG7NEa7TISl3KAHex2-kCp6FrpsSBB/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 2, Page 65:</a></h3><br><i>drink me shall yet be thirsty</i>.” <br><br>In the book of the Wisdom of Solomon, dating probably about 100 before Christ, we find (in ch. vi.22—ch. ix.) a similar personification and eulogy of Wisdom. In this remarkable passage we have “ <i>Wisdom, that sitteth by Thy throne</i>” (ch. ix.4)—said to have been “<i>present when Thou madest the world</i>” (ch.ix.9)—parallelized with “<i>Thy word</i>” (ch.ix.1,2: see also ch. xvi. 12), In ch. xviii. 15, 16, the “<i>Almighty Word</i>” is set forth as an Angel coming down from heaven, and destroying the Egyptians. <br><br>It seems highly probable that the author’s monotheistic views were confused by the admixture of Platonism, and that he regarded Wisdom as a kind of soul of the world. He occasionally puts her for God, occasionally for an attribute of God. But he had not attained that near approach to a <i>personal </i>view which we shall find in the next step of our enquiry. (<i>e</i>) The large body of Jews resident in Alexandria were celebrated for their <i>gnosis</i>, or religious philosophy. The origin of this philosophy must be referred to the mixture of the Jewish religious element with the speculative philosophies of the Greeks, more especially with that of Plato, and with ideas acquired during the captivity from Oriental sources. One of these Alexandrine writers in the second century A.C. was Aristobulus, some fragments of whose works have been preserved to us. He tells us that by the “<i>voice of God</i>” we are not to understand a “<i>spoken word</i>,” but the whole working of God in the creation of the world. <br><br>But the most complete representation of the Judeo- alexandrine gnosis, or philosophic theology, has come down to us in the works of Philo, who flourished cir. A.D.40—50. It would be out of the province of a note to give a review of the system of Philo: the result only of such review will be enough. He identifies the “<i>word</i>” with the “wisdom” of God ; it is the “<i>image of God </i>;” the “<i>archetype and pattern of light, but itself like none of created things :” “the eldest of begotten things :” “the eldest son of the Father of all that are :” “ His first-begotten, the eldest angel, being as an archangel with many names</i>” (i. 427): “<i>the shadow of God, using whom as an instrument He made the world </i>:” “<i>through whom the world was constituted </i>:” “ <i>The Father which begat all gave to the Arch-angel and the eldest born, the Word, the eminent prerogative, that, standing be- tween, he might divide the made from the </i><br><br> <i>Maker; ...and He (the Word) re- Joices in the prerogative.... not being unbegotten, as God, nor begotten, as we, but intermediate between the extremes, acting as a hostage to both:” “ there are, as it seems, two temples of God; one, this world, in which also His first-begotten divine Word is High Priest :” “the viceroy of God:” “he contains and hath fulfilled all things :” “the second God, which is His Word.” </i>These instances, the number of which might be much enlarged, will serve to shew how remarkably near to the diction and import of some passages in our Gospel Philo approached in speaking of the Word. <br><br>At the same time there is a <i>wide and unmistakable difference </i>between his “Word” and that of the Apostle. He does not distinguish it from the <i>Spirit of God</i>, nor does he connect it with any Messianic ideas, though these latter were familiar to him. Besides, his views are strangely compounded of Platonism and Judaism. The “Word” seems with him to be one comprehending, or ruling, the “ powers” or “ideas” of God, which, although borrowed from Plato, he Judaically calls “<i>angels</i>,” and the “Word” their “<i>archangel</i>.” We see by this however how fixed and prepared <i>the term</i>, and many of its attributes, were in the religious philosophy of the Alexandrine Jews. <br><br>(<i>f</i>) Meanwhile the Chaldee paraphrasts of the O.T. had habitually used such expressions as ‘the glory,’ or ‘the presence,’ or ‘the word,’ of God,—in places where nothing but His own agency could be understood. ‘The latter of these —the Memra, or word of God,—is used in so strictly personal a sense, that there can be little doubt that the Paraphrasts understood by it a divine Person or Emanation. <br><br>(<i>g</i>) From these elements, the Alexandrine and Jewish views of the “Word” or “ Wisdom” of God, there appear to have arisen very early among Christians, both orthodox and heretic, formal expressions, in which these or equivalent terms were used. Of this the Apostle Paul furnishes the most eminent example. His teacher Gamaliel united in his instruction both these elements, and they are very perceptible in the writings of his pupil. But <i>we do not find in them any direct use of the term </i>“ WORD,” as <i>personally applied to the Son of God</i>. This. shews him to have spoken mainly according to the Jewish school,—among whom, as Origen states, he could find none who held “<i>that the WORD was the Son of </i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBzMVDVT7q-GD1iiwdVim6tsNh861xlm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But even there <i>we have not the </i>“Logos” <i>identified personally with the Lord Jesus Christ</i>, or indeed <i>personally spoken so at all</i>, —however near some passages may seem to approach to this usage (ch.iv. 12, 13; xi.3). <br><br>(<i>i</i>) The Alexandrine gnosis was immediately connected with Ephesus, where the Gospel of John was probably written. Apollos (Acts xviii. 24) came thither <i>from Alexandria</i>; and Cerinthus is related by Theodoret to have studied and formed his philosophic system in Egypt, before coming to Ephesus. <br><br>(<i>j</i>) These notices will serve to account for the term “Logos” being already found by St. John framed to his use; and the anti-Gnostic tendency of his writings will furnish an additional reason why he should rescue such important truths as the pre-existence and attributes of the divine “Word” from the perversions which false philosophy had begun to make of them. <br><br>(<i>k</i>) In all that has been said in this note, no insinuation has been conveyed that either the Apostle Paul, or the Writer to the Hebrews, or John, <i>adopted in any degree their TEACHING from the existing philosophies</i>. Their teaching (which is totally distinct from any of those philosophies, as will be shewn in this commentary) is that of the Holy Spirit;—and the existing philosophics, with all their follies and inadequacies, must be regarded, <i>in so far as they </i>by their terms or ideas subserved the work which the Spirit had to do by the Apostles and teachers of Christianity, as so many providential preparations of the minds of men to receive the fuller effulgence of the Truth as it is in Jesus, which shines forth in these Scriptures.<h3><u><b>In the beginning</u></h3> </b>Equivalent to “<i>before the world was</i>,” ch. xvii. 5. The expression is indefinite, and must be interpreted relatively to the matter spoken of. ‘Thus in Acts xi. 15, it is “the beginning of the Gospel:” and by the same principle of interpretation, <i>here </i>it is <b>the beginning of all things</b>, on account of “<i>all things were made by him</i>” ver. 3. <br><br>These words, if they do not <i>assert</i>, at least <i>imply</i>, the <i>eternal pre-existence </i>of the divine Word. For “<i>was in the beginning </i> is not said of an <i>act done </i>in the beginning (as in Gen. i. 1), but of a <i>state existing </i>in the beginning, and therefore without beginning itself. <br><br><b>was</b>, not equivalent to “<i>is</i>” (see “<i>I am</i>,” ch. viii. 58 al.), as Euthymius and others have supposed ; but Origen has given the true reason for the indefinite past being used,— “It would have been more strict, in speaking of God the Word, to say <b>is</b>; but seeing that he is speaking with reference to the distinction of the Incarnation, which took place at a certain time, the Evangelist uses <b>was </b>instead of <b>is</b>.” The existence of an enduring and unlimited state of being, implied in “<i>was</i>,” is contrasted with “<i>was made</i>,” or “<i>became</i>” (the word is the same) in verses 3 and 14.<h3><u><b>and the Word was with God</u></h3> ‘With</b> is here used in the sense of “chez,” abiding with. Basil remarks that St. John says “<i>with</i> God, not <i>in </i>God, that he may set before us the distinctness of Person: . . . that he may give no opening for the confusion of person.” Both the inner substantial union, and the distinct personality of the “ Word ” are here asserted. The former is distinctly repeated in the next words. <h3><u><b>and the Word was God</u></h3> </b>This is the true form of the sentence; not ‘<i>God was the Word</i>.’ This is absolutely required by the usage of the Greek language: see in my Gr. Test. But the <i>sense </i>to be conveyed here is as weighty a consideration as the form of the sentence. Had St. John intended to say, ‘ <i>God was the Word</i>,’ —what meaning could his assertion possibly have conveyed? None other than a contradiction to his last assertion, by which he had distinguished God from the Word. And not only would this be the case, but the assertion would be inconsistent with the whole historical idea of the Word, making: this term to signify merely an attribute of God, just as when it is said, “ <i>God is love</i>.” Not to mention the unprecedented inversion of subject and predicate which this would occasion; “<i>the Word</i>” <i>having been the subject before</i>, and again <i>resumed as the subject afterwards</i>. <br><br>The <i>rendering </i>of the words being then as above, their <i>meaning </i>is the next question. <b>God</b> (see the grammatical reasons in my Gr. Test.) must be taken as implying God <i>in substance and essence</i>,—not ‘the Father,’ <i>in Person</i>. It does not mean “ <i>divine</i>,” nor is it to be rendered “<i>a God </i>”—but, as in “<i>became flesh</i>,” “<i>flesh</i>” expresses that <i>state </i>into which the Divine Word entered<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj-a-92yKPmpYs75tXtde34fa894h8Gh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

So that this first verse might be connected thus: the Word was from eternity, —was with God (the Father), —and was Himself God. <h2><u><b>2.</u></h2> </b>In order to direct the mind to the difference (in unity) between this “Word” and “God,” St. John recalls the reader’s attention to the two first clauses of ver. 1, which he now combines, in order to pass on to the <i>creative work</i>, which distinctly belongs to the “Word.” Thus also this verse fixes the reference of him in ver. 3, which might otherwise, after the mention of “God,” have seemed ambiguous. <b> </b> <b>3.] All things </b>(1 Cor. viii. 6. Col. i. 16), equivalent to “<i>the world</i>,” ver. 10. This parallelism of itself refutes the Socinian interpretation of “<i>all things</i>,” “all Christian graces and virtues, ‘the whole moral world.’ But the history of the term “ Logos” forbids such an explanation entirely. For Philo says, “<i>Thou shalt find that the cause of the world is God, by whom it was made; the matter, the four elements, out of which it was composed</i>: <b>the instrument, the Word of God, through whom it was constituted:” </b>see also Col. i. 16, and Heb. i. 2. Olshausen observes, that we never read in Scripture that ‘Christ made the world;’ but ‘the Father made the world <i>through </i>the Son,’ or ‘the world was made <i>by </i>the Father, and <i>through </i>the Son:’ because the Son <i>never works of Himself</i>, but always <i>as the revelation of the Father </i>; His work is the Father’s <i>will</i>, and the Father has no Will, except the Son, who is <i>all His will </i>(in whom He is well pleased). The Christian Fathers rightly therefore rejected the semi- Arian formula, ‘The Son was begotten by an act of the Father’s will;’ for He is <i>that Will Himself</i>. <h3><u><b>and without him</u></h3> </b>This addition is not merely a Hebraistic parallelism, but a distinct denial of the eternity and uncreatedness of matter as held by the Gnostics. They set <i>matter</i>, as a separate existence, over against God, and made it the origin of evil:—but St. John excludes any such notion. Nothing was mado without Him (the Word); all matter, and <i>implicitly </i>evil itself, in the deep and inscrutable purposes of creation (for it was not in the beginning, but was made), <b>was made through Him. </b><br><br>The punctuation at the end of the verse is uncertain, if we regard solely manuscript authority. Some of our MSS. set a full stop at “<i>was not any thing made</i>:” so that the sense of the words following would be, “<i>That which hath been made by (or in) him was life</i>.’ The question must however be determined by the sense of the passage, which is rendered weak, and inconsistent with analogy, by adopting this punctuation :—<i>weak</i>, because in that case we must render ‘That which hath been made by Him was life (i. e. having life), and that life was the light of men ;’ but. <i>how </i>was that life, i. e. that living creation which was made by Him, the light of men ? —<i>inconsistent with analogy</i>, for St. John’s usage of beginning a sentence with “<i>in</i>” or “<i>by</i>” and a demonstrative pron. should have its weight : compare ch. xiii. 35; xv. 8; xvi. 26: 1 John ii. 3, 4, 5; iii.

It is said to have been first adopted owing to an abuse of the passage by the Macedonian heretics, who maintained that if the exclusion (“<i>without him was not any thing made that was made</i>”) was <i>complete</i>, the Holy Spirit can also not have been without His creating power, i. e. was created by Him. But this would be refuted otherwise, for the Holy Spirit “<i>was</i>,” and “<i>was not made</i>.” <h2><u><b>4.</u></h2> In him was life</b>—compare 1 John v. 11, i. 1, 2, and ch, vi. 33. <br><br><b>life </b>is not merely ‘<i>spiritual life</i>,’ nor ‘<i>the recovery of blessedness</i>,’ —as some explain it:—the Word is the source of <i>all life </i>to the creature, not indeed ultimately, but mediately (see ch. v. 26: 1 John vy. 11). <h3><u><b>and the life was the light of men</u></h3> </b>This is not to be understood of the <i>teaching of the Incarnate Word</i>, but of the <i>enlightening and life-sustaining influence of the eternal Son of God</i>, in Whom was life. In the material world, light, the offspring of the Word of God, is the condition of life, and without it life degenerates and expires:—so also in the spiritual world that <i>life </i>which is in Him, is to the creature the very condition of all development and furtherance of the life of the spirit. All knowledge, all purity, all love, all happiness, spring up and grow from this life, which is the light to them all. <br><br>It is not “<i>light</i>,” but <i>the light </i>:—because this is <i>the only </i>true light: see ver. 9, also 1 John i. 5.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ZvhKsDIoy9S4EODtTfb_KRwoGhWf6NZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

St. John states here as <i>a general fact</i>, what he afterwards states of the appearance of the Incarnate Word to the chosen people, ver. 11. The sentences are strictly parallel. “<i>The light shineth in the darkness</i>” is parallel to “ <i>He came to his own</i>,” and “ <i>the darkness comprehended it not</i>” is parallel to “ <i>His own received him not</i>.” In the first, he is speaking of the <i>whole shining of this light over the world </i>; in the second, of its <i>historical manifestation to the Jews</i>.

The former construction can only be defended by a Rabbinical usage, by which “<i>all that cometh into the world</i>” means ‘all men.’ But it is very questionable whether St. John ever speaks thus. Certainly he does not, in any of the passages commonly cited to defend this rendering, ch. xviii. 87 (which is spoken by Christ of Himself and His Mission); xvi. 21, 28; xii. 46. And even if he had thus spoken, how harsh and how unmeaning is the sentence, however we take it ; whether with Euthymius we lay an emphasis on “was,” or with A.V. &c. supply “<i>that</i>” before it. If this latter had been intended, surely it would have been more distinctly expressed; and even when it is supplied, we have in this verse only a less forcible repetition of ver. 4. It seems then that we must join <b>coming into the world </b>with <b>the true light</b>. But even then, three ways of rendering are apparently open to us. The first of these, which is that of Socinus, takes “<i>coming into the world</i>” as meaning, ‘<i>at its coming into the world</i>?’ This however—besides the sense being inconsistent with ver. 4—leaves the opening clause without a demonstrative pronoun, as before. Then, secondly, <b>coming </b>might seem to be used in the sense in which we frequently have it, as a sort of future, ‘who was, or is, to come;’ see Matt. xi. 3; Mark x. 30 al. fr.; ch. vi. 14; xi. 27, in which last two places it is joined, as here, with “<i>into the world</i>.” But if this be adopted, the only sense will be that the true light, &c. <i>was to come</i>; i.e. <i>had not yet come</i>; which manifestly is not correct; —for it <i>had come</i>, when John gave his witness ; and the whole of these verses 6—13 relate to the time when He had appeared, and <i>come </i>to His own. We are driven then to the only legitimate rendering, which is to take <b>was coming </b>as equivalent to an imperfect, <b>came</b>:—this usage being frequent in the N. T. :—i.e. at the time when John bore this witness, the true light which lighteth every man, came—was in process of manifesting Himself, —into the world. <b>which lighteth every man </b>is a further expansion of <b>the true. 10.</u></h2> The world </b>is the created<br><br>world, into which He came (ver. 9), which was made by Him (ver. 3), which nevertheless (i e. as here represented by <i>man</i>, the only creature who “<i>knows</i>”) knew, recognized Him not. <b>and </b>is as in ver. 5. The three members of the sentence form a climax; <b>—He was in the world </b>(and therefore the world should have known Him), <b>and the world was made by Him </b>(much more then should it have known Him), <b>and the world knew Him not</b>. <b>11) </b>It is impossible to express this verse in terse and short English. In the original, the first <b>his own </b>is neuter—<i>his own things</i>, or <i>possessions</i>: the second, masculine, <i>his own people</i>. If we enquire for the sense, <b>his own things </b>here cannot well mean <i>the world</i>, or <b>his own people </b>mankind in general: it would be difficult to point out any Scripture usage to justify such a meaning. But abundance of passages bear out the meaning which makes the former His own inheritance or possession, i.e. Judea; and the latter, the Jews; compare especially the parable Matt. xxi. 33 ff. ; and Ecclus. xxiv. 7 ff. And thus <b>came </b>forms a nearer step in the approach to the declaration in ver. 14. He <i>came </i>to His own. On <b>received him not </b>see above on ver. 5. <h2><u><b>12.</u></h2> </b>The words, <b>as many as... </b>. primarily refer to the “<i>election</i>” <i>among the Jews</i>, who have just been spoken of: but also, by implication, being opposed to both <b>the world </b>and <b>his own</b>, the <i>election </i>in all the world. <b>as many as received him</b>, i.e, as many as recognized Him as that which He was—the Word of God and Light of men. <b>them gave he power] </b>The word means, not merely <i>capability</i>, —still less <i>privilege or prerogative,</i>—but <b>power </b>; involving all the actions and states needful to their so becoming, and removing all the obstacles in their way (e.g. the wrath of God, and the guilt of sin). <b>to become children of God] </b>The spiritual life owes its beginning to <i>a birth from above</i>, ch. iii. 3—7. “And this birth is owing to the Holy Spirit of God; so that this is equivalent to saying, ‘As many as received Him, to them gave He His Holy Spirit.’ And we find that it was so: see Acts x. 44, <b>children </b><i>of God </i>is a more comprehensive expression than “<i>sons of </i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ft2IVeqYUKu__Tr2VwMpJb6Su3dLpK2a/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

V. is entirely without authority), which brings out rather our <i>adoption</i>, and hope of in- heritance (Rom. viii. 14 ff.), whereas the other involves the <i>whole generation and process </i>of our life in the Spirit, as being from and of God, and consequently our <i>likeness </i>to God, walking in light as He is in light (1 John i. 5—7)—free from sin (ib. iii. 9; v.18) and death (ch. viii. 51). <b>to them that believe on his name] His name </b>is <i>His manifestation as that which He has given Himself out to be: i.e. as a Saviour from sin;</i> see Matt. i. 21, “<i>Thou shalt call his name Jesus; for He himself shall save His people from their sins</i>.” <h2><u><b>13.</u></h2> </b>The Jews grounded their claim to be children of God on their descent from Abraham. St. John here negatives any such claim, and asserts the exclusive divine birth of all who become children of God by faith. It is to be noticed that the conjunctions here are not merely disjunctive ones, which would necessitate the ranging the clauses as co-ordinate and parallel, but exclusive ones, which rise in climax from one clause to another,— ‘<i>not </i>of blood, <i>nor yet </i>of the will of the flesh, <i>nor yet </i>of the will of man, <i>but </i>of God.’ -Many Interpreters have seen in “<i>the will of man</i>” (the word in the original is that ex- pressing the <i>man </i>as distinguished from the <i>woman</i>) the male, and in “<i>the will of the flesh</i>” the female side of human concupiscence (so Augustine, Theophylact, &c.) ; or in the former the higher and more conscious, in the latter the lower and animal side (Bleek, Luthardt). But both these interpretations seem to be objectionable. <b>14.] And </b>must not be understood as giving a reason for the verse before; it is only the same copula as in vv. 1,3,4,5; sing on to a further assertion regarding the Word. <b>became flesh] </b>the most general expression of the great truth that He became <i>man</i>. He became that, of which man is in the body compounded. ‘There is no <i>reference </i>here to the doctrine of the Lord Jesus being the second Adam, as Olshausen thinks ; but although there may<h2><u>be <i>no reference </i>to it, it <i>lies at the ground </i>of this wideness of expression. The doctrine in this form may have been, as Lücke observes, alien to St. John’s habits of thought, but not <i>that which is implied in the doctrine</i>, the taking of the <i>nature of man </i>by the Eternal Word. The sim- plicity of this expression is no doubt directed against’ the Docete of the Apostle’s time, who maintained that the Word only apparently took human nature. Therefore he says, absolutely and literally <b>became </b>flesh: —see 1 John iv. 2. The word rendered “<i>dwelt</i>,” properly is <i>‘sojourned</i>,’ or <b>‘tabernacled,’ </b>in us. There is no reference to the flesh being the <i>tabernacle </i>of the Spirit ;—but the word is one technically used in Scripture to import the <i>dwelling of God among men</i>. <b>us</u></h2> </b>“men, who are flesh,” Bengel. <b>we beheld] </b>See 1 John i. 1; 2 Pet. i. 16. This is the Apostle’s testimony as such, see Acts i. 21. The mention of <b>glory </b>seems to be suggested by the word <b>tabernacled</b>, so frequently used of the divine Presence or <i>Shechinah</i>, and cognate in its very form with it. This glory was seen by the disciples, ch. ii, 11; xi. 4: also by Peter, James, and John, specially, on the mount of transfiguration : to which occasion the words “<i>as of the only-begotten from the Father</i>” seem to refer: but mainly, in the whole converse and teaching and suffering of the Lord, who was full of grace and truth, see below. On the term <b>as</b>, Chrysostom remarks that ‘it is not a word of mere likeness, or comparison, but of confirmation, and unquestionable endowment: as if he had said, We saw glory such as became, and such as was likely would be possessed by, the only begotten and genuine Son of God the King of all.” <b>only-begotten] </b>This word applied to Christ is peculiar to John, and occurs in ver. 18; ch. 16,18; 1 John iv. 9 only. In the N. T. usage it signifies the <i>only </i>son :—in the LXX, Ps. xxii. (xxi. 21 of the LXX) 20 (Heb., <i>my only one from the hand of the dog</i>), the <i>beloved</i>.

But obviously in the midst of ideas reaching so far deeper than that of regard, or love, of the Father for the Son, the word cannot be interpreted except in accordance with them. It refers to, and contrasts with, the children of God in vv. 12,13. <i>They </i>receive their divine birth by faith in Him, and through Him; but HE is the Only-begotten of the Father in the higher sense, in which He is begotten the Son of God. The words <b>full of grace and truth </b>(see the note in my Gr. Test.) belong probably to the last words, <b>the only-begotten of the Father</b>, and there is no need of a parenthesis, as in A. V. <h3><u><b>grace and truth</u></h3> </b>not equivalent to “<i>true grace</i>,” which destroys the precision of the expression, and itself conveys no sense whatever ; but <i>setting out the two sides </i>of the divine manifestation in Christ, <b>—grace</b>, as the result of Love to mankind, <b>—truth </b>(see ch. xiv. 6), as the unity, purity, and light of His own Character. <b>15.] </b>The testimony of John, so important as being the fulfilment of the very object for which he was <i>sent from God</i>, is in this prologue ranged, so to speak, parallel with the assertions and testimony of the Evangelist himself. So that this verse does not interrupt the train of thought, but confirms by this important testimony the assertion “<i>the Word became flesh</i>,” shewing that John <i>bore witness to His pre-existence</i>. Then (ver. 16) the “<i>full of grace and truth</i>” is again taken up. Euthymius paraphrases: “Even if I,” says the Evangelist, “may perhaps seem to some not worthy of credit, yet before me John witnesseth to His Godhead, that John, whose name is great and celebrated among all the Jews.” <b>beareth witness</b>, <i>present</i>, for solemnity—as part of the testimony to Him, not only once given, but still sub- sisting. <b>crieth </b>(in the original, <i>perfect</i>, being, in sense, <i>present</i>, <i>‘hath cried,’ </i>so that the voice is still sounding), see ch. vii. 37: “John crieth out with confidence and joy, as becometh a great herald.” Bengel. <b>This was he of whom I spake . . .</b>] This reference to a former saying seems to shew,as indeed would appear from the announcement of his own office by the Baptist, that he had uttered <h2><u>these words in the power of the Spirit concerning Him whose forerunner he was <i>before he saw and recognized Him in the flesh. </i>Then, <i>on doing so</i>, he exclaimed, <b>This was He of whom I spake</b>, &c. This view seems to be borne out. by his own statement, ver. 33, and by the order of the narrative in Matt. iii. 11, 12, 13. <b>cometh after me</u></h2> </b>In point of <i>time</i>; not of <i>birth</i>, merely or principally, nor of <i>commencement of official life</i>: but, inasmuch as John was His <i>Forerunner</i>, on account of official <i>position</i>. <b>taketh place before me] </b>This expression, <b>taketh place</b>, represents one, in the original, very difficult to render in English. It is the same word as that rendered <i>“hath been made” </i>in ver. 8: <i>hath come to be, is constituted. </i>The A.V., <i>“is preferred,” </i>would be very suitable, setting forth the advancement to official dignity before which John’s office waned and decreased (ch. iii. 30), which took place even while John’s course was being fulfilled: but the objection to <i>‘preferred’ </i>is, its possible ambiguity: the word to <i>prefer </i>meaning to <i>esteem more highly</i>, as well as to <i>advance or promote</i>, which is the sense required here. Even Dr. Johnson has fallen into the mistake of quoting this very passage, in his Dictionary, as an instance of the sense “to love more than another.” <b>because </b>(or, <b>for</b>, but better because) <b>He </b><i>was </i>(not <i>“became” </i>or <i>“was made,” </i>but as in ver. 1) before me; i.e. ‘He <i>existed</i>, was in being, before me.’ The question raised by some, whether it is probable that the Baptist had, or expressed such views of the pre-existence of Christ, is not one for us to deal with, in the face of so direct a testimony as is given to the <i>fact</i>, here and in ch. iii, 27 ff. In all probability, the Evangelist was himself a disciple of the Baptist: and if he has given us, as compared with the other Evangelists, a fuller and somewhat differing account of his testimony to Christ, it is because his means of information were ampler than those of the other Evangelists. The questioners seem to forget that the Baptist was divinely raised up and commissioned, <i>and full of the Holy Ghost, and spoke in that power; </i>his declarations were not therefore merely conclusions<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZyvUxQ08KtBKfAw-fP0-n14AeOHF7SgX/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But it can hardly be that his testimony extends beyond ver. 15, for <b>all we </b>(in ver. 16) would bear no very definite meaning in his mouth, and the assertions in ver. 17 are alien from the character of the Baptist, belonging as they do to the more mature development of Christian doctrines. I cannot doubt that this and the following verses <i>belong to the Evangelist</i>, and are a carrying onwards of his declarations concerning the divine Word. Ver. 15 is not parenthetical, but confirmatory of ver. 14, and this verse <i>grounds itself on the fact of ver. 14, corroborated by the testimony of ver. 15,— that He dwelt among us, and that we saw His glory, full of grace and truth. </i> <b>his fulness </b>is <i>that of which He was </i><b>full</b>, ver. 14, <b>all we] </b>All who believe on Him; see ver. 12. <b>received, and . . .] </b>‘Our relation to Him has been that of récipients out of His fulness, and the thing received has been’... .<h3><u><b>grace for grace</u></h3> </b>The ancient interpretation, <i>the New Covenant instead of the Old </i>(Euthymius), is certainly wrong, for the <b>received </b>is spoken entirely of <i>the times of the Incarnate Word : </i>and besides, <i>the law </i>and <i>grace </i>are distinctly <i>opposed </i>to one another in the next verse. The preposition rendered <b>for </b>(instead of) is properly used of any thing which <i>supersedes </i>another, or occupies its place. This is in fact its ordinary usage when <i>exchange </i>is spoken of: the possession of the thing gotten succeeds to, supersedes, the posses- sion of the thing given in exchange, and I possess one thing <i>instead of </i>(or, <i>for</i>) another. ‘Thus also we have received <b>grace for grace</b>, <i>continual accessions of grace </i>; new grace coming upon and super- seding the former. 17.] The connexion of this verse with the foregoing lies in the words <b>his fulness </b>(ver. 16), and<h2><u><b>in grace and truth </b>(ver. 14). ‘We received from His fulness continual additions of grace, <i>because that fulness is not, like the law, a positive enactment, finite and circumscribed</i>, of which it could be said that it <b>was given</b>, but the <i>bringing in of grace and truth</i>, which <b>came </b>(came in, came to pass) by Jesus Christ.’ The <b>fulness </b>of Christ is set against the <i>narrowness of positive enactment </i>in the law. The distinction must not be lost sight of, nor denied, as Lücke attempts to do: for Bengel truly observes: “No philosopher places his words so accurately, and observes their minute differences, as John, especially in this chapter.” <b>18.</u></h2> </b>The connexion is: ‘Moses could not give out of the <i>fulness </i>of grace and truth, for he had no <i>immediate </i>sight of God, and no man can have: there is but One who can <i>declare </i>God, the <i>only-begotten Son</i>, who is no mere <i>man</i>, but abides in the bosom of the Father.’ The <i>sight of God </i>here meant, is not only bodily sight (though of that it is true, see Exod. xxxiii. 20: 1 Tim. vi. 16), but <i>intuitive </i>and <i>infallible knowledge</i>, which enables him who has it to declare the nature and will of God; see ch.iii. 11; vi. 46; xiv. 7. The Evangelist speaks in this verse in accordance with the sayings of the Alexandrine philosophy, whose phraseology he has adopted: <i>Who hath seen Him, that he might tell us? </i>Ecclus. xliii. 31.<h3><u><b>the only-begotten Son</u></h3> </b>A remarkable various reading, <b>the only-begotten God</b>, occurs here in many of our oldest MSS., versions, and Fathers. The evidence for and against it is given in full in my Gr. Test. (edn. 6.) It seems to have arisen from a confusion of the contracted forms of writing the words “<i>Son</i>” and “<i>God</i>” in the Greek: the former being in our ancient MSS. written TC, the latter OC.

And thus it is a <b>place</b>, not the <i>many mansions</i> that He is preparing:—<i>the place</i> as a whole, not <i>each man’s place</i> in it.<h2><u><b>3.</u></h2></b> In order to understand this,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GK80UKDjLbiPYhDN1evd9bqbSh2p6zTB/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 2, Page 194:</a></h3><br>we must bear in mind what Stier well calls the ‘perspective’ of prophecy. The <i>coming again of the Lord</i> is not one single act,— as His resurrection, or the descent of the Spirit, or His second personal advent, or the final coming to judgment; but the <i>great summary</i> of all these, the result of which shall be, His taking His people to Himself to be where He is. This coming of His is <i>begun</i> (ver.18) in His Resurrection —<i>carried</i> on (ver. 23) in the <i>spiritual life</i> (see also ch. xvi. 22 ff.), the making <i>them</i> ready for the place prepared;—<i>further advanced</i> when each by death is fetched away to be with Him (Phil. i. 23): <i>fully completed</i> at His coming in glory, when they shall for ever be with Him (1 Thess. iv. 17) in the perfected resurrection state.<h2><u><b>4.</u></h2> And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know</b>: or, as in the various reading, <b>whither I go, ye know the way</b>, i.e. “ye know the way to the place to which I am going.” They might have known, and doubtless did know in some sense; but, as Lampe remarks, “sometimes we praise a man to put him in mind of his duty.” We use thus, ‘<i>you know</i>,’ — leaving to be supplied, ‘<i>if you would give the matter thought.</i>’ <br><br><b>whither</b>, viz. <i>to the Father</i> ; <b>the way</b>,—(in our Lord’s own case, of which <i>this</i> verse treats) <i>His death</i>. <h2><u><b>5.</u></h2></b> Thomas is slow of belief and apprehension. The answer to “<i>whither goest thou?</i>” ch. xiii. 37, which Peter seems to have apprehended, was not sufficient for him; see ch. xx. 25: “for he thought,” says Euthymius, “that it was some material place to which the Lord was going, and that the road thither was of the same kind.” <h2><u><b>6.</u></h2></b> Our Lord inverts the order of Thomas’s question, and in answering it practically, <i>for them</i>, speaks of ‘the Way’ first. <i>He</i> is THE WAY; not merely the Forerunner; which would imply on our part only an outward connexion with Him as His <i>followers</i>: but <i>the way</i>, in and on which we must go, having an inner union with and in Him (see Heb. x. 20). <h3><u><b>the truth</u></h3></b> more is implied in this title, than “that He ever <i>spoke truth</i>, and what He said was sure to come to pass,” as Euthymius explains it. It is another side of the same idea of <i>the Way</i> ;—God being true, and only approached by and in truth. Christ IS THE TRUTH, in Whom only (Col. ii. 3) that Knowledge of Him is gained, which (ch. xvii. 3) is eternal life. <h3><u><b>the life</u></h3></b> not merely because “not even death shall separate you from Me,” Euthymius:—but as being THE LIFE (see ver. 19: Gal. ii. 20) of all His in Whom only they who live can come to the living Father (ch. vi. 57). <h3><u><b>no man cometh unto the Father, but by me...</u></h3></b> This plainly states <i>whither</i> He was going, and <i>the way</i> also: He was going <i>to the Father</i>: and the way was, <i>through Him- self</i>. <h2><u><b>7.</u></h2></b> See ch. viii. 19. <h3><u><b>from henceforth</u></h3></b> There is no difficulty, if we bear in mind the <b>now</b> of ch. xiii. 31. The <b>henceforth</b> is the future time, beginning with our Lord’s glorification, which was now at hand. Lücke remarks : <b>‘Henceforth</b> | is not entirely future nor entirely present, but the moment of transition, the identification of the present and future. Christ speaks here by anticipation in reference to the hour of His glorification being come’ (ii. 598). <h2><u><b>8.</u></h2></b> Philip misunderstands the words <b>ye have seen him</b> to mean ‘<i>seeing in a vision</i>,’—and intimates that <i>one such sight of God</i> would set at rest<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3ZsPh4j2Y3AZ2ML54uV2xyo7ryyrVQZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This seeing of the Father in Him, is not only seeing His bodily presence, but <i>knowing</i> Him (<b>dost thou not know me?</b>). <h2><u><b>10.</u></h2></b> See ch. x. 30, 38, and for the latter clause ch. viii. 28, where the contrast is, as here, purposely inexact in <i>diction</i>,—<i>words</i> being placed in one member and <i>works</i> in the other; and, as there, <b>works</b> and <b>words</b> are taken as correlative and co-extensive ; —all the working of the Lord Jesus being a speaking, a <i>revelation of the Father</i>. According to the probably genuine reading in the margin, it will be, <b>doeth his works</b> : they are not Mine, but His, done in and by Me: but <b>in Me</b> present and abiding, so that “he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.” <h2><u><b>11–24.</u></h2></b> <i>Jesus will make proof of His abiding union with the Father, in His union with His own</i>: and this vv. 12—14, <i>in answering prayer</i>: vv. 15—17, <i>in the sending of the Spirit</i>: vv. 18 ff., <i>as a pledge of the completion of this union in His personal return</i>. The Lord now unfolds out of these words, <b>the Father dwelleth in Me, doeth his works</b>, the great promise of the Paraclete or Comforter. <h2><u><b>11. for the very works’ sake</u></h2></b> See ch. x. 38. The object here seems to be, to fix their attention on the <i>works</i> as a plain testimony even to such as could not simply believe so deep a thing on His assertion, and one which — <b>12.]</b> should become a matter felt and known in themselves hereafter,—by virtue of their living union with Him who is gone to the Father, and become the dispenser and channel of the Spirit. ‘He who <i>believes</i> Christ speaking concerning Himself, <i>believes on</i> Christ.’ Bengel. <h3><u><b>greater works than these shall he do</u></h3></b> This word is not to be evaded (so as to mean <i>greater in number</i>), but taken in its full strict sense. And the keys to its meaning will be found ch. i. 51; v. 20. <i>The</i> works which Jesus did, His Apostles also did,—viz. raising the dead, &c.;—<i>greater works than those</i>, they did —not in <i>degree</i>, but <i>in kind</i> : <i>spiritual</i> works, under the dispensation of the Spirit, which <i>had not yet come in</i>. But they did them <i>not as separate from</i> Him: but <i>in</i> Him, and <i>by</i> Him; and so (ch. v. 21) <i>He</i> is said to do them. The work which He did by Peter’s sermon, Acts ii., was one of these <i>greater works</i>—the firstfruits of the unspeakable gift. <br><br>This union of them with and in Him is expressed here by “<i>the works that</i> <b>I</b> <i>do, shall</i> <b>he</b> <i>do</i> <i>also</i>.” ‘He has sown, we reap; and the harvest is greater than the seed-time.’ Stier. <h2><u><b>13.</u></h2></b> I have retained the period at the end of ver. 12 (many editors place a comma only and connect this verse with the word <b>because</b> in the former), because the sense remains much the same, and the style is better preserved. <br><br><b>ye shall ask</b>, viz. <i>the Father</i>: so ch. xv. 16; xvi. 23. But this does not exclude, but <i>distinctly includes</i>, prayer to Christ; so blended are these two (as the <i>seeing</i> ver. 9), that we have not “<i>that will </i><b>He</b><i> do,</i>” but, ver. 14, emphatically “<i>that will </i><b>I</b><i> do.</i>” He who prays to the Father, prays to the Son.

And besides, there is added in the original an emphatic <b>I; it is I myself that will do it</b>: shewing that the use of the first person before was emphatic. “This <b>I myself</b> already points to the glorification of Jesus.” Bengel. <h2><u><b>15.</u></h2></b> is a following out of the condition in the former verse, “<i>Tf ye shall ask any thing</i> <b>in my name</b>:” ‘That <i>way of prayer</i> is the way of <i>loving obedience</i>, in which the Spirit is ever found, and which is only trodden by His help:’— and also of the purpose stated there, “<i>that the Father may be glorified in the Son</i> :” ‘As the Father is honoured in the Son, so must the Son be honoured in you;’ —see ch. xv. 10. <h2><u><b>16.</u></h2></b> And <i>then</i> the Spirit shall proceed forth upon you. The word rendered <b>I will pray</b> betokens, probably, a manner of asking implying <i>actual presence and nearness</i>,—and is here used of the mediatorial office in Christ’s <i>ascended state</i>. <br><br><b>Comforter</b>—literally <b>Paraclete</b>. Olshausen remarks that the interpretations of this word range themselves in <i>two classes</i>, which again by no means exclude one another :—those of ‘COMFORTER,’ and those of ‘ADVOCATE.’ The etymology of the word requires the <i>latter</i> as its strict meaning, and in this strict meaning it satisfies 1 John ii. 1, “<i>we have an</i> <b>Advocate</b> (<b>Paraclete</b>, as here) <i>with the Father</i>,” but not so all the places where it is used <i>of the Holy Spirit</i>,—nor this verse, where of the Son and Spirit both. And therefore the other meaning,—<b>Comforter</b>, including as it does in its fulness (see Rom. viii. 26, where both, the <i>helping</i> and the <i>interceding</i>, are united) the <i>Advocate</i> also, has been both here and in Germany (Luther has the equivalent term) sanctioned by Christian usage as the most adequate rendering. Wicliff, from whom we have our word <b>Comforter</b>, often used ‘comfort’ for the Latin <i>confortari</i>, which means to strengthen, as e.g. Luke xxii, 43; Acts ix. 19 &c. Thus the idea of <i>help and strength </i>is conveyed by it, as well as of consolation. It was this office, of Comforter in this double sense, which Jesus had filled to His disciples while with them:—and which the Holy Spirit was to fill even more abundantly (and in a higher sense, because their state would be higher) on the removal of Jesus from them. <h2><u><b>17.</u></h2></b> This Comforter is, not ‘the true Spirit,’— but ‘THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH ;’—the Spirit <i>Who is truth</i>, 1 John v. 6,—of Whom all truth comes, and who alone leads into <i>the whole truth</i>, the truth of God, ch. xvi. 13.<h3><u><b>the world</u></h3></b> equivalent to the “<i>carnal</i>” of 1 Cor. ii. 14 (where see note), those who live according to the desires of the flesh and the mind, and have no receptivity of the things of God.<h3><u><b>beholdeth</u></h3></b> This word <b>behold</b>, when used in a spiritual sense, is sometimes equivalent to <b>know</b>: but this cannot be so here, because it is separated from <b>knoweth</b> by <b>neither</b>: ‘<i>recognizes not</i> in His operations, <i>nor knows</i> :’—<b>has neither sight nor knowledge of</b>. <h3><u><b>ye know him</u></h3></b> present, but spoken of their state as disciples opposed to the world,—and by anticipation, as before. They were even now not of the world (ch. xv. 19), and are therefore viewed in the completion of their state as opposed to it. <b>dwelleth</b> (not <i>shall</i> <i>dwell</i>) is future in <i>signification</i>, as any present assertion of that which is to be permanent must necessarily be; <b>abideth</b>, as in ch, viii, 35.

With the verb in the present, the speaking by anticipation is still stronger. <h2><u><b>18.</u></h2></b> The original word should be literally rendered, <b>orphans</b>, as indeed it is in the margin of the <b>A. V. </b> The office of the Comforter is to connect the disciples with the Father: if therefore they had Him not, they would be <i>fatherless</i>. The expression is closely connected with “little children” ch. xiii. 33, and, as Euthymius says, springs from paternal compassion. This makes our Lord’s declaration, that He was coming to them, plain, as applying to the coming by the Spirit, who is one with Christ ;—not only to the ultimate personal coming, which is but the last step of the Advent, nor only the bodily coming again to them and not to the world at the Resurrection, which was but a pledge of His lasting presence in the Spirit: see on ver. 3. The <b>coming</b> is (as there) the summary of these —the <i>great Revisitation</i>, in all its blessed progress. The absence of any connecting particle, as “<i>for</i>,” with this clause, arises from the depth of affection in the Lord’s heart. <h2><u><b>19—21.</u></h2></b> This <b>coming</b> is explained to consist in His presence among them by the life of His Resurrection, which is theirs; by (ver. 20) the witness of the Spirit in their hearts; and (ver. 21) their sanctification by the Spirit in love, and the consequent manifestation of Jesus to them.<br><br>Luthardt attempts to confine this <b>coming</b> (and the whole passage) to the last great Advent, 1 in spite of the plain sense of vv. 19, 20, relying on the analogy of Rev. xxii, 17, and saying that, on the common interpretation, the Church would have no cause to long for her Lord: and so Augustine and others. But manifestly the context is against them: and they must thus explain away many other pa: (e. g. Matt. xviii. 20). The presence Christ by the Spirit is none the less <i>real</i>, for being <i>incomplete</i>. <h2><u><b>19.</u></h2></b> The <i>immediate</i> <i>reference</i> of this, <b>ye behold me</b>, is to the forty days (see Acts x. 41)—but only as leading on to its wider and deeper reference to the spiritual life. <b>I live</b>, not “<i>I shall live</i>” —the principle of Life being immanent in Him. <b>ye shall live</b>, live in all fulness, including the most blessed sense of life,—the Life of the Spirit,—here and hereafter. <h2><u><b>20.</u></h2> At that day</b>, <i>no particular day</i> : but ‘each of these periods, as its continually increasing light breaks upon you, shall bring increased knowledge of your unity in Me with the Father, and my dwelling in you by the Spirit’ If any particular day is to be thought of, it would naturally be the Pentecost. <h2><u><b>21.</u></h2></b> <b>hath … and keepeth</b>,— “that is,” says Augustine, “<b>hath</b>, in memory, and <b>keepeth</b>, in life:” or perhaps more accurately, ‘He who <i>has</i> my commandments, as being my disciple by outward profession (not thus only: but <i>holds</i> them, by the inner possession of a living faith), and <i>keeps</i> them :’ see Luke xi. 28, And this <b>keeping</b> is more of the inner <i>will</i> to keep them, than the absolute observance, which can only follow on high degrees of spiritual advancement.<h3><u><b>I will manifest myself to him</u></h3></b> by the Holy Spirit: see ch. xvi. 14. This (as Stier observes) is <i>the highest promise which can be made to man</i> (see ver. 23), and yet it is made to <i>every man</i> who <i>has and keeps</i> the commandments of the Lord Jesus.

For (<b>and</b> meaning,—hence you may infer what I am setting forth) <b>the word which ye hear</b> (and which the world <i>keepeth not</i>, but <i>neglects</i>),—<b>is not Mine, but the Father’s</b>. On the gracious and wonderful promise of ver. 23, see Rom. viii. 15. <h2><u><b>25—31.</b></u></h2> <i>His farewell, and the parting bequest of His Love.</i><h2><u><b>25.</b></u></h2> <b>have I spoken</b> is anticipatory, referring, as “<i>I said</i>” (ver. 26), to the futures, “<i>shall teach,</i>” and “<i>shall bring to remembrance.</i>” Meyer supposes that a <i>pause</i> took place here, and the Lord looks back on what He had said to them. But this does not seem so natural.<h2><u><b>26.</b></u></h2> <b>But</b>—as if He had said, ‘I know that ye do not understand them yet: but’ &c. <h3><u><b>the Holy Ghost</b></u></h3> The Paraclete, or Comforter, is now more closely defined by this well-known Name,—and, by the words, <b>whom (which) the Father will send</b>, and the pronoun <b>He . ..</b> , designated <i>personally</i>, as One sent, and One acting on them. <h3><u><b>in my name</b></u></h3> not, ‘in My stead,’ but <b>in regard of me</b>—‘in answer to My prayer, and prayers in My name,—to those who hear My name,—and as a means of manifesting Me.’ <br><br><b>shall teach you all things</b> stands by itself, not with “<i>whatsoever I have said unto you :</i>” <b>shall teach you all things</b>,—’all that can and may be learnt by you, all that belongs to your work and life in Me.’<h3><u><b>and bring all things to your remembrance</b></u></h3> What is <i>not understood</i> is liable to be <i>forgotten</i> ;—and therefore in this word is implied the giving them a right understanding of, as well as recalling, what Jesus had said to them: see ch. ii. 22; xii. 16. <br><br><i>It is on the fulfilment of this promise to the Apostles, that their sufficiency as Witnesses of all that the Lord did and taught, and consequently</i> THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE GOSPEL NARRATIVE<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s3hkhyWiiOooUEElJX-BOuLFHBE_Mu3j/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It was customary to take leave with wishes of peace :—so 1 Sam. i, 17: Luke vii. 50: Acts xvi. 36: 1 Pet. v. 14: 3 John 15. Also, to reassure by such words; see Gen. xliii 23: Judg. vi. 23. But our Lord distinguishes <i>His</i> peace, <i>true</i> peace, ‘<i>the peace which I have and give</i>’ (see ch. xv. 11), from the mere empty word used in the world’s form of greeting. Peace (in general) He <i>leaves</i> with them ;—<i>His</i> peace He <i>gives</i> to them, over and above that other. The words, <b>as the world giveth,</b> must refer, I think, to the world’s <i>manner</i> of <i>giving</i>,—not to the unreality of the world’s peace, of which, however true, there is no direct mention here. The world can only give peace in empty formulæ, saying ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace: Jer. vi. 14 al. <h2><u><b>28.</b></u></h2> The former part of the verse gives a reason why their heart should not be <i>troubled</i> ;— then the rest of the verse removes all ground of fear, since it is an <i>exaltation</i> of Him whom they loved, which is about to happen; and therefore a ground of joy, and not of fear. <h3><u><b>my Father is greater than I</b></u></h3> And therefore the <i>going</i> of Jesus <i>to the Father</i> is an <i>advancement</i>. This word <b>greater</b>, as Luther well remarks, is not here used as referring to the <i>Nature or Essence of the Son as related to the Father</i>,—but as indicating that particular subordination to the Father in which the Lord Jesus then was,—and the cessation of the state of humiliation, and entering into His glory, which would take place on His being received up to the Father. So also Calvin: “Christ is not here comparing the Divinity of the Father with His own, nor His human nature with the divine essence of the Father, but rather His present state with the heavenly glory to which He was soon to be exalted.” And Cocceius: “The inferiority here is not to be understood as meaning, according to His human nature; for the words point to an inferiority which would be <i>laid aside, on His going to the Father</i>.” And this removes all reason for fear, as <i>they</i> will be exalted in <i>Him</i>. <br><br>The whole doctrinal controversy which has been raised on these words (especially by the Fathers against the Arians), seems not to belong to the sense of the passage. That <i>there</i> ts <i>a sense</i> in which the Father is greater than even the <i>glorified</i> Son, is beyond doubt (see especially 1 Cor. xv. 27 f.) ; but as on the one hand that concession is no concession to Arianism, because it is not in the essential being of the Son, but in His Mediatorial office, that this His inferiority consists,—so on the other hand this verse implies in itself <i>no such</i> inferiority, the discourse being of <i>another kind</i>.<h2><u><b>29.</b></u></h2> <b>I have told you</b>—viz. ‘ the prophecies of My Resurrection and Ascension,’ &c.<h3><u><b>ye may believe</b></u></h3> See ch. xiii. 19, where the words “<i>that I am He</i>” are supplied. <b>That ye may believe</b>, in the fullest sense of the word. “Not that they did not previously believe Him to be the Son of God: but then, when that was fulfilled in Him, which He had before predieted,— this their faith, which now, when he was speaking to them, was small, and, when He died, was almost extinguished, revived and flourished.” Augustine. See 1 John v. 13.<h2><u><b>30.</b></u></h2> <b>I will no more talk much with you</b> :— then, as Stier remarks, He had <i>some</i> words more to say, and was not ahout to break off at ver. 31, as some have supposed.

That they observed the forms of <i>their own law</i>, in the place and manner of the stoning, is no objection to this view. <b>the witnesses</b></u></h3> See Deut. xvii. 7, where it is enacted that the hands of the witnesses were to be first on the criminal to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. <b>they laid down their clothes</b>] They disencumbered themselves of their loose outer garments, that they might be light and unimpeded in the throwing of the stones. They laid them at Saul’s feet that he might keep them in safety. Such notices are deeply interesting, when we recollect by <i>whom</i> they were in all probability carefully inserted. See ch. xxii. 19, 20, and note on ch. xxvi. 10 :—from which it appears that Saul can certainly not have been less than <i>thirty</i> at this time. He was a member of the Sanhedrim, and soon after was despatched on an important mission with their authority. <b>59.</b>] All attempts to escape from this being a direct prayer to the Saviour are vain, as I have shewn in my Greek Testament. <b>receive my spirit</b>] The same prayer in substance had been made by our Lord on the Cross (Luke xxiii. 46) to His Father.

But this latter reason is hardly applicable, after the command of our Lord ‘When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.” Matt. x. 23. Stier refers their remaining to an intimation of the Spirit, to stay and strengthen those who were left. Mr. Humphry cites an ancient tradition, mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, and by Eusebius from the Apocryphal work called the Preaching of Peter, that the Apostles were ordered by our Lord to remain at Jerusalem twelve years. But this could not be the case, as we have Peter and John going down to Samaria, ver. 14. <b>2. devout men</b></u></h2> Whether Jews or Christians, is not certain. Ananias is so called, ch. xxii. 12, and he was a Christian. Olshausen thinks that, if they had been Christians the term <i>“brethren”</i> would have been used: but this does not seem by any means certain: we can hardly reason so minutely from the diction of one section in the narrative to that of another, especially in the case of a section so distinct and peculiar as this one. Besides, <i>“brethren”</i> in this very general sense does not occur till ch. ix. 30. Probably they were pious Jews, not yet converts, but hearers and admirers of Stephen. <b>3. made havock of</b>] The word so rendered is properly used of wild beasts or of hostile armies, devastating and ravaging. <b>4—12.</b>] PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL IN SAMARIA BY PHILIP. <b>4.</b>) So then resumes the subject dropped at the end of ver. 1, and determines this verse to be the opening of a new section, not the close of<h3><u>the former. <b>preaching the word</b></u></h3> Here first we become acquainted with the missionary language so frequent in the rest of the book: and we have the word, an abbreviated expression very familiar among Christians when the book was written, for the fuller one which must have prevailed at first, <i>“the word of God.”</i> <b>5.

As the words stand here, seeing that <i>Samaria</i> (vv. 9, 14; ch. ix. 31; xv. 3) signifies the <i>district</i>, I should be inclined to believe that Sychem is here also intended. It was a place of rising importance, and in after-times eclipsed the fame of its neighbour Samaria, which latter had been, on its presentation by Augustus to Herod the Great, re-fortified and called Sebaste. It still, however, bore the name of Samaria. <b>them</b>] The inhabitants, implied in the word <i>city</i>. <b>6. gave heed...</b>] If this place was Sychem, the narrative in John iv. will fully account for the readiness with which these people received <i>‘the proclamation of the Christ’</i> <b>7.</b>] According to the reading in the genuine text, which is too strongly upheld by manuscript authority to be rejected for the easier ordinary one, the literal rendering is as follows: <b>For in the case of many who</b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QS8UZsALRQKq57Q710PSOB4n80O-velr/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Simon</b></u></h2> Neander, in the course of some excellent remarks on this whole history (see further on ver. 14), identifies, and I believe with reason, this Simon with one mentioned as living from ten to twenty years after this by Josephus, and as having been employed by the procurator Felix to tempt Drusilla to leave her husband, and live with him. Simon is there called “a Jew, born in Cyprus, and held to be a magician.” The only difficulty seems to be, that Simon is stated by Justin Martyr, himself a Samaritan, to have been “a Samaritan, from a village called Gitton.” But it has struck me that either Justin, or perhaps more probably Josephus, may have confounded Ghittim with Chittim, i.e. Citium in Cyprus. The account in Josephus is quite in character with what we here read of Simon: not inconsistent with ver. 24, which appears to have been uttered under terror occasioned by the solemn denunciation of Peter.—Justin goes on to relate that he was worshipped as a god at Rome in the time of Claudius Caesar, on account of his magical powers, and had a statue on the island in the Tiber, inscribed ‘Simoni Deo Sancto’ (to Simon the Holy God). Singularly enough, in the year 1574, a stone was found in the Tiber (or <i>standing on the island in the year </i>1662, according to Smith’s Dictionary of Biography and Mythology), with the inscription SEMONI SANCO DEO FIDIO SACRUM, i.e. sacred to the god <i>Semo Sancus</i>, the Sabine Hereules;— which makes it probable that Justin may have been misled.—The history of Simon is full of legend and fable. He is said to have studied at Alexandria, and to have originally been, with the heresiarch Dositheus, a disciple of John the Baptist. Of Dositheus he became first the disciple, and then the<h3><u>successor. Origen makes Dositheus also a Samaritan, His own especial followers (Simoniani) had dwindled so much in the time of Origen, that he says there were at that day hardly thirty in the world. There are reports also of subsequent controversies between Simon Magus and Peter, of which the scene is laid at Caesarea. According to some, he met with his death at Rome, having, during an encounter with Peter, raised himself into the air by the aid of evil spirits, and being precipitated thence at the prayer of Peter and Paul. I saw in the church of S. Francesca Romana, in the forum, a stone with two dents in it, and this inscription: “On this stone rested the knees of S. Peter, when the demons carried Simon Magus through the air.’—The fathers generally regard him as the founder of Gnosticism: this may be in some sense true: but, from the very little authentic information we possess, it is impossible to ascertain how far be was identified with their tenets. Origen distinctly denies that his followers were Christians in any sense. <b>using sorcery</b></u></h3> viz. by exercising magic arts, such as then were very common in the East and found wide acceptance; impostors taking advantage of the very general expectation of a Deliverer at this time, to set themselves up by means of such trickeries as ‘some great ones.’ We have other examples in Elymas (ch. xiii.); Apollonius of Tyana; and somewhat later, Alexander of Abonoteichos; see these latter in Smith’s Dictionary of Biography and Mythology. <b>some great one</b>] Probably not in such definite terms as his followers later are represented by Jerome as putting into his mouth: “I am the Word of God...

But to this De Wette well replies, that we can hardly suppose the Alexandrine philosophy to have been so familiar to the mass of the people; and refers the expression to their popular belief of a <i>great angel</i>, who might, as the angels were called by the Samaritans the <i>powers of God</i>, be designated by these remarkable words. <b>11.</b></u></h2> The rendering <i>“he had bewitched them”</i> is grammatically wrong. The word rendered <i>“bewitched”</i> (which is perhaps the best translation here) is <i>“amazed”</i> in Matt. xii. 23,—<i>“ astonished”</i> in Mark v. 42, Luke xxiv. 22 &c. <b>13.</b>] “Simon saw his followers dropping off, and was himself astounded at the miracles wrought by Philip: he therefore thought it best himself also to acknowledge this superior power. He attached himself to Philip, and was baptized like the rest: but we are not, as the sequel shews, to understand that the preaching of the Gospel had made any impression on his heart, but that he accounted for what he saw in his own fashion. He was convinced, from the works which Philip did, that he was <i>in league with some powerful spirit:</i> he viewed baptism as the initiation into communion with that spirit, and expected that he should be able to make use of the higher power thus gained for his own purposes, and unite this new magical power to his own. All were baptized who professed belief in Jesus as the Messiah: there was therefore no reason for rejecting Simon,<h2><u>considering besides, that from the nature of the case he would for the time have given up his magical practices.” Neander. “It is plain,” says Calvin, “from this example of Simon, that the grace which is figured in Baptism is not conferred on all indifferently. It is a dogma of the Papists, that unless a man place the bar of mortal sin in the way, all receive, with the out- ward sign, the verity and effect of the Sacraments. Thus they attribute a magical force to the Sacraments, making them profitable without faith. But it is for us to know, that we are offered by God in the Sacraments whatever the promises annexed to them contain, and this in no empty words merely, provided we are led by faith to Christ, and seek from Him what the Sacraments promise. For though the reception of Baptism was of no profit to him, as the matter stood, yet if his conversion had followed afterwards, as some think it did, in that case its profit was not extinguished nor abolished. For it often happens that it is a long time before the Spirit of God works, and causes the Sacraments to begin to prove their efficacy.” <b>14—25.</b></u></h2> MISSION OF PETER AND JOHN TO SAMARIA. A question arises on this procedure of the Apostles:—whether it was as a matter of course, that the newly baptized should, by the laying on of hands subsequently, receive the Holy Ghost,—or whether there was in the case of these Samaritans any thing peculiar, which caused the Apostles to go down to them and perform this act. (1) The only analogous case is ch. xix. 5, 6: in using which we must observe that there it is distinctly asserted that the <i>miraculous</i> gifts of the Spirit followed the laying on of Paul’s hands; and that by the expression <i>“when Simon </i><b>saw</b><i>”</i> in ver. 18, which must be taken literally, the same is implied here. And<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pNfrLPW0gADUGCrIEmOu_to8Hq_yLV7K/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

He says that they were <i>only baptized</i> in the name of the Lord Jesus, and consequently were not yet partakers of the Spirit. But either Baptism has no virtue and grace at all; or it has whatever efficacy it possesses from the Holy Spirit. In Baptism we are washed from sins: but Paul shews that this washing is the work of the Holy Ghost (Tit. iii. 5). The water of Baptism is the symbol of Christ’s blood: but Peter says that it is the Spirit by whom we are washed in the blood of Christ. In Baptism our old man is crucified that we may be raised into newness of life (Rom. vi. 6): whence is all this but by sanctification of the Spirit? So that Baptism will have nothing left, if it be dissociated from the Spirit. Therefore it must not be denied, that the Samaritans, who had duly put on Christ in Baptism, had been also invested with the Spirit (Gal. iii. 27). And indeed Luke here speaks, not of the ordinary grace of the Spirit by which God regenerates us as sons to Himself, but of those special gifts with which it was the Lord’s will to endow some persons in the beginning of the Gospel for the furnishing of the Kingdom of Christ.” And a little after: “The Papists, in their wish to extol their fictitious Confirmation, do not hesitate to go even so far as to utter this sacrilegious diction, that those are only half Christians, on whom hands have not yet been laid. It is intolerable that they should have fixed on the Church as a perpetual law, what was a mere temporal symbol... for even they themselves are obliged to confess, that the Church was only for a time adorned with those gifts. Whence it follows that the imposition of hands which the Apostles here performed, came to an end when its effect ceased.” The English church, in retaining the rite of Confirmation, <i>has not grounded it on any institution by the Apostles</i>, but merely declared the laying on of hands on the candidates, to certify them (by this sign) of God’s favour and goodness towards them, to be <i>‘after the example of the holy Apostles.’</i> Nor is there any trace in the office, of the <i>conferring of the Holy Ghost</i> by confirmation; but a distinct recognition of the <i>former reception</i> of the Holy Spirit (at Baptism), and a prayer for the increase of His influence, proportioned to the maturer life now opening on the newly confirmed. (2) If then we have here <i>no institution of a perpetual ordinance,</i> something peculiar to the case before us must have prompted this journey. And here again we have a question: Was that moving cause in the Samaritans, or in Philip? I believe the true answer to the question will be found by combining both. Our Lord’s command (ch. i. 8) had removed all doubt as to Samaria being a legitimate field for preaching, and Samaritan converts being admissible. (So also with regard to Gentile converts,—see ch. x., notes: but, as the church at this time believed, they must be <i>circumcised</i>, which the Samaritan already were,—and <i>keep the law</i>, which after their manner the Samaritans did.) The sudden appearance, however, of a body of baptized believers in Samaria, by the agency of one who was <i>not one of the Apostles</i>,—while it would excite in them every feeling of thankfulness and joy, would require their presence and power, as Apostles, to perform their especial part as the divinely appointed Founders of the Church. Add to this, that the Samaritans appear to have been credulous, and easily moved to attach themselves to individuals, whether it were Simon, or Philip; which might make the Apostles desirous to be present in person, and examine, and strengthen their faith. Another reason may have been not without its influence: the Jewish church at Jerusalem would naturally for the most part be alienated in mind from this new body of believers. The hatred between Jews and Samaritans was excessive and unrelenting. It would therefore be in the highest degree important that it should be shewn to the church at Jerusalem, that these Samaritans, by the agency of the same Apostles, were partakers of the same visibly testified gifts of the one Spirit. The use of this argument, which was afterwards applied by Peter in the case of the Gentiles, unexpected even by himself, ch. xi. 17,—was probably no small part of the purpose of this journey to Samaria. <b>14. Peter and John</b></u></h2> Perhaps <i>two</i>, in accordance with their having been sent out two and two on their first missionary journey (Mark vi. 7): so Paul and Barnabas afterwards (ch. xiii. 2): and the same principle seems to have been adhered to even when these last separated: Paul chose Silas, Barnabas took Mark.— PETER,—because to him belonged, in this early part of the gospel, in a remarkable manner, the first establishing of the church; it was the fulfilment of the promise <i>“upon this rock I will build my church.”</i> It was he who had (in common with all the Apostles, it is true, but in this early period more<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 1, Part 2, Acts, Pages 314-449 missing.</h2><br><h1>Book: Romans</h1><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YO-NYpN_YIcmHOby5zZJo3cEiG20kckV/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

I, 1—7.</b></u></h1> ADDRESS THE EPISTLE, WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF PAUL’s CALLING TO BE AN APOSTLE OF THE GOSPEL OF THE SON OF GOD. It has been remarked by Calvin, that this whole Epistle is exquisitely and skilfully arranged, so that its great argument seems to flow out of the natural and rational progress of its ordinary thought. Beginning with the proof of his Apostleship, St. Paul thence comes to the Commendation of the Gospel:this in its turn brings on a disputation concerning faith; to which then, as if led to it by the context, he gives himself.And thus he enters on the grand subject of the whole Epistle, justification by faith, which employs him as far as the end of the fifth chapter. St. Paul in the addresses of his Epistles never uses the common Greek formula “<i>greeting</i>” (James i. 1), but always a <i>prayer for blessing</i> on those to whom he is writing. In all his Epistles (and in both those of Peter, and in the Apocalypse) this prayer is for “<i>grace and peace</i>,” except in 1 and 2 Tim., where it is for “<i>grace, mercy, and peace</i>,” as in 2 John. In Jude only we find “<i>mercy, peace, and love</i>.’—The address here differs from those of most of Paul’s Epistles, in having doctrinal clauses parenthetically inserted:—such are found also in the address of the Epistle to Titus, and (in much less degree) in that of the Epistle to the Galatians. These doctrinal clauses regard, 1. the <i>fore-announcement of the Gospel through the prophets</i> : 2. <i>the description and dignity of Him</i> who was the subject of that Gospel: 3. <i>the nature and aim of the apostolic office</i> to which Paul had been called,—including the <i>persons addressed</i> in the objects of its ministration. <h2><u><b>1. A servant of Jesus Christ</b></u></h2> So also Phil. i. 1, and Tit. i, 1 (“<i>a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>”),—but usually “<i>an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>” (or, “<i>of Christ Jesus</i>”)(2 Cor., Eph., Col., 1 Tim., 2 Tim.): “a [called] apostle of Jesus Christ” (1 Cor.),—simply “<i>an apostle</i>” (Gal.),—“<i>a prisoner of Jesus Christ</i>” (Philem.). The expression ‘servant of God” is the especial Old Test. title of Israel, and of individuals, as Moses, Joshua, David, Daniel, Job, and others, who as prophets, kings, &c., were raised up for the express work of God. <b>Servant</b> must not be rendered “ <i>slave</i>,” nor merely “ <i>pious worshipper</i> :” because the former excludes the element of freewill, while the latter does not express the entire dedication to Christ. <h3><u><b>called to be an apostle</u></h3></b> In naming himself a <i>servant of Jesus Christ</i>, he bespeaks their attention as a <i>Christian speaking to Christians </i>: he now further specifies the <i>place which he held by the special calling of God</i>; <b>called</b>, and that to the very highest office, of <b>an apostle</b>; and even more—among the Apostles, not one by original selection, but one <i>specially called</i>. “The rest of the apostles were educated by long intercourse with Jesus, and were called first to follow Him and obey Him, then put forth as Apostles.

Thus the <i>called apostle</i> had a similitude and relation to the <i>called saints</i>.” Bengel. <br><br><b>apostle</b> must not be taken here in the wider sense, of a <i>missionary</i>, as in ch. xvi. 7, but in its higher and peculiar meaning, in which the Twelve bore the title (“<i>whom he also named apostles</i>,” Luke vi. 13), and Paul (and perhaps Barnabas), and James the Lord’s brother. This title was not conferred on Paul by the separation ordered by the Holy Spirit, Acts xiii. 2, <i>but in virtue of his special call by the Lord in person</i> ; compare the expression “<i>a chosen vessel</i>” (“<i>a vessel of choice</i>”), Acts ix. 15, with “<i>Have not I chosen you twelve</i>?” John vi. 70; also compare John xiii. 18; xv. 16 Acts i. 2. “I cannot agree,” says Calvin, “with those who refer this word—<b>called</b>—to Paul’s personal eternal election of God.” <h3><u><b>separated</b></u></h3> not as in Acts xiii. 2 merely, though that was a particular application of the general truth: —but (as in Gal. i. 15) “<i>God, who separated me from my mother’s womb.</i>” “The same idea of <i>separation</i> is at the root of the word <i>Pharisee</i>: but here Paul signifies that he was separated by God, not only from among men, from among Jews, from among the disciples, but even from among teachers themselves.” Bengel. <h3><u><b>unto</b> <b>i. e. for the purpose of announcing. the gospel of God</b></u></h3> i.e. <b>the good tidings sent by</b> (not concerning) <b>God</b>. The genitive is not, as in “<i>the Gospel of the kingdom</i>,” Matt. iv. 23, Mark i. 14, one of apposition, but of <i>possession</i> or origin; <b>God’s Gospel</b>. And so, whenever the expression ‘<i>the Gospel of Christ</i>’ occurs, it is not ‘the Gospel <i>about</i> Christ,’ but <i>Christ’s Gospel</i>; that Gospel which flows out of His grace, and is His gift to men. —Thus in the very beginning of the Epistle, these two short words announce that the Gospel is <i>of God</i>,—in other words, that <i>salvation is of grace only</i>. <h2><u><b>2</b>.</u></h2> This <i>good tidings</i> is no new invention, no after-thought,—but was <i>long ago announced</i> in what God’s prophets wrote concerning His Son:—and announced by way of <i>promise</i>, so that God stood pledged to its realization. “Since the charge of bringing in novelties was brought against the Gospel, he shews that it was older than the Greeks, and long ago shadowed out in the prophets.” Chrysostom. <h2><u><b>3. concerning his Son</b></u></h2> belongs to “<i>which he had promised afore</i>,” above,—<b>which he promised beforehand</b>, &c., <b>concerning His Son</b>, i. e.‘which (good tidings) He promised beforehand, &c., <i>and indicated that it should be concerning His Son</i>.’ This is more natural than (as is done in the A. V.) to bind these words to “<i>the Gospel of God</i>,” which went before. Either meaning will suit ver. 9 equally well.—Christ, the Son of God, is the <i>great subject</i> of the good news. <h3><u><b>which was born</b></u></h3> or, <b>became</b>: not, as in A. V., “<i>was made</i>.” There is nothing in the word indicating <i>creation</i>, however true that may have been: see John i. 14. <h3><u><b>according to the flesh</b></u></h3> On the side of His humanity, our Lord became, was born; <i>that</i> nature of His begins only then, when He was “<i>made (born) of a woman</i>,” Gal.iv. 4. <br><br><b>flesh</b> is here used exactly as in John i. 14, “<i>the word became flesh</i>,” to signify <i>that whole nature, body, and soul</i>,of which the outward visible tabernacle of the FLESH is the concrete representation to our senses.— The words <b>of the seed of David</b> cast a hint back at the promise just spoken of. At the same time, in so solemn an enunciation of the dignity of the Son of God, they serve to shew that even according to the human side, His descent had been fixed in the line of him who was Israel’s anointed and greatest king.<b> </b><h2><u><b>4.</b></u></h2> The simple antithesis would have been, <i>which was born... according to the flesh, but was the Son of God according to the Spirit</i>, see 1 Tim. iii. 16.

And (2) the Apostle, dwelling here on <i>patent facts</i>,—the announcements of prophecy,—the history of the Lord’s Humanity, does not deal with the <i>essential subsistent Godhead of Christ</i>, but with <i>that manifestation of it</i> which the great fact of the Resurrection had made to men. Also (3) by amplifying the <i>Spirit</i> into <b>the Spirit of holiness</b>, he characterizes the Spirit of Christ as one of absolute holiness, i.e. as <i>divine</i>, and <i>partaking</i> of the God-<i>head</i> : see below. <h3><u><b>with power</b></u></h3> This qualifying clause belongs to <b>declared</b>,—not to the words “<i>the Son of God</i>,”—nor again is it a parallel clause to “<i>according to the Spirit of holiness</i>,” to “by the resurrection,” &c.

The rendering then is, <b>which was with power declared </b>to be the <b>Son of God</b>. <h3><u><b>declared</b></u></h3> before men. It is not the objective <i>appointment</i> of Christ as the Son of God, that is spoken of, but the subjective manifestation in men’s minds that He is so: not of Christ’s <i>being</i> what He is, but of the <i>proof</i> of that fact by His Resurrection.<h3><u><b>according to the Spirit of holiness</b></u></h3> The Spirit of holiness is not equivalent to “the <b>Holy Spirit</b> :” this epithet would be inapplicable here, for it would point out the <i>Third Person in the Blessed Trinity, whereas it is the Spirit of Christ Himself</i>, in distinction from His Flesh, which is spoken of. And this Spirit is designated by the gen. of quality, <b>of holiness</b>, to shew that it is not a human, but a divine Spirit which is attributed <i>here</i> to Christ,—a Spirit to which holiness belongs as its essence. The other interpretations certainly miss the mark, by overlooking the terms, <i>according to the flesh</i> and <i>according to the Spirit</i>, the two sides of the Person of Christ here intended to be brought out. Such are that of Theodoret : “through the might wrought in Him by means of the Holy Spirit,”— Chrysostom : “from the Spirit, by whom He gave sanctification,” &c. Calvin and Olshausen also seem to wish to include the notion of <i>sanctifying</i> in the term <b>holiness</b>, which, how ever true, is more than strictly belongs to the words. <h3><u><b>by</b></u></h3> as indicating the source, out of which the demonstration proceeds. <h3><u><b>the resurrection of the dead</b></u></h3> not, “the resurrection <i>from</i> the dead,”’—which, besides that it is not the rendering of the words of the original, would be a weakening of the strong expression of the Apostle, who takes here summarily and by anticipation the Resurrection of Jesus as being, including, involving (“<i> <b>I am</b> the Resurrection</i>,” John xi. 25) <i>the (whole) Resurrection of the dead.</i> So that we must not render as A. V. “the resurrection from the dead,” but <b>the resurrection of the dead</b>, regarded as accomplished in that of Christ. It was the full accomplishment of this, which more than any thing declared Him to be the Son of God: see John v. 25—29. Thus in these words lies wrapped up the argument of ch. vi. 4 ff. <h3><u><b>even Jesus Christ our Lord</b></u></h3> This is the place of these words in the original, and to this place they ought to be kept. For the Apostle having given this description of the Person and dignity of the Son of God, very Man and very God, now identifies this divine Person with JESUS CHRIST, the Lord and Master of Christians,—the historical object of their faith, and (see words following) the Appointer of himself to the apostolic office.<h2><u><b>5. through whom</b></u></h2> As in Gal. i. 1; 1 Cor. i. 9, designating the Lord Himself as the Agent in conferring the grace and Apostleship. <h3><u><b>we received</b></u></h3> not ‘<i>all Christians</i>, —but <i>we</i>, the Apostle himself as he not unfrequently speaks. No others need be here included in the word. <i>Those to whom he is writing</i> cannot be thus included, for they are specially contrasted with the subject of the verb <b>received</b> by the following verse. Nor can this verb <b>received</b> (not, as A. V., “<i>have received</i>”) refer to any <i>general</i> bestowal of this kind, indicating, as it must, a definite past event, viz. the reception of the Apostleship by himself. <h3><u><b>grace</b></u></h3> It is hardly to be understood, as Augustine explains, that “the Apostle has grace in common with all the faithful, but<i> Apostleship</i> not in<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXtGG6xy2BNJZqnTeWh0K9bA3JQqj3uw/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The<i> existence</i> of such a power is not hereby denied, but <i>this place</i> refers <i>solely to the office of Paul</i> as an Apostle. It was the general bestowal of <i>grace</i>, which was the condition of and introduced the special bestowal (<b>and</b>, as so often, coupling a specific portion to a whole) of <i>apostleship</i> : compare 1 Cor. xv. 10. <h3><u><b>unto</b></u></h3> i.e. <b>with a view to</b>,—‘in order to bring about.’ <h3><u><b>obedience of faith</b></u></h3> Such is the literal rendering of the words; and this ought to be kept in the translation. They may mean either, <i>obedience which is the result of faith, or, obedience, the object of which is the faith ; obedience, </i>in fact<i>, to the faith</i>, as in Acts vi. 7, “<i>a great multitude of the priests were obedient unto the faith</i>.” Understood either way, these words form an introduction to the great subject of the Epistle. <br><br><b>in order to bring about obedience of faith among all (the) nations (or, all the Gentiles</b>: the word rendered Gentiles being always the same as that meaning <i>nations</i>). The Jews do not here come into account. There is no inclusion, and at the same time no express exclusion of them: but Paul was commissioned as <i>the Apostle of the Gentiles</i>, and he here magnifies the great office entrusted to him. <h3><u><b>for his name’s sake</b></u></h3> i.e. <b>on behalf of his name</b>; ‘for His glory” “In the <i>name of Christ</i> is summed up what He had done and was, what the Christian ever bore in mind, the zeal which marked him, the name wherewith he was named.” Jowett. The words are best taken as belonging to the whole verse: as declaring the purpose for which the grace and apostleship had been received. <h2><u><b>6. among whom</b></u></h2> The whole should be taken together: <b>among whom ye also are called of Jesus Christ;</b> otherwise, with a comma at <b>also</b>, the assertion, ‘<i>among whom are ye also</i>,’ is flat and unmeaning. Some would take <b>of Jesus Christ</b> as a genitive of <i>possession</i>, because the call of believers is generally referred to the FATHER; but sometimes the SON is said to call likewise, see John v. 25; 1 Tim. i. 12;—and with <b>beloved of God </b>following so close upon it, the expression can I think hardly be taken otherwise than as <b>called by Jesus Christ</b>. <h2><u><b>7.</b></u></h2> This verse follows, in the sense, close on ver. 1. <h3><u><b>beloved of God</b>, <b>called to be saints</b></u></h3> Both these clauses refer to <i>all the Christians addressed </i>: not (as Bengel) the first to Jewish, the second to Gentile believers. No such distinction would be in place in an exordium which anticipates. the result of the Epistle—that Jew and Gentile are one in guilt, and one in Christ.<h3><u><b>from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ</b></u></h3> God is the Giver of grace and peace,—Christ the <i>Imparter</i>.<h2><u><b>8—17.</b></u></h2> <i>OPENING OF THE EPISTLE. His thankfulness for the faith of the Romans: remembrance of them in his prayers: wish to visit them: hindrances hitherto, but still earnest intention of doing so, that he may further ground them in that Gospel, of which he is not ashamed, inasmuch as it is THE POWER OF GOD TO ALL WHO BELIEVE. This leads to the announcement (in a citation from the Scripture) of one great subject of the Epistle,—viz.: JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH</i>.<h2><u><b>8.</b></u></h2> This placing himself in intimate connexion with his readers by mention of and thankfulness for their faith or Christian graces, is the constant habit of St. Paul. The three Epistles, Gal., 1 Tim., and Titus, are the only exceptions: 2 Cor. may seem to be such, but in ch.i. 3—22 we have an equivalent: see especially, vv. 6, 7.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TY1hmPdgQM642EaLAEULsab_tXpfyCxT/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is literally, First indeed... and the sentence answering to this is found at ver. 13, ‘Ye indeed are prospering in the faith: but<b> I</b> still am anxious <i>further</i> to advance that fruitfulness.’<h3><u><b>my God</b></u></h3> “See with what skill in the arrangement of terms he gives thanks. For he does not say, ‘<i>to God</i>,’ but <b>to my God</b>: which also the prophets do, appropriating to themselves that which is common to all. And what wonder, if they do? For we see God continually Himself doing the same in speaking of His servants, calling Himself, with a like appropriation, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.” Chrysostom. <h3><u><b>through Jesus Christ</b></u></h3> “He offers his sacrifice of thanksgiving as through the Great High Priest: for he who would offer a sacrifice must know that it must be offered through the hands of the High Priest.” Origen. So also Calvin, “We have here an example, how thanks are to be offered through Christ, according to the apostolic precept, Heb. xiii. 15.” Olshausen says, “This is no mere phrase, but a true expression of the deepest conviction. For only by the Spirit of Christ dwelling in men’s hearts are thanksgivings and prayer acceptable to God.” But perhaps here it is better to take the words as expressing an acknowledgment that the faith of the Romans, for which thanks were given, <i>was due to and rested on </i>the Lord Jesus Christ: see ch. vii. 25, and the rendering there.<h3><u><b>your faith</b></u></h3> “In congratulations of this kind Panl sometimes describes the whole Christian character, Col. i. 3 ff., or some portion of it, 1 Cor. i.5. And thus here he celebrates their faith, agreeably to his design, verses 12, 17.” Bengel.<h3><u><b>published</b></u></h3> De Wette notices the other side of the report, as given by the Jews at Rome, Acts xxviii. 22, to Paul himself. This <i>praise </i>was in the <i>Christian churches</i>, and brought by <i>Christian brethren</i>.<h3><u><b>throughout the whole world</b></u></h3> A popular hyperbole, common every where, and especially when speaking of general diffusion through the Roman empire, the ‘orbis terrarum.’ The praise would be heard in every city where there was a Christian church,—intercouse with the metropolis of the world being common to all.<h2><u><b>9.</b></u></h2> “A pious asseveration, concerning a thing necessary to be stated, and unknown. to men, especially to those who were unknown to the writer, and remote from him.” Bengel. There could be no other witness to his practice in his secret prayers, but God: and as the assertion of a habit. of incessantly praying for the Roman Christians, whom he had never seen, might seem to savour of an exaggerated expression of affection, he solemnly appeals to this only possible testimony. To the Eph., Phil. (see however Phil. i. 8), Col., Thess., he gives the same assurance, but without the asseveration. The thus calling God to witness is no uncommon practice with St. Paul: see references. <h3><u><b>whom I serve in my spirit</b></u></h3> The<i> serving God in his spirit</i> was a guarantee that his pro- fession was sincere, and that the oath just taken was no mere form, but a solemn and earnest appeal of his spirit. See also Phil. iii, 3, and John iv. 24. “The Apostle means that he is an intelligent true priest. of his God, not in the temple, but in his spirit,—not at the altar, but in the gospel of His Son.” Umbreit. <h3><u><b>in the gospel</b></u></h3> “The addition of these words shews the <i>kind</i> of his service.” Chrysostom. His peculiar method of service was concerned with the gospel of the Son of God. “Some take this addition, as if Paul wished to commend his service of God on account of its agreement with the commands of the Gospel, seeing that a service of God in the spirit is prescribed to us in the Gospel. But the other interpretation is far more agreeable to the sense, viz. that he renders his service to God in the preaching of the Gospel.” Calvin. See the use of the word “<i>Gospel</i>,” Phil. iv. 15. <h3><u><b>how unceasingly</b></u></h3> The words thus rendered may also mean, “that <b>without ceasing.</b>” The rendering in the text seems the better of the two.

So in Simon’s entreaty, Acts viii. 24, “<i>Pray ye to the Lord for me</i>, [in order] <i>that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me</i>,’ where the latter clause represents not the <i>contents</i> of the prayer, but the <i>end aimed</i> at by it.<h3><u><b>now at length</b></u></h3> i.e. before long:—literally, ‘<i>at last, some day or other</i>?<h3><u><b>shall have a way opened</b></u></h3> S<b>hall be allowed, prospered</b>. The rendering of the A. V., ‘<i>I might have a prosperous journey</i>, is incorrect, <br><br><b>by</b>, i.e. in the course of,<b>the will of God</b>. <h2><u><b>11. that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift</b></u></h2> That the <i>gift</i> here spoken of was no mere supernatural power of working in the Spirit, the whole context shews, as well as the meaning of the word itself in ch. v. 15, 16; vi. 23. And even if the word barely taken, could ever (1 Cor. xii. 4, 9 are no examples, see there) mean technically a <i>supernatural endowment of the Spirit</i>, yet the epithet <i>spiritual</i>, and the object of imparting this gift, <i>confirmation in the faith</i>, would here preclude that meaning. Besides, St. Paul did not value the mere bestowal of these ‘gifts’ so highly, as to make it the subject of his earnest prayers incessantly. The gift alluded to was the comfort (mutual confirmation in the faith) spoken of below. <br><br><b>spiritual</b>:—springing from the Spirit of God, and imparted to the spirit of man. <h3><u><b>to the end that ye may be established</b></u></h3> Knowing the trials to which they were exposed, and being conscious of the fulness of spiritual power for edification (2 Cor. xiii. 10) given to him, he longed to impart some of it to them, that they might be confirmed. “The Apostle does not say ‘<i>to the end that I may establish you</i>,’ for this belongs to God; see ch. xvi. 25, He is only the instrument: hence the passive.” Philippi.<h2><u><b>12.</b></u></h2> “Then since this saying seemed to assume too much to himself, see how he tempers it by what he puts after it. ‘That, they might not say, What? are we unsteady and wavering, and want thy tongue in order that we may stand firmly ? he anticipates this objection, and precludes such an answer by saying (as in ver. 12). It is as if he had said, Do not suppose that I said it, finding fault with you: it was not with this view that I spoke the words; but this is what I wished to say: Ye are undergoing many trials in being harassed by your persecutors: I therefore desired to see you that I may comfort you,—or rather not that I only may comfort you, but may myself also receive comfort from you.” Chrysostom.See the same wish expressed in differentwords ch, xv, 32, and the partial realization of it, Acts xxviii. 15. The A. V. has, <i>by the mutual faith both of you and me</i>. This is hardly the proper use of the word mutual, which should mean, <i>faith which each has in the other</i>; whereas the comfort here is to spring from the faith which each sees in the other. The rendering in the text is therefore to be preferred. <b>Faith</b> is used in the most general sense—<i>faith</i> as the necessary condition and working instrument of all Christian exhortation, comfort, and confirmation; producing these, and evidenced by them.<h2><u><b>13.

The words <b>but was hindered hitherto</b> are best as a parenthesis, The <i>reason of the hindrance</i> is given in ch. xv. 20–22: it was, <i>his scrupulous care to preach the gospel where it had not been preached before, rather than on the foundation of others</i>.<h3><u><b>some fruit</b></u></h3> The meaning is not. here ‘wages,’ or ‘result of my apostolic labour,’ for such is not the ordinary meaning of the word in the New Test., but <i>fruit borne by you</i> who have been planted to bring forth fruit to God. This fruit I should then gather and present to God ; compare the figure in ch. xv. 16: see also Phil. i. 22 and note. <h2><u><b>14.</b></u></h2> The connexion seems to be this: He wishes to have some fruit, some produce of expended labour, among the Romans as among the rest of the Gentiles. Till this was the case, he himself was a <i>debtor</i> to every such people: which situation of <i>debtor</i> he wished to change, by paying the debt and conferring a benefit, into that of one having money out at interest there, and yielding a <i>fruit</i>. The debt which he owed to all nations was (ver. 15) the obligation laid on him to preach the gospel to them: see 1 Cor. ix. 16.<h3><u><b>Greeks </b>—<b> Barbarians </b>—<b> wise </b>—<b> unwise</b></u></h3> These words must not be pressed as applying to any particular churches, or as if any one of them designated the Romans themselves,—or even as if <b>wise</b> belonged to <b>Greeks</b> and <b>unwise</b> to <b>Barbarians</b>. They are used, apparently, merely as comprehending <i>all Gentiles</i>, whether considered in regard of race or of intellect; and are placed here certainly not without a prospective reference to the universality of guilt, and need of the gospel, which he is presently about to prove existed in the Gentile world.—Notice that he does not call himself a debtor to the <i>Jews</i>—for they can hardly be included under the designation Barbarians (see Col. iii. 11). Though he had earnest desires for them (ch. ix. 1–3; x. 1), and every where preached to them first, this was not his peculiar <i>debt</i>, or bounden duty : see Gal. ii.7, where he describes himself as “<i>entrusted, put in charge, with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter with that of the circumcision</i>.”<h2><u><b>15. So . . .</b></u></h2> Having spoken of the whole obligation resting upon him, he now infers, from that, his readiness to fulfil one principal part of it, ‘I am ready to preach the Gospel, as to all Gentiles, so to you, who hold no mean place among them.’<h2><u><b>16.</b></u></h2> The words, <b>For I am not ashamed</b>, &c., seem to be suggested by the <i>position of the Romans in the world</i>. ‘Yea, to you at Rome also: for, though your city is mistress of the world, though your emperors are worshipped as present deities, though you are elated by your pomps and luxuries and victories, yet I am not ashamed of the apparently mean origin of the gospel which I am to preach ; for (and here is the transition to his great theme) it is, &c. <h3><u><b>for it is the power of God</b></u></h3> The gospel, which is the greatest example of the Power of God, he strikingly calls <i>that Power itself</i>. So in 1 Cor. i. 24 he calls Christ, <i>the Power of God</i>. But not only is the gospel the great example of divine Power; it is the <i>field of agency</i> of the power of God, working in it, and interpenetrating it throughout. In barely saying here that it is <b>the power</b> of God, the Apostle intends to convey (as also in 1 Cor. i. 24) a <i>superlative </i>sense; the <i>highest and holiest vehicle</i> of the divine Power, the power <i>by excellence</i>. “It is<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dNaPRnYYWbYCQOOuhQszgaFg0BINXVDh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And the <i>direction in which</i> this power acts in the gospel is <b>unto or towards salvation</b>—it is a<i> healing, saving power</i>: for as Chrysostom reminds us, there is a power of God <i>unto punishment</i>, and <i>unto destruction</i>, see Matt. x. 28.—But <i>to whom</i> is this gospel the power of God to save? <b>To every one that believeth</b>. The <i>universality </i>implied in <b>every one</b>, the <i>condition</i> necessitated in the qualification added, that believeth, and the <b>power of God</b> acting <b>unto salvation</b>, are the great subjects treated of in the former part of this Epistle. <i>All</i> are proved to be <i>under sin</i>, and so <i>needing God’s righteousness </i>(ch. i. 18–iii. 20), and the <i>entrance</i> into this righteousness is shewn to be <i>by fait</i>h (ch. iii. 21–v. 11). Then the <i>power of God </i>in freeing from the dominion of sin and death, and as issuing in salvation, is set forth (ch. v. 11–viii. 39). So that if the subject of the Epistle is to be stated in few words, these should be chosen: <b>the Gospel, the power of God unto salvation unto every one that believeth</b>. This expresses it better than merely ‘<i>justification by faith</i>, which is in fact only a subordinate part of the great theme,—only <i>the condition necessitated by man’s sinfulness for his entering the state of salvation</i>: whereas the argument extends <i>beyond this</i>, to the <i>death unto sin</i> and <i>life unto God</i> and <i>carrying forward of the sanctifying work of the Spirit</i>, from its first fruits even to its completion. <h3><u><b>to the Jew first, and also to the Greek</b></u></h3> This is the<i> Jewish</i> expression for all mankind, as “<i> Greeks and Barbarians</i>,” ver. 14, is the Greek one. The term <b>Greek</b> here includes <i>all Gentiles</i>. The priority here mentioned is not in order of time, but is <b>principally</b> (comp. ch. ii. 9) spoken of <i>national precedence</i>, in the sense in which the Jews were to our Lord “<i>his own</i>,” John i. 11. Salvation was “<i>from the Jews</i>,” John iv. 22. See ch. ix.5; xi. 24. Not that the Jew has any <i>preference</i> under the gospel; only he <i>inherits</i> and has a <i>precedence</i>. <h2><u><b>17.</b></u></h2> An explanation,<i> how</i> the gospel is the <i>power</i> <i>of God to salvation</i>, and how it is so <i>to the believer</i> :—because in it <b>God’s righteousness</b> (not His <i>attribute</i> of righteousness,—‘the righteousness of God,’ but righteousness <i>flowing from</i>, <i>and acceptable to Him</i>) is unfolded, and the more, the more we believe. I subjoin De Wette’s note on the words. “The Greek and Hebrew words rendered ‘<i>righteousness</i>, are taken sometimes for ‘ virtue” and ‘piety,’ which men possess or strive after,—sometimes imputatively, for ‘freedom from blame’ or ‘justification’ The latter meaning is most usual with Paul: ‘<i>righteousness</i>’ is that which is so in the sight of God (ch. ii. 13), the result of His justifying forensic Judgment, or of ‘<i>Imputation</i>’ (ch. iv. 5). It may certainly be imagined, that a man <i>might obtain </i>justification by <i>fulfilling the law</i>: in that case his righteousness is ‘<i>righteousness of his own</i>’ (ch. x. 3), a <i>righteousness springing from the law</i> (Phil. iii. 9). But it is impossible for him to obtain a ‘righteousness of his own,’ which at the same time shall avail before God (ch. iii. 20; Gal. ii. 16). The Jews not only <i>have</i> not fulfilled the law (ch. iii. 9–19), but <i>could not</i> fulfil it (vii. 7 ff.): the Gentiles likewise have rendered themselves obnoxious to the divine wrath (i. 24–32). God has ordained that the whole race should be included in disobedience. Now if man is to become righteous from being unrighteous,—this can only happen by God’s grace,—because God<i> declares him righteous</i>, assumes him to be righteous,<i> justifies</i> him (iii, 24; Gal. iii, 8):—to justify is not only negative, ‘<i>to acquit</i>,’ but also positive, ‘<i>to declare righteous</i> ;’ but never “to make righteous’ by transformation, or imparting of moral strength by which moral perfection may be attained. Justification must be taken as the old protestant dogmatists rightly took it, in a <i>forensic</i> or <i>imputative </i>sense. God justifies for Christ’s sake (ch. iii. 22 ff.) on condition of faith in Him as Mediator: the result of <i>His justification is ‘righteousness by faith</i>, and as He imparts it freely, it is ‘<i>the righteousness of God</i>,’ or <i>from God </i>(so it ought to be), Phil.iii. 9. ‘<i>The righteousness of God</i>’ is ordinarily taken for <i>that which is righteousness with God in God’s sight</i>; compare<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YBcYrz2ZXI0fzY3yphBFkklzObqfbbX2/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This justification is certainly an <i>objective </i>act of God: but it must also be <i>subjectively</i> apprehended (i. e. within him who is the subject of it), as its <i>condition</i> is subjective, i.e. dependent on such inner reception by its subject. It is <i>the acquittal from guilt, and cheerfulness of conscience, attained through faith in God’s grace in Christ</i>,—the very frame of mind which would be proper to a perfectly righteous man—if such there were,—the harmony of the spirit with God,—peace with God. All interpretations which overlook the fact of imputation are erroneous.” To say, with Jowett, that all attempts to define <i>the righteousness of God</i> are “the afterthoughts of theology, which have no real place in the interpretation of Scripture,” is in fact to shut our eyes to the great doctrinal facts of Christianity, and float off at once into uncertainty about the very foundations of the Apostle’s argument and our own faith. <h3><u><b>is revealed</b></u></h3> The verb in the original is generally used of <i>making known</i> a thing hitherto concealed: but here of that gradually more complete realization of the state of justification before God by faith in Christ, which is the continuing and increasing gift of God to the believer in the gospel. <h3><u><b>from faith</b></u></h3> “<b>from</b> points to the condition, or the subjective ground. Faith is in the sense of <i>trust</i>, and that (1) <i>a trustful assumption of a truth</i> in reference to knowledge,—which is equivalent to conviction : (2) <i>a trustful surrender of the soul, as regards the feeling.</i> Here it is especially the latter of these: that trust reposed in God’s grace in Christ, which tranquillizes the soul and frees it from all guilt,—and especially trust in the atoning death of Jesus. Bound up with this (not by the meaning of the words, but by the idea of unconditional trust, which excludes all reserve) is <i>humility</i>, consisting in the abandonment of all merits of a man’s own, and recognition of his own unworthiness and need of redemption.” De Wette.<h3><u><b>unto faith</b></u></h3> i. e. <i>to him that believes</i>. This seems the most probable interpretation, making<i> faith</i> almost equivalent to the <i>person possessing faith</i>, see ch. iii. 22: but not entirely,—it is still the aspect, the <i>phase</i>, of the man, which is receptive of the righteousness of God, and to this it is revealed. The other principal interpretation—‘<i>proceeding from faith, and leading to a higher degree of faith</i>’—does not seem so suitable or forcible. <h3><u><b>even as it is written</b></u></h3> He shews that <i>righteousness by faith is no new idea</i>, but found in the prophets. The words are cited again in Gal. iii. 11; Heb. x. 38: in the former place with the same purpose as here. They are used in Habakkuk with reference to credence given to the prophetic word: but properly speaking, <i>all faith is one</i>, in whatever word or act of God reposed: so that the Apostle is free from any charge of forcing the words to the present purpose. There are two ways of arranging them: <i>the righteous shall live by faith</i>, and <i>the righteous by faith</i>,<i> he who is righteous by faith, shall live</i>. But in fact they amount to the same: if the former, which is more agreeable to the Heb., be taken, shall live must mean, ‘shall live <i>on, endure in his</i> righteousness, <i>by means of faith</i>,’ which would assert that it was a righteousness of faith, as strongly as does the latter. Delitzsch says, “The Apostle rests no more on our text than it will bear, He only places its assertion, that the life of the just springs from his faith, in the light of the New Test.”<h1><u><b>CHAP. I, 18—XI. 36.</b></u></h1> THE DOCTRINAL EXPOSITION OF THE ABOVE TRUTH: THAT THE GOSPEL IS THE POWER OF GOD UNTO SALVATION TO EVERY ONE THAT BELIEVETH. And herein,—<i>inasmuch as this power of God consists in the revelation of God’s righteousness in man by faith, and in order to faith the first requisite is the recognition of man’s unworthiness, and incapability to work a righteousness for himself,</i>—<i>the Apostle begins by proving that ail, Gentiles and Jews, are GUILTY before God, as holding back the truth in un- righteousness</i>, ch. i. 18—iii. 20.

The necessary condition of this revelation is, the DESTRUCTION <i>of the righteousness of</i> MAN by the revelation of God’s anger against sin. <br><br><b>is revealed</b>,not <i>in the Gospel</i>: not <i>in men’s consciences: not in the miserable state of the then world</i>: but (as implied indeed by the adjunct <b>from heaven</b>,—that it is a <i>providential, universally-to-be-seen</i> revelation) in the PUNISHMENTS which, ver. 24, God, has made to follow upon sin, see also ch. ii. 2. So that revealed is said of an <i>objective reality her</i>e, not of an evangelic internal and subjective unfolding.<br><br><b>the wrath of God </b>is put, but with the deepest truth, for <i>the righteousness of God in punishment</i> (see ch. ii. 8; v. 9; Eph. ii. 3; Matt. iii, 7; John iii. 36). It is the opposite, in the divine attributes, of <i>Love</i>. <h3><u><b>ungodliness</b></u></h3> (i.e. godlessness, living without God),—and <b>unrighteousness</b> (i.e. iniquity, injustice of thought and conduct). Neither term is exclusive of the other, nor to be formally pressed to its limits. They overlap and include each other by a large margin: the specific difference being, that ungodliness is more the <i>fountain</i> (but at the same time partially the result) of<i> unrighteousness</i>,—which <i>unrighteousness </i>is more the <i>result </i>(but at the same time partially the fountain) of <i>ungodliness</i>. <b>Unrighteousness </b>is the <i>state</i> of the thoughts and feelings and habits, induced originally by forgetfulness of God, and in its turn inducing impieties of all kinds. We may notice by the way, that the word <i>ungodliness</i> forms an interesting link to the Pastoral Epistles, where it, and its opposite, <i>godliness</i>, are the ordinary terms for an unholy and a holy life. <h3><u><b>of men,who hold down (or hold back) the truth in unrighteousness</b></u></h3> who, possessing enough of the germs of religious and moral verity to preserve them from abandonment, have checked the development of this <i>truth </i>in their lives, in the love and practice of sin. That this is the meaning here is plain: see the discussion in my Greek Testament.<br><br>This meaning, ‘<i>keeping back</i>,’ ‘<i>hindering the development of</i>, admirably suits the sense, that men had (sce vv. 19 ff.) knowledge of God sufficient, if its legitimate work had been allowed, to have kept them from such excesses of enormity as they have committed, but that this <i>truth</i> they <i>held down</i>, or <i>back</i>, in unrighteousness, i.e. <i>crushed, quenched</i>, in (as the element, conditional medium) their state and practice of unrighteousness. It is plain that to take in unrighteousness for <i>unrighteously</i>, is to miss the force of the expression altogether—the pregnant ‘<i>in and by</i>’ implying that it is their unrighteousness,—the very absence of <i>righteousness </i>for which the argument contends,—which is the <i>state wherein, and the instrument whereby </i>they hold back the truth lit up in their consciences. <h2><u><b>19.</b></u></h2> because may either give the reason <i>why the anger of God is revealed</i>, and thus apply to all that follows as far as ver. 32, being taken up again at vv. 21, 24, 26, 28: or may explain the phænomena of these men holding back the truth in unrighteousness: which latter seems most probable : the words understood being, ‘(this charge I bring against them,) because.’ For he proves, first (ver. 20) that they <i>had the truth</i> ; then (vv. 21 ff.) <i>that they held it back</i>. <br><br><b>that which is known</b>, the objective knowledge patent and recognized in Creation:—not, as A. V., inconsistently with the meaning of the word in the original, ‘<i>that which may be known</i>,’ which would assert what, as simple matter of fact, was not the case, that <i>all which could be known of God</i> was manifest in them. He speaks <i>now</i> not of what they <i>might have known of God</i>, but of what they <i>did know</i>. Thus the expression will mean, <i>that universal objective knowledge of God as the Creator</i>, which we find more or less in every nation under heaven, and which, as matter of historical fact, was proved to be in possession of the great Gentile nations of antiquity. <b>is manifest in them</b>, i.e. <i>in their hearts</i>: not, <i>to them</i>,—nor, <i>among them</i>, for if it had been a thing acknowledged <i>among them</i>, it would not have been <i>held</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PXQKTuyt2WrpSD21syT0UvRsAavMElNR/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Every man has in him this know- ledge; his senses convey it to him (see next verse) with the phænomena of nature.<h3><u><b>for God manifested it unto them</b></u></h3> gives the reason why that which is known of God is manifest in them, viz. because God Himself so created the world, as to leave impressed on it this testimony to Himself.—Notice, and keep to, the <i>historic</i> <i>tense</i>: not, as A. V., ‘<i>hath manifested it</i>,’ but manifested it, viz. at the Creation. This is important for the right understanding of the words “<i>from the creation of the world</i>,” ver. 20. <h2><u><b>20.</b></u></h2> <b>For</b> (justifying the clause preceding) his invisible attributes from the time of the creation, when the manifestation was made by God, <i>are perceived</i>. <br><br><b>being understood</b> (apprehended by the mind)<b> by means of His works</b> (of creation and sustenance,—not here of moral government). The rendering of the A. V., ‘<i>being understood by the things that are made</i>, is ambiguous, being capable of conveying the sense that the things which are made, understand them. <h3><u><b>his eternal power</b></u></h3> To this the evidence of Creation is plainest of all: Eternal, and Almighty, have always been recognized epithets of the Creator.<h3><u><b>and divinity</b></u></h3> not <i>Godhead</i>: the fact that the Creator is <i>divine</i> ;—is of a <i>different nature</i> from ourselves, and accompanied by distinct attributes, and those of the highest order,—which we call <i>divine</i>. <h3><u><b>so that they are without excuse</b></u></h3> The words may be also, and more literally, rendered, <b>that they may be without excuse</b>. But, however true it is, that in the doings of the Allwise, <i>all results are purposed</i>,—the sense ‘<i>in order that they might be inexcusable</i>,’ would be<br><br>manifestly contrary to the whole spirit of the argument, which is bringing out, not at present <i>God’s sovereignty in dealing with man, but man’s inexcusableness in holding back the truth by unrighteousness</i>. Chrysostom says, “God has not done this for this express purpose, even though it has so turned out. For He did not put this knowledge of Himself forth in order to deprive them of all excuse, but in order that they might know Him: they, by forgetting Him, deprived themselves of all excuse.” <h2><u><b>21. because</b></u></h2> This assigns the reason why they were without excuse.<h3><u><b>though they knew God</b></u></h3> ie.‘<i>with the knowledge of Him above stated</i>? This testifies plainly that matter of <i>fact</i>, and not of <i>possibility</i>, has been the subject of the foregoing verses. From this point, we take up what they MIGHT HAVE DONE, <i>but</i> DID NOT. They glorified Him not as GOD, i.e. they did not by worship recognize Him as the great Creator of all, distinct from and infinitely superior to all His works. Bengel well divides <i>glorifying</i> and <i>giving of thanks</i>. “We are bound to give God thanks for benefits, but to glorify Him for His own divine attributes.” They <i>did neither</i>: in their <i>religion</i>, they deposed God from His place as Creator,—in their <i>lives</i>, they were ungrateful by the abuse of His gifts.<h3><u><b>their reasonings</b></u></h3> not, as A. V., ‘<i>imaginations</i>, which the word never signifies. It is used generally in N. T.in a bad sense: <i>they became vain</i> (idle, foolish) <b>in their speculations</b>. <h3><u><b>their heart</b></u></h3> the whole inner man,—the seat of knowledge and feeling,—<b>being without understanding </b>(especially in not retaining God in its knowledge) <b>became dark </b>(lost the little light it<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Y2DwZSuW2RDjKY4S_rJz9NjlneD5SsC/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

His Power and Majesty visible in the Creation, <b>for</b> is literally <b>in</b>, and represents the conditional element in which the change subsisted. <br><br><b>uncorruptible </b>and <b>corruptible</b> shew by contrast the folly of such a substitution: He who made and upholds all things must be <i>uncorruptible</i>, and <i>no corruptible thing can express His likeness</i>.<h3><u><b>an image of</b></u></h3> literally,<b> the similitude of the form</b>,—not of any one particular man, but <i>of man</i> (examples being abundant), to which they degraded God,—and so of the other creatures. Deities of the <i>human </i>form prevailed in Greece—those of the <i>bestial</i> in Egypt. Both methods of worship were practised in Rome. <h2><u><b>24–32.</b></u></h2> <i>Immorality, and indeed bestiality, were the sequel of idolatry.</i> <h2><u><b>24.</b></u></h2> The <b>also</b> may import, A<i>s they advanced in departure from God, so God also on His part gave them up</i>, &c.;—His dealings with<i> them </i>had a progression likewise.<h3><u><b>gave them up</b></u></h3> not merely permissive, but judicial: <b>God delivered them over</b>. As sin begets sin, and darkness of mind deeper darkness, grace gives place to judgment, and the divine wrath hardens men, and hurries them on to more fearful degrees of depravity.<h3><u><b>in the desires, or lusts</b></u></h3> not <i>by </i>nor <i>through </i>the lusts (as Erasmus and A. V.);—the lusts of the heart were the <i>field of action</i>, the department of their being, <i>in which </i>this dishonour took place.<h3><u><b>uncleanness</b></u></h3> more than mere profligacy in the satisfaction of natural lust; and see ver. 26, where a similar term, to <b>dishonour</b>, is used in the original:—bestiality, impurity in the<i> physical</i>, not only in the social and religious sense. <h3><u><b>to dishonour</b></u></h3> The infinitive mood may imply either (1) the <i>purpose</i> of God’s delivering them over to impurity, ‘<i>that their bodies should be dishonoured</i>,’ or (2) the result of that delivering over, ‘<i>so that their bodies were dishonoured</i>,’ or (3) the nature of the impurity, as below, in ver. 26,—‘<i>impurity, which consisted in their bodies being dishonoured</i>.’ The second of these seems most accordant with the usage of the Apostle and with the argument. The clause may be, and with more probability, rendered, <b>so that their bodies were dishonoured among them</b>. <h2><u><b>25.</b></u></h2> This verse casts light on the <i>holding back</i> (or <i>down</i>) <i>the truth in unrighteousness</i> of ver. 18. <i>The truth of God</i> (the true notion of Him as the Creator) which they professed, they changed into <i>a lie</i> (the word ‘<i>lie</i>’ is used of <i>idols</i>, Jer. xvi. 19), thus counteracting its legitimate agency, and depriving it of all power for good. The word rendered <b>worshipped</b> is used of the honour of <i>respect</i> and <i>observance</i> and <i>reverence</i>,—that rendered <b>served</b>, of <i>formal worship with sacrifice and offering</i>.<h3><u><b>the creature</b></u></h3> the <i>thing made</i>, a general<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d2TbbWBX32MLymlt12m3jjAPaDr7N1id/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

V.,<i> more than</i>, which would only imply that they gave to the one a <i>greater amount</i> of service than to the other.—The doxology expresses the horror of the Apostle at this dishonour, and puts their sin in a more striking light.<h2><u><b>26.</b></u></h2> literally, <b>passions of dishonour</b>: see above, ver. 24, stronger than <b>shameful passions</b>, as setting forth the condition to which the passions belonged. Contrast 1 Thess. iv. 4, “<i>to possess himself of his own vessel in honour</i>.”<h2><u><b>27.</b></u></h2> <b>in themselves, their own persons</b>, viz. by their degradation even below the beasts. <h3><u><b>the recompence</b></u></h3> The Apostle treats this degradation into which they fell, as a <i>consequence of,a retribution for</i>, their departure from God into idolatry,—with which <i>in fact </i>it was closely connected. <i>This shame</i>, and not its <i>consequences</i>, which are not <i>here </i>treated of, is the recompence of their error, their aberration from the knowledge of God, which they received. This is further shewn by the verb <b>which was meet</b>, in the past tense. If there had been no hell, nor any punishment threatened, this alone was worse than any punishment. And if <i>even in this </i>they found pleasure, why this very pleasure was an accession of punishment.<h2><u><b>28.</b></u></h2> There is, in the original, a play on words in this place, which can hardly be expressed in any other language. <b>Because they reprobated the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a reprobate mind</b>, is indeed a very inadequate, but as far as the <i>form</i> of the two words is concerned, an <i>accurate </i>representation of it. Mr. Conybeare gives it—‘‘As they thought fit to cast out the acknowledgment of God, God gave them over to an outcast mind.”<br><br><b>reprobate </b>means <i>rejected by God</i>. God withdrew from them His preventing grace, and left them to the evil which they had chosen. God did <i>not </i>give them up to a mind which had, but to a mind judicially abandoned to that depravity which, being well able to exercise the faculty of discernment required, not only does not do so, but in the headlong current of its abandonment to evil, sympathizes with and encourages (ver. 32) its practice in others. It is the seeing and approving better things, which makes the <i>following worse things </i>so peculiarly criminal.<h3><u><b>they did not choose to retain</b></u></h3> equivalent to <i>they chose not to retain</i>: the latter would express more a <i>deliberate act of the judgment</i> ending in rejection of God, whereas the text charges them with <i>not having exercised </i>that judgment which would, if exercised, have led to the retention of God in their knowledge.<h3><u><b>to retain God in their knowledge</b></u></h3> So Job xxi. 14,—”they say to God, Depart from us: for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways,” and xxii. 15–17.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7hb4gU98Vsv0ixvUWeWlErc8tTKuIFm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The Apostle can hardly have written it here, treating as he does all these immoralities of the heart and conscience as <i>results </i>of, and <i>flowing from</i>, the licentious practices of idolatry above specified.—Accurate distinctions of ethical meaning can hardly be found for all these words. Without requiring such, or insisting on each excluding the rest, I have collected the most interesting notices respecting them. <h3><u><b>unrighteousness</b></u></h3> Perhaps a general term, comprehending all that follow: such would be according to the usage of the Epistle: bunt perhaps to be confined to the stricter import of <b>injustice</b>: of which on the part of the Romans, history gives abundant testimonies. <h3><u><b>wickedness</b></u></h3> This term is interpreted to mean <i>the disposition to work evil</i>: and is used therefore more of the <i>tempter</i> and seducer to evil.<br><br><b>covetousness</b> (not as 1 Thess. iv. 6, see there), of which the whole provincial government and civil life of the Romans at the time was full. “When was the lap of avarice more widely spread?” exclaims Juvenal, soon after this.<h3><u><b>maliciousness</b></u></h3> The word thus rendered really means more the <i>passive side</i> <i>of evil</i>—the capability of and proclivity to evil,—the opposite to <i>virtue</i>. <h3><u><b>whisperer</b>s</u></h3> <b>i.e. secret maligners</b>; “backbiters” indicates <i>open slanderers</i>. The word rendered “<i>haters of God</i>,” is never found in this active sense, but always in a passive, <b>hated by God</b>; and such is apparently the sense here. The order of crimes enumerated would be broken, and one of a totally different kind inserted between<i> slanderers</i> and<i> insolent</i>, if this word is to signify ‘<i>haters of God</i>.” But on the other supposition,—if any crime was known more than another as ‘<i>hated by the gods</i>,’ it was that of informers, abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information. And the crime was one which the readers of this part of Roman history know to have been the pest of the state; Tacitus, for example, calls the informers, “persons favoured by the Prince, but hateful to God.” It does not follow that the informers<i> only</i> are intended, but the expression may be used to include all those abandoned persons who were known as <i>hated by the gods</i>, who were employed in pursuits hateful and injurious to their kind. <h3><u><b>insolent</b></u></h3> The word so rendered is opposed by the Greek writers to that indicating ‘a discreet and modest man: but here perhaps, and also as said by St. Paul of himself, 1 Tim. i. 13, it designates one who is <i>insolent</i>, ‘an insulting person.’<h3><u><b>proud</b></u></h3> The word so rendered is said to point out one who despises others in comparison with himself. Aristotle mentions insolence and pride as examples of qualities consequent on wealth. <h3><u><b>boasters</b></u></h3> “One who is rash, and claims a high character for bravery,” says Aristotle of the meaning of this word; and in another place, “the <i>boaster</i> seems to be one who appropriates credit to himself, when it does not belong to him, and greater than belongs to him . All exaggeration, and excessive depreciation, belong to the character of the boaster.” <h3><u><b>without </b>(moral) <b>understanding</b></u></h3> See Col. i. 9.<h3><u><b>without natural affection</b></u></h3> Petronius says of Rome, “In this city no one brings up children, because <b>a </b>man who has heirs<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/128Y3CA6DVO53I5WLDZznF1xi0MGr80s8/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Probably “<i>death</i>” is a general term for the<i> fatal</i> consequence of sin: that such courses <i>lead to ruin</i>. The word can hardly be pressed to its exact meaning: for many of the crimes mentioned could never be visited with judicial capital punishment in this world: nor could the heathen have any definite idea of eternal spiritual death, as the penalty attached to sin; nor again, any idea of the<i> connexion </i>between sin and natural death. “Life and Death,” remarks Umbreit, “are ever set over against one another in the Old as well as in the New Testament, the one as including all good that can befall us, the other, all evil.” The description here given by the Apostle of the moral state of the heathen world should by all means be compared with that in Thucydides, at the end of his third book, of the moral state of Greece at the end of the fourth year of the Peloponnesian war. ‘The English reader will find it in Hobbes’s Translation; and a summary of it in Grote’s History of Greece, vol. vi. ch. 50, pp. 375–384. The English historian gives only the political side of the description. There is also a remarkable passage in the Apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon, ch. xiv. 22—31, the opening of which is strikingly similar to our text.<h1><u><b>CHAP II. 1–29.</b></u></h1> <i>Secondly</i>, THE SAME, <i>that all are guilty before God</i>, IS PROVED OF THE JEWS ALSO. And first, verses 1–11,<i> no man</i> (the practice of the Jews being hinted at)<i> must condemn another, for all alike are guilty</i>. <h2><u>1.</u></h2> The address passes gradually to the Jews. They were the people who <i>judged</i>—who pronounced all Gentiles to be born in sin and under condemnation:—doubtless there were also proud and censorious men among the Gentiles, to whom the rebuke might apply, but these are hardly in the Apostle’s mind. This is evident by comparing the charge, “<i>thou that judgest does the same things</i>,” with verses 21–23, where the same charge is implied in a direct address to the Jew.<h3><u><b>Wherefore</b></u></h3> On account of this “<i>righteous judgment of God</i>,’ decreeing death against the doers of these things—FOR <i>thou doest them thyself</i>. Therefore thy setting thyself up as a judge is unjustifiable. <h3><u><b>whosoever thou art that judgest</b></u></h3> The Jew is not yet named, but hinted at. (see above): not in order to conciliate the Jews, but on account of the as yet purposely general form of the argument. This verse is in fact the major of a syllogism, the minor of which follows, verses 17–20, where the position here declared to be unjustifiable, is asserted to be assumed by <i>the Jew</i>. <h3><u><b>for wherein</b></u></h3> i.e. 'in<i> the matter in which.</i>’<h2><u><b>2. according to truth</b></u></h2> i.e. proceeds <b>according</b> to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ClG5_-AaCsOySgb1XKoxNmEnG6l3kcT-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The neglect to observe this has occasioned two mistakes: (1) an idea that by this passage it is proved that not faith only, but works also in some measure, justify before God; and (2) an idea that. by “<i>well-doing</i>” here is <i>meant</i> faith in Christ.

It is possible, in the case of the <i>suffering Christian</i>, for the former to exist without the latter: so 2 Cor. iv. 8,<i> troubled on every side, yet not distressed</i>,—where the Greek words are the same. But here the objective weight of infliction and the subjective weight of anguish, are co-existent.<h3><u><b>upon every soul of man</b></u></h3> Probably a circumlocution for the sake of emphasis and solemnity.

I, 1—3.] ADDRESS AND GREET- ING. 1.] The words <b>through the will of God</b> point probably to the depreciation of Paul’s apostolic authority at Corinth. In Gal. i. 1 we have this much more strongly asserted. But they have a refer- ence to Paul himself also: “as they point in their aspect of authority, towards the churches, so, in their aspect of a humble and earnest mind, they come from Paul himself,” says Bengel. Chrysostom, referring the words to called, says, “ Because it was His will we were called, not because we were worthy.” <b>Sosthenes</b> can hardly be assumed to be identical with the ruler of the synagogue in Acts xviii. 17: see note there. He must have been some Christian well known to the church at Corinth. Thus Paul associates with himself Silvanus and Timotheus in the Epistles to the Thessalonians: and Timo- theus in 2 Cor. Chrysostom attributes it to modesty, that he associates with himself one by far his inferior. Some have sup- posed Sosthenes to be the <i>writer </i>(i.e. the amanuensis) of the Epistle, see Rom. xvi. 22. Possibly he may have been one of the household of Chloe (ver. 11) through whom the intelligence had been received, and the Apostle may have associated him with himself as approving the appeal to apos- tolic authority. Perhaps some slight may<h2><u>have been put upon him by the parties at Corinth, and for that reason St. Paul puts him forward. our brother as 2 Cor. i. 1, of Timothy. 2.</u></h2> On the words <b>the church of God which is at Corinth</b>, Calvin remarks; “It may perhaps seem strange that he should call by the name of the Church of God that assembly of men among whom so many corruptions were rife, that Satan seemed to reign there rather than God. And it is certain that he had no design of flattering the Corinth- ians; for he speaks by the Spirit of God, who does not use flattery. Yet, among so many defilements, what kind of an appear- ance of a Church can any longer be found ? I answer, that, however many vices had crept in, however many corruptions of doc- trine and of morals, there were yet some signs of a true Church. This passage is carefully to be noted, to keep us from requiring in this world a Church without any spot or wrinkle; or refusing this title to any assembly in which all is not accord- ing to our wish. For this is a dangerous temptation, to think that there is no Church, unless where there appears per- fect purity. For whoever persuades him- self of this, will at length find it necessary to separate off from all other men, and give himself out for the only holy man in the world, or else to found a peculiar sect<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Z0R8uGrTSvXu1Rzx7lhSGqps7YRM83y/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

If we ask what cause had St. Paul to recognize the Church at Corinth? the answer is, because he saw among them the doctrine of the Gospel, Baptism, the Supper of the Lord; symbols by which the Church ought to be discerned.” On the words of God, Chrysostom remarks, “not of this man and of that man, but of God,” taking the expression as addressed to the Corinthians to remind them of their position as a congregation belonging to GOD, and <i>not to any head of a party. </i>Perhaps this is too refined, the words “<i>the Church of God</i>” being so usual with St. Paul,—see references. <b>sanctified in Christ Jesus</b></u></h3> (i.e. hallowed, dedicated) <b>to God in</b> (in union with and by means of) <b>Jesus Christ.</b> See Rom. i. 7, note. c<b>alled [to be] saints, with all, &c.]</b> These words do not belong to the designations just preceding, ‘<i>as are all</i>, &c., but form part of the address of the Epistle, so that these all are partakers with the Corinth- ians in it. They form a weighty and pre- cious addition,—made here doubtless to shew the Corinthians, that membership of God's Holy Catholic Church consisted not in being planted, or presided over by Paul, Apollos, or Cephas (or their successors), but in <i>calling on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> The Church of England has adopted from this verse her solemn ex- planation of the term, in the ‘Prayer for all sorts and conditions of men:’ “ More especially, we pray for the good estate of <i>the Catholic Church</i>: that it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that <i>all who profess and call themselves</i> <i>Christians </i>may be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of<h2><u>life.” The phrase “<i>to call upon the name of the Lord,</i>” was one adopted from the Old Test.: see Joel ii. 32; the adjunct our <b>Lord Jesus Christ</b>, defines that Lord (Je- hovah) on whom the Christians called, to be Jesus Christ,—and is a direct testi- mony to the divine worship of Jesus Christ, as universal in the Church. <b>in every place, both their’s</b> (in their country, wherever that may be) <b>and our’s.</b> This connexion is far better than to join <b>both their’s and our’s</b> with <b>Lord</b>, thereby making the first our superfluous. <b>their’s</b>, refers <i>to the all that call,</i> &e., <b>our’s </b>to Paul, and Sosthenes, and those whom he is addressing. 3.</u></h2> See Rom. i. 7, note.

Such persons would contend for his apostolic authority, and maintain doc- trinally his teaching, <i>so far being right</i>; but, as usual with partisans, would magnify into importance practices and sayings of his which were in themselves indifferent, and forget that theirs was a service of per- fect freedom under one Master, even Christ. With these he does not deal <i>doctrinally </i>in the Epistle, as there was <i>no need for it:</i> but involves them in the same censure as the rest, and shews them in ch. ii., iii., iv. that he had no such purpose of gaining per- sonal honor among them, but only of build- ing them up in Christ. <b>I of Apollos</b>] Apollos (Acts xviii. 24, ff.) had come to Corinth after the departure of Paul, and being eloquent, might attract some, to whom the bodily presence of Paul seemed weak and his speech contemptible. It would certainly appear that some occasion had been taken by this difference, to set too high a value on external and rhetorical form of putting forth the gospel of Christ. This the Apostle seems to be blaming (in part) in the conclusion of this, and the next chapter. And from ch. xvi. 12, it would seem likely that Apollos himself had been aware of the abuse of his manner of teach- ing which had taken place, and was un- willing, by repeating his visit just then, to sanction or increase it. <b>I of Cephas</b>] All we can say in possible explanation of this is, that as Peter was the <i>Apostle of the circumcision</i>,—as we know from Gal. ii. 11 ff. that his course of action on one occa- sion was reprehended by Paul, and as that course of action no doubt had influence and found followers, it is very conceivable that some of those who in Corinth lightly es- teemed Paul, might take advantage of this honored name, and cite against the Chris- tian liberty taught by their own spiritual founder, the stricter practice of Peter.

The words seems to apply to those who make a merit of <i>not being attached to any</i> human <i>teacher</i>,—who therefore slighted the apostleship of Paul.

This however will not explain all places where it occurs elsewhere: e.g. 1 Thess. ii. 18, <i>“We would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again,”</i>—where see note. So that after all perhaps it is best to regard it merely as an idiomatic way of speaking, when often only the singular is intended.<h3><u><b>that we may be able</u></h3> </b>“The Apostle lived not for himself, but for the Church: so that whatever grace God conferred on him, he thought given not for himself alone, but to enable him the better to help others.” Calvin.<h2><u> <b>5.</u></h2></b> ‘As He is, so are we in this world:’ 1 John iv. 17. <br><br><b>as the sufferings of Christ</b> (<i>endured by</i> Christ, whether in his own person, or in his mystical body, the Church, see Matt. xxv. 40, 45) <b>abound towards us </b>(i.e.<i> in our case, </i>see reff.), <b>even so through Christ our consolation also aboundeth.</b>—The form of expression is altered in the latter clause: instead of <i>“the comfort of Christ aboundeth,”</i> we have <b>through Christ aboundeth also our comfort</b>.

This opinion has been recently defended by Neander, Wieseler, and Dr. Davidson, but impugned by De Wette, on the grounds, (1) that <i>“in Asia”</i> can hardly refer to Ephesus, which St. Paul generally <i>names</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 82; xvi. 8; (2) that he was not in danger of his life in this tumult. The first ground is hardly tenable: there would be an appropriateness in the expression “in Asia” here, as he has in his mind an apologetic account of the reasons which hindered him from leaving those parts and coming to them. I own, however, that the strong expressions here used do not seem to me to find their justification in any thing which we know of that tumult or its consequences. I am unable to assign <i>any other event </i>as in the Apostle’s mind : but the expressions seem rather to regard a <i>deadly sickness,</i> than a persecution: sce below, verses 9, 10.<h3><u><b>so that we utterly despaired even of life</u></h3> </b>Such an expression surely would not be used of a tumult, where lite would have been <i>the first thing</i> in danger, if Paul had been at all mixed up in it,—but to some wearing and tedious suffering, inducing despondency in minor matters, which <i>even reached </i>the hope of life itself.<h2><u><b>9.</u></h2></b> carries on and intensifies the description of his hopeless state. <br><br><b>we had in ourselves the response (or, sentence) of death, </b>i.e. our answer within ourselves to the question, ‘Life or Death?’ was, ‘Death.’ <h3><u><b>that we should not .. .</u></h3></b> The expression of purpose is very similar in ch. iv. 7. <h3><u><b>which raiseth the dead</u></h3></b> Our thoughts were weaned from all hope of surviving in this life, and fixed on that better deliverance which God shall work when He raises us from the dead.—To see in this expression merely a figure (as De Wette), and understand ‘Who <i>raiseth the dead</i>’ as equivalent to ‘<i>Who delivers men from peril of their lives</i>?’ because such peril is below and elsewhere (ch. xi. 23) called “<i>death</i>,” is surely very forced. Understanding it literally as above, I cannot see how it can be spoken with reference to the Ephesian tumult. If it alludes to <i>any external danger</i>, 1 should be disposed to refer it to the same obscure part of St. Paul’s history to which he alludes 1 Cor. xv. 32, where he also speaks of the<i> hope of the resurrection </i>as his great support. But there would he this objection, that these two passages can hardly refer to the <i>same </i>event; <i>this </i>evidently had taken place <i>since </i>the sending of the first Epistle.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1IwdrrSk5Vg3I94yKLr4SBcAqmUne-F/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

See on that question, Introd. to 1 Cor. § v. <h2><u><b>16.</u></h2></b><i><b> </b>If this is the same journey </i>which is announced in 1 Cor. xvi. 5, the idea of visiting them <i>in the way to</i> Macedonia as well as after having passed through it, must have occurred to him subsequently to the sending of that Epistle; or may even then have been a <i>wish</i>, but not expressed, from uncertainty as to its possibility,—the main and longer visit being there principally dwelt on. But perhaps the following is the more likely account of the matter. He had announced to them in the lost Epistle (see 1 Cor. v. 9) his intention, as here, of visiting them <i>on his way </i>to Macedonia: but the intelligence from “them of the household of Chloe” had altered his intention, so that, in 1 Cor. xvi., he speaks of visiting them <i>after he should have passed through</i> Macedonia. For this he was accused of levity of purpose. Certainly, some intention of coming to them seems to have been mentioned in that lost Epistle; see 1 Cor. iv. 18. But the “<i>being brought on his way to Judea</i>” can hardly but be coincident with the almsbearing scheme of 1 Cor. xvi. 4: in which case the two plans certainly are modifications of one and the same. <h2><u><b>17.</u></h2> </b>Literally, <b>Did I at all use levity (of purpose)?

But this explanation is directly against the next verse, where yea and nay is clearly parallel to yea yea, and nay nay, here, the words being repeated, as in Matt. v. 37, without altering the sense : and inconsistent with ver. 23 and ch. ii. 1, where he says that his alteration of plan arose <i>from a desire to spare them.</i> <h2><u><b>18.</u></h2></b> Such fickleness, you know, was not my habit in preaching to you. <h3><u><b>God is faithful,</b> <b>that</u></h3> </b>i. e. as A.

Paul had sent Titus to Corinth, ch. xii. 18, partly to finish the collection for the saints, but principally to bring intelligence respecting the effect of the first Epistle. Probably it had been fixed that they should meet at Troas.<br><br><b> Titus my brother </b>implies a relation closer than merely that of Christian brotherhood —my <i>colleague </i>in the Apostleship.<h3><u><b>them</u></h3> </b>the disciples there, understood from the context.<h2><u><b>14—17.</u></h2> </b><i>Omitting, as presupposed, the fact of his having met with Titus in Macedonia, and the nature of the intelligence which he brought, he grounds on these a thanksgiving for that intelligence, and a magnification of his apostolic office.</i> It is evidently beside the purpose to refer this thanksgiving to the diffusion of the gospel in Macedonia, or in Troas, or to general considerations:—both the context, and the language itself (see below), shew that its reference is to the effects of the apostolic reproof on the Corinthians. <h2><u><b>14. leadeth us in triumph</u></h2> </b><i>Two kinds of persons </i>were led in triumph: the <i>participators of the victory, </i>and the <i>victims of the defeat.</i> In Col. ii. 15, where only the same word is used in the original, the <i>latter </i>are plainly meant; here, according to many Commentators, the <i>former</i>: which however is never elsewhere the reference of the word, but it always implies<i> triumphing over.</i> The proud Cleopatra refused the terms offered her by Augustus, using this word, and saying, “<i>I will not be triumphed over</i>.” Meyer in consequence understands it in this sense here:<b> who ever triumphs over us,</b> i.e. “ who ceases not to exhibit us, His former foes, as overcome by Him:’— and adds, “God <i>began </i>His triumph over them at their conversion:—over Paul at Damascus, where he made him a servant, from being an enemy. This triumph he ever continues, not ceasing to exhibit before the world these his former foes, by the results of their present service, as overcome by Him. This, in the case before us, was ffected by Paul, in that (as Titus brought him word to Macedonia) his Epistle had produced such good results in Corinth.” De Wette objects to this as a strange way of expressing thankfulness for deliverance from our anxiety. But<i> is it</i> so to those who look beneath the surface? In our spiritual course,<i> our only true triumphs </i>are <i>God’s </i>triumphs over us. His defeats of <i>us</i>, are <i>our only </i>real victories. I own that this yet appears to me to be the <i>only admissible rendering. </i>We must not violate the known usage of a word, and invent another for which there is no precedent, merely for the sake of imagined perspicuity. Such is that of ‘<i>causeth us to triumph,</i>” A. V., and some Commentators.

Clearly, towards you, under instruction as disciples. That is, we every where speak freely, concealing nothing, reserving nothing, suspecting nothing, but speaking out plainly: and we have no fear of dazzling your eyes, as Moses did those of the Jews.” Chrysostom.<h2><u><b>13.</u></h2> and </b>(do) <b>not </b>(place a vail on our face) <b>as Moses placed a vail on his face, inorder that </b>(see below) <b>the sons of Israel might not look stedfastly on the termination of that which was being done away </b>(viz. his <i>ministration</i>, see ver. 11, but spoken of as <i>glorified</i>: ‘the glory of his ministra tion’).—A mistake has been made with regard to the history in Exod. xxxiv. 35, which has considerably obscured the understanding of this verse. It is commonly assumed, that, Moses <i>spoke </i>to the Israelites, <i>having the vail on his face; </i>and this is implied in our version—‘till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.” But the Hebrew and Septuagint gave a different account: “and <i>when he ceased speaking to them</i>, he put a vail over his face.” He spoke to them <i>without</i> the vail, with his face shining and glorified:—<i>when he had done speaking,</i> he placed the vail on his face: and that, not because they were afraid to look on him, but as here, <i>that they might not look on the end,</i> or the fading,<i> of that transitory glory</i>; that they might only see it as long as it was the credential of his ministry, and then it might be withdrawn from their eyes. Thus the declaration of God’s will to then was not in openness of speech, but was interrupted and broken by intervals of concealment, which ours is not. The opposition is twofold: (1) between the <i>vailed</i> and the <i>unvailed </i>ministry, as regards the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and openness in the other: (2) between the ministry which was suspended by the vailing, that its end might not be seen, and that which proceeds from glory to glory, <i>having no termination. </i>On the common interpretation, Commentators have found an almost insuperable difficulty in the purpose here stated, “<i>that the children of Israel might not</i>,” &c. The usual escape from it has been to render it (see A.V.), <i>‘so that the Israelites could not, </i>as in vér. 7. But this is an ungrammatical rendering of the Greek. I may remark also, that the narrative in Exodus, the Septuagint version of which the Apostle here closely follows (see below on ver. 16), implies that the brightness of Moses’ face had <i>place not on that one occasion only, but throughout his whole ministry</i> between the and the people. <i>When he ceased speaking to them, he put on the vail:</i> but <i>whensoever he went in before the Lord </i>to speak to Him, the <i>vail</i> <i>was removed</i> till he came out, and <i>had spoken to the Israelites all that the Lord had commanded him,</i> during which speaking they saw that his face shone,—and after which speaking he<i> again put on the vail. </i>So that the vail was the symbol of concealment and transitoriness : the part revealed they might see: beyond that, they could not: the ministry was a broken, interrupted one; its end was wrapped in obscurity.—In the words, <i>“the end of that which was being done away,”</i> we must not think, as some Commentators have done, of <i>Christ </i>(Rom. x. 4), any further than it may be hinted in the background that when the law came to an end, He appeared.<h2><u><b>14—18.</u></h2> </b><i>The contrast is now made between the CHILDREN OF IsRAEL, on whose heart this vail still is in the reading of the O.T., and US ALL</i> (Christians),<i> who with uncovered face behold the glory of the Lord. </i>This section is parenthetical. Before and after it, the <i>ministry </i>is the subject: in it, <i>they to whom the ministry is directed.</i> But it serves to shew the <i>whole spirit </i>and <i>condition </i>of the two classes, and thus further to substantiate. the character of openness and. dom asserted of the Christian <b>14.

No reference whatever is made to the state of the Jews <i>under the preaching of the gospel, </i>but only<i> </i>as the objects of the O.T. ministration,—<i>then</i>, under the oral teaching of Moses,—<i>now</i>, in the reading of the O.T. —In order to understand what follows, the change of similitude must be carefully borne in mind.<h3><u><b>the same vail</u></h3></b> ‘the vail once on Moses’ face,’ is now regarded as laid on <i>their hearts</i>. It denoted the ceasing, the covering up, of his oral teaching; for it was put on <i>when he had done </i>speaking to the people. <i>Now, </i>his oral teaching has altogether ceased, and the <i>ministry </i>is carried on by <i>a book</i>. But as when we <i>listen</i>, the speaker is the <i>agent</i>, and the hearers are <i>passive</i>,—so on the other hand, when we <i>read</i>, <i>we </i>are the <i>agents</i>, and the book is <i>passive</i>. The book is the same to all: the difference between those who understand and those who do not understand is now a <i>subjective </i>difference—the vail is no longer on the face of the speaker, but on the <i>heart of the reader.</i> So that of necessity the form of the similitude is changed. <br><br><b>For </b>(answering to an understood clause, ‘and remain hardened’) <b>to the present day the same vail </b>(which was once on the face of Moses) <b>remains at the reading of the Old Covenant </b>(i.e. <b>‘Testament</b>: as we now popularly use the words, <i>the book comprising the ancient Covenant</i>), <b>the discovery not being made </b>(by the removal of the vail: literally, it <b>not being unvailed</b>),<b> that it</b> (the Old Test.) <b>is done away</b> (or, being done away: but the other is better here) <b>in Christ</b> (that the Old Covenant has passed away, being superseded by Christ). This I believe to be the only admissible sense of the words, <i>consistently with the symbolism of the passage.</i> The renderings, <i>‘remains not taken away—for it</i> (i.e the vail) <i>is done away in Christ,’ </i>and<i> </i>(as A.V.) ‘<i>remaineth ....untaken away . . . which vail is done away in Christ,</i>’—are inadmissible: (1) because they make the verb <b>is done away,</b> which thronghout the passage belongs to the <i>glory of the ministry,</i> to apply to the <i>vail</i>: and (2) because ‘they give no satisfactory sense. It is not <i>because </i>the vail can only be done away in Christ, that it now remains untaken away on their hearts, but<i> because their hearts are hardened. </i>The word in the original, <b>unvailed</b>, has been probably chosen, as is often the practice of the Apostle, on account of its relation to <i>vail</i>,—<b>it not being unvailed to them that</b>... <h2><u><b>15.</u></h2> But </b>(reassertion of the fact that it is not unvailed, with a view to the next clause) <b>to this day, whenever Moses is read, a vail lieth upon their heart</b> (understanding).<h2><u><b>16.</u></h2> </b>Here, the object of comparison is, <i>the having on a vail, and taking it off on going into the presence of the Lord. </i>This<i> Moses did</i>: and the choice of the <i>same words</i> as those of the Septuagint, shews the closeness of the comparison: “<i>But whensoever Moses went in before the Lord to speak to Him, the vail was taken away.</i>” This shall likewise be done in the case of the Israelites: <b>when it </b>(i.e. <i>their heart</i>,—not <i>Israel</i>, as some think,—nor <i>Moses</i>, as others) <b>turneth to the Lord</b> (here again the word is carefully chosen, being the very expression of the Septuagint, when the Israelites, having been afraid of the glory of the face of Moses, returned to him after being summoned by him:—“<i>they were afraid to</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qi_Zl-jI-fCUz1kwTZtz3sE31cp-BsQJ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Let me restate this,—as it is all-important towards the understanding of verses 17, 18. ‘When their heart<i> goes in to speak with God,</i>—ceases to contemplate the dead letter, and begins to commune with the Spirit of the old covenant (the Spirit of GOd), then the veil is removed, as it was from the face of Moses.’<h2><u><b>17.</u></h2> Now the Lord is the Spirit: </b>i.e. the <b>Lord </b>of ver. 16 is the <i>Spirit</i>, whose word the O.T. is: the <i>spirit</i>,—as opposed to the <i>letter</i>;—which <i>giveth life,</i> ver. 6: meaning, ‘<i>thé Lord</i>,’ as here spoken of, “Christ,” ‘<i>is the Spirit</i>,’ is identical with the Holy Spirit: not personally nor essentially, but, as is shewn by the words “<i>the Spirit of the Lord</i>” following, <i>in this department of His divine working</i>:— <i>Christ</i>, here, <i>is the Spirit of Christ.</i> <b>and where the Spirit of the Lord</b> (see above) <b>is, is liberty.</b> They are fettered in spirit as Jong as they are slaves to the letter, as long as they have the vail on their hearts; but when they turn to the Lord the Spirit, which is not <i>a Spirit of bondage, but of adoption</i>, Rom. viii. 15, —and by virtue of whom “<i>thou art no longer a slave, but a son</i>,” Gal. iv. 7, —then they are at liberty.<h2><u><b>18.</u></h2> But</b> (the sight of the Jews is thus intercepted; in contrast to whom)<b> WE all </b>(‘<i>all Christians</i>: not ‘we Apostles and teachers:’ the contrast is to the children of Israel above), <b>with unvailed face</b> (the vail having been removed at our conversion: the stress is on these words) <b>beholding in a mirror the glory of the Lord</b> (i.e. Christ: from ver. 16, 17. The gospel is this mirror, the ‘<i>Gospel of the glory of God,’ </i>ch. iv. 4, and we, looking on it with unveiled face, are the contrast to the Jews, with veiled hearts reading their law), <b>are being transfigured into the same image</b> (which we see in the mirror: the image of the glory of Christ, see Gal. iv. 19; and 1 John iii. 3.

The other renderings are out of the question, viz.: (1) “<i>the Lord of the Spirit,</i>” i.e. Christ, whose Spirit He is; which seems fo me to convey very little meaning, besides being an expression wholly unprecedented: (2) that of A.V. and of the Vulgate, and others, ‘<i>the Spirit of the Lord,</i>’ and (3) that of Chrysostom and others, ‘<i>the Spirit who is the Lord.’</i><h2><u><b>IV. 1—6.</u></h2> </b><i>Taking up again the subject of his freedom of speech </i>(ch. iii. 12), <i>he declares his renunciation of all deceit, and manifestation of the truth to every man</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VFAZjgDwI5A8s1yakEFdAWLihEhQeaT/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For he does not deal with any such reproach here, but with matters common to all human ministers of the word.—All this is a following out in detail of the assertion, “<i>we shrink not back</i>,” ver. 1, already enlarged on in <i>one of its departments,</i> that of <i>not shrinking from openness of speech</i>,—and now to be put forth in <i>another</i>, viz. <i>bearing up against outward and inward difficulties.</i>— If <i>any </i>polemical purpose is to be sought, it is the setting forth of the abundance of sufferings, the glorying in weakness (ch. xi. 23, 30), which substantiated his apostolic mission: but even such purpose is only in the background ; he is pouring out, in the fulness of his heart, the manifold discouragements and the far more exceeding encouragements of his office.<h2><u><b>7.</u></h2> this treasure, </b>viz. ‘<i>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God</i>, ver. 6. “Being that he had spoken many and great things concerning this ineffable glory: that no one might say, ‘But how is it that being partakers of so great glory we remain in the mortal body?’ he goes on to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11pBlfxB_9LQ6RJUp4Y331QkbWe9D7wJ8/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Some think the treasure to be the whole ministry: but it seems simpler to refer it to that which has immediately preceded, in a style like that of Paul, in which each successive idea so commonly evolves itself out of the last. The <b>vessel </b>is the <i>body</i>, not the whole personality ; the “<i>outer man</i>” of ver. 16; see ver. 10.

By this antithesis, the wonderful greatness of the divine power is strikingly brought out: God exhibits DEATH in the <i>living</i>, that He may exhibit LIFE in the <i>dying</i>. <h2><u><b>12.</u></h2> </b>By it is also brought out that which is here the immediate subject,—the vast and unexampled trials of the apostolic office, all summed up in these words: <b>So then death worketh in us, but life in you;</b> i.e. ‘<i>the trials by which the dying of Jesus is exhibited in us, are exclusively and peculiarly OUR OWN,—whereas </i>(and this is decisive for the spiritual sense of the word <b>life</b>) <i>the life, whereof we are to be witnesses, extends beyond ourselves, nay, finds its field of action and energizing IN YOU</i>.’ Chrysostom, Calvin, and others, take the verse ironically, “<i>so we have all the danger, and you all the profit</i>:’ but such a sentiment seems alien from the spirit of the passage. Meyer, as unfortunately, limits the meaning to <i>natural life,</i> whereas (as above) the context plainly evinces <i>spiritual life </i>to be meant, not merely natural.—In Rom. viii. 10, 11, the vivifying influence of His Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is spoken of as extending to the body also; <i>here</i>, the upholding influence of Him who delivers and preserves the body, is spoken of as vivifying the whole man: LIFE, in both places, <i>being the higher and spiritual life</i>, <i>including </i>the lower and natural. ‘And, in our relative positions,—of this <i>life</i>, YE are the examples,—a church of believers, alive to God through Christ in your various vocations, and not called on to be exhibited in an arena (1 Cor. iv. 9: Heb. x. 33), as WE are, who are (not indeed excluded from that <i>life</i>,—nay, it flows from us to you,— but are) more especially examples of conformity to the <i>death </i>of our common Lord: —in whom DEATH WORKETH.’<h2><u><b>13—18.</u></h2> </b>ENCOURAGEMENTS: and first, FAITH, which enables us to go on preaching to you.

The idea that the Apostle could not thus speak of the resurrection, because he expected (1 Cor. xv. 51, 52; i. 8; ch. i. 13, 14) to be <i>alive </i>at the day of Christ, is best refuted by this very passage, ch. v. 1 ff., where <i>his admission of at least the possibility of his death </i>is<i> </i>distinctly set forth. The fact is that the anticipation of being raised here, having respect rather to the contrast of the future glory with the present suffer- ing, does not necessarily imply one or other side of the alternative of being quick or dead at the Lord’s coming, but em- braces all, quick and dead, in one blessed resurrection-state. —This confidence, of being presented at that day “<i>together with you”</i> is only analogous to his expressions elsewhere; see ch. i. 14; 1 Thess, ii. 19, 20;<h2><u><b>15.</u></h2></b> Explanation of <b>together with you </b>as a ground of his trust: with reference also to what was said of <i>life working in you</i>, ver. 12; viz. that all, both the sufferings and victory of the ministers, are <i>for the church</i>: see the parallel expression, ch. i. 6, 7. <br><br><b>For all things</b> (of which we have been speaking: or perhaps hyperbolically, ALL THINGS, the whole working and arrangements of God, as in 1 Cor. iii, 22) <b>are on your behalf, that Grace, having abounded by means of the greater number</b> (who have received it),<b> may multiply the thanks- giving</b> (which shall accrue) <b>to the glory of God. </b>Besides this rendering (1), <i>three others </i>are possible: (2) ‘<i>that Grace,</i> <i>having abounded, may, on account of the thanksgiving of the greater number, be multiplied to the glory of God:</i> (3) <i>‘that Grace, having abounded, may, by means of the greater number, multiply the thanks- giving to the glory of God:</i> (4) <i>‘that Grace, having multiplied by means of the greater number the thanksgiving, may abound to the glory of God.’ </i>See these discussed, and my reason for preferring (1), in my Greek Test. As to the <i>sense</i> see the very similar sentiment, ch. i. 11), <i>thanksgiving </i>is the highest and noblest offering of the Church to God’s glory (compare Ps. 1. 23): <i>that this may be rendered</i>, in the best sense, as the result of the working of grace which has become abundant by means of the many recipients, is the great end of the Christian ministry.<h2><u><b>16—18.</u></h2> </b><i>Second ground of encou- ragement—HOPE</i>. <b>16.] Wherefore</b> (on account of the hope implied in the faith spoken of ver. 14, which he is about to expand) <b>we shrink not back</b> (as in ver. 1: but <i>now</i>, owing to <i>despair</i>); <b>but </b>(on the contrary)<b> though even our outward man is being wasted away</b> (i. e. our <i>body</i>, see Rom. vii. 22, <i>is</i>, by this continued “<i>killing</i>” and “<i>working of death</i>,” <i>being worn out:</i> —he is not as yet speaking of dissolution by death, but only of gradual approxima- tion to it), <b>yet our inner (man) is being renewed day by day</b>: i.e. ‘our spiritual life, the life which testifies the life of Jesus, even in our mortal bodies (ver. 11), is con- tinually fed with fresh accessions of grace: see next verse.

But none need be raised. The <i>dwelling </i>which in this verse is said, <i>at the time of dissolution,</i> to be <b>in </b><i>the heavens</i>, is, <i>when we put it on,</i> in the next verse, our <i>own dwelling-place,</i> which<i> is</i> <b>from</b><i><b> </b>heaven. </i>Thus the intermediate state, though lightly passed over, as not belonging to the subject, is evidently in the mind of St. Paul.—Some Commentators understand<i> these words themselves (“a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens”) </i>of the<i> intermediate state of absence from the body</i>: others, of an <i>immediate glorified body in heaven</i>, to be united with the body of the resurrection. Calvin hesitates: “It is uncertain whether he intends the state of blessed immortality which awaits the faithful after death, or the incorruptible and glorious body which shall be after the resurrection. In either of these senses there is nothing objectionable: but I prefer taking it, that the beginning of this building shall be the blessed state of the soul after death, and its consummation the glory of the final resurrection.” But if this be so, (1) the parallel will not hold, between the <i>dwelling </i>in one case, and the dwelling in the other,—and (2) the language of ver. 2 is against it, see below.<h2><u><b>2.</u></h2> For also </b>(our knowledge, that we possess such a building of God, even in the case of our body being dissolved, is testified by the <i>earnest desire</i> which we have, to put on that new body <i>without</i> <i>such dissolution taking place.</i> See the similar argument in Rom. viii. 18, 19) <b>in this</b> (tabernacle)<b> we groan</b> (see Rom. viii. 23), <b>longing </b>(i.e. because we desire, the reason of our groaning)<b> to put on over this</b> (viz. <i>by being alive at the day of Christ</i>, and <i>not </i>dissolved as in ver. 1:—see on ver. 4 below.—The similitude is slightly changed : the <i>house </i>is now to be <i>put on,</i> as an outer garment, <i>over the fleshly body</i>) <b>our dwelling-place </b>(the word is slightly different from that rendered <i>dwelling </i>in ver. 1: that one being more general, this more appropriated to an inhabitant) <b>from heaven</b> (treated now as if<i> brought with </i>the Lord at His coming, and put upon us who are alive, and remain then.—“Therefore,” says Bengel, “this dwelling-place<i> is not heaven itself</i>”): <h2><u><b>3.</u></h2> seeing that we shall verily be found</b> (shall prove to be) <b>clothed </b>(‘<i>having put on clothing,</i>’ viz. <i>a body</i>), <b>not naked </b>(<i>without a body:</i> see this rendering justified in my Greek Test., where I have also discussed the other translations.

If the words “<i>in Ephesus</i>” are omitted, the sentence must be read <b>to the saints, who are also faithful in Christ Jesus.</b> The word <b>saints</b> is used here in its widest sense, as designating the members of Christ’s visible church, presumed to fulfil the conditions of that membership: see especially ch. v. 3. These words follow rather unusually, separated from the saints by the designation of abode: a circumstance which might seem to strengthen the suspicion against the words <i>“in Ephesus,”</i> were not such transpositions by no means unexampled in St. Paul. See the regular order in Col. i. 2.<br><br><b>in Christ Jesus</b> belongs only to <i>the faithful:</i> see Col. i. 2: <b>faithful</b>, i.e. <b>believers</b> (persons who are), <b>in Christ Jesus. </b>This, in its highest sense, not mere <i>truth</i>, or <i>faithfulness</i>, is imported.

Not the <i>death </i>of the victim, but its BLOOD, was the typical instrument of expiation. And I may notice that in Phil. ii. 8, where Christ’s <i>obedience</i>, not His atonement, is spoken of, there is no mention of His shedding His Blood, only of the act of His Death), he remission (not <i>‘overlooking;</i>” see note on Rom. iii. 25) <b>of </b>(our) <b>transgressions </b>(explanation of the words, <i>our Redemption:</i> not to be limited, but extending to all riddance from the practice and consequences of our trans- gressions), <b>according to the riches of His grace</b> (this alone would prevent the word “<i>remission</i>” applying to merely the <i>forgiveness </i>of sins.

So that his use of the word <b>mystery </b>has nothing in common, except, the facts of concealment and revelation, with the mysteries of the heathen world, nor with any secret tradition over and above the gospel as revealed in the Scriptures.

Hardly less confusing is the rendering of Calvin and others, <i>until the time</i> of the dispensation, &c., thereby introducing into the <i>act of pur- posing</i> the complex idea of <i>decreed and laid up,</i> instead of the simple one which the con- text requires) <b>the œconomy</b> (dispensation) <b>of the fulness of the times </b>(or, <b>the fulfilment of the seasons.</b> The mistake which has misted almost all the Commentators here, aud which as far as I know Stier has been the only one to expose, has been that of taking <i>the fulness of the times</i> as a fixed date in the fact, and making it mean, the coming of Christ, as Gal. iv. 4, —whereas usage, and the sense, determine it to mean, the whole duration of the Gospel times; compare especially ch. ii. 7; 1 Cor.x. 11; and Luke xxi. 24; Acts i. 7; iii, 19,21; 1 Tim. ii. 6. Thus <i>the dispensation of the fulness of the times</i> will mean, the filling up, completing, fulfilment, of the appointed seasons, carrying on during the Gospel dispensation. Now, belonging to, carried on during, this fulfilling of the periods or seasons, is the <i>œconomy </i>or <i>dispensation </i>here spoken of. And having regard to the derivation and usage of the word, it will mean, <i>the giving</i> <i>forth of the Gospel under God's providential arrangements.</i> First and greatest of all, HE is the <i>Steward or œconomus, of the dispensation:</i> then, above all others, His divine Son: and as proceeding from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit— and then in subordinate degrees every one who <i>is entrusted with carrying out the œconomy,</i> i.e. all Christians, even to the lowest, as <i>stewards of the manifold grace of God,</i> 1 Pet. iv. 10.

So we know that Christ is above all, though we are not able to name all His subjects”): <h2><u><b>22.</b></u></h2> <b>and subjected all things under His feet</b> (from the Messianic Ps, viii.; not without an allusion also above to Ps. cx. 1),<b> and gave</b> (<i>‘presented</i>;’ keep the literal sense: not ‘ <i>appointed </i>;’ see below) HIM (emphatic, from its position: HIM, thus exalted, thus glorified, the Father not only raised to this supereminence, but gave Him to His redeemed as their Head, &c.) <b>as head over all things to the Church </b>(the meaning is thus to be gained, from what follows: CHRIST is Head over all things: the Church is the BODY of Christ, and as such is the fulness of Him who fills all with all: the Head of such a Body, is Head over all things; therefore when God gives Christ as <i>Head </i>to the church, He gives Him as <i>Head over</i> <i>all</i> <i>things </i>to the church, from the necessity of the case.

But I am disposed to seek my interpretation of the words from a much more obvious source: viz. the persuasion and common parlance of mankind, founded on analogy with well known facts. We are tempted by evil spirits, who have access to us, and suggest thoughts and desires to our minds. We are surrounded by the air, which is the vehicle of speech and of all suggestions to our senses. Tried continually as we are by these temptations, what so natural, as to assign to their ministers a dwelling in, and power over that element which is the vehicle of them to us? And thus our Lord, in the parable of the sower, when He would represent the devil coming and taking away the seed out of the heart, figures him by <i>the birds of the air</i> (or,<i> of heaven</i>). The Apostle then, in using this expression, would be appealing to the common feeling of his readers, not to any recondite or questionable system of dæmonology. That traces are found in such systems, of a belief agreeing with this, is merely a proof that they have embodied the same general feeling, and may be used in illustration, not as the ground, of the Apostle’s saying),<b> of the spirit</b> (<i>the power</i> being used as designating [see above] the personal aggregate of those evil ones who have this power,<b> the spirit</b>, in apposition with it, represents their aggregate character, as an influence on the human mind, a spirit of ungodliness and disobedience,— the “<i>spirit of the world</i>” of 1 Cor. ii. 12, —the aggregate of the “<i>seducing spirits</i>” of 1 Tim. iv. 1) <b>which is now</b> (i.e. ‘still:’ contrast to “<i>once</i>,’—to <i>you</i>, who have escaped from his government above) <b>working in the sons of</b> (the expression is a Hebraism, but is strictly reproduced in the fact: that of which they are sons, is the source and spring of their lives, not merely an accidental quality belonging to them) <b>disobedience</b>: <h2><u><b>3.</b></u></h2> <b>among whom </b>(the “<i>sons of disobedience</i>:” not merely local, but ‘numbered among whom’) <b>we also all</b> (WHO?

It can hardly then be that here he should have departed from his universal usage, and placed an unmeaning “<i>all</i>” after “<i>we</i>,” merely to signify, ‘we Jews, every one of us.

V., <i>‘hath </i>quickened’—a definite act in time, not an abiding consequence is spoken of) <b>us together with Christ</b> (Christ was THE RESURRECTION and the Life, and we follow in and because of Him. The disputes about the meaning of this <i>vivifying</i>, or <i>quickening</i>, have arisen from not bearing in mind the relation in New Test. language between natural and spiritual death. We have often had occasion to observe that spiritual death in the New Test. includes in it and bears with it natural death as a consequence, to such an extent that this latter is often not thought of as worth mentioning : see especially John xi. 25, 26, which is the key-text for all passages regarding life in Christ. So here—God vivified us together with Christ : in the one act and fact of His Resurrection He raised all His people—to spiritual life, and in that to victory over death, both spiritual, and therefore necessarily physical also. To dispute therefore whether such an expression as this is past [spiritual], or future [physical], is to forget that the whole includes its parts. Our <i>spiritual life</i> is the primary subject of the Apostle’s thought: but this includes in itself our share in the Resurrection and exaltation [ver. 6] of Christ.

The answer must be given by comparing this with the very similar expression in Col. i. 26, 27, where it is manifest (1) that the <i>ages </i>from which the mystery was hidden are the past ages of this world; (2) that those to whom, as here, God will make known the riches of His glory, are His saints, i.e. His church on earth. Therefore I conceivé we are compelled to interpret analogously: viz. to understand the “<i>ages to come</i>” of the coming ages of the church, and the per- sons involved in them to be the future members of the church. Thus the mean- ing will be nearly as in ch. i, 12.—The supposed reference to the future state of glory seems not to agree with <i>the language here</i>,—nor with the fact that the second coming and future kingdom of Christ are hardly ever alluded to in this Epistle)<b> the exceeding riches of His grace in</b> (of the material of which this display of His grace will consist, the department in which it will find its exercise) <b>kindness</b> (see especially Rom. ii. 4) towards us in see ‘<i>through</i>’ as A.

So in the course of God’s providence, our good works are marked out for and assigned to each one of us) <b>that we should walk in them</b>. Thus the truth of the maxim “good works do not go before him who is to be justified, but follow after one who is justified,” is shewn.

The Apostle names Silvanus and Timothy with himself, as having with him founded the church at Thessalonica, see Acts xvi. 1; xvii. 14. Silvanus is placed before Timothy, then a youth (Acts xvi. 1 f., see further in Introd. to 1 Tim. § i. 3, 4), as being one “<i>chief among the brethren</i>” (Acts xv. 22, 32; xviii. 5), and a <i>prophet</i> (ib. xv. 32, see also 2 Cor. i. 19; 1 Pet. v. 12). He does not name himself <i>an Apostle</i>, probably because his Apostleship needed not any substantiation to the Thessalonians. For the same reason he omits the designation in the Epistle to the Philippians. <h3><u><b>unto the church</b></u></h3> So in 2 Thess., Gal., 1 and 2 Cor.: in the other Epistles, viz, Rom., Eph., Col., Phil., more generally, e.g.,—“<i>to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints</i>.” This is most probably accounted for by the circumstances of, the various Epistles. We may notice that the genitive plural of the <i>persons constituting the church</i> occurs only in the addresses of these two Epistles. We may render ‘of Thessalonians,’ or ‘of the Thessalonians:’ better the former. <br><br><b>in God the Father</b> marks them as not being heathens,—and <b>the Lord </b> <b>Jesus Christ</b> as not being Jews.—The <b>in</b>, as usual, denotes <i>communion</i> and <i>participation</i> <i>in</i>, as the element of spiritual life. “Grace and peace from God be unto you, that you who are deprived of human favour and secular peace, may have both these with God.” Anselm.

For undoubted as it is that he often, e. g. ch. iii. 1, 2, where see note, uses the plural of himself alone, yet it is as undoubted that he uses it also of himself and of his fellow-labourers—e. g., 2Cor. i. 18, 19. <h3><u><b>always for you all</b></u></h3> We have the same alliteration Eph. v. 20. On the latter words in this verse, see Rom. i. 9 f. <br><br><b>unceasingly</b> seems, by the nearly parallel place, Rom. i. 9, to belong to <i>what goes before</i>, not to <i>what follows</i>. Such a formula would naturally repeat, itself, as far as specifications of this kind are concerned. <h2><u><b>3.</b></u></h2> <b>faith, love, hope</b>, are the three great Christian graces of 1 Cor. xiii. See also ch. v.8; Col. i. 4, 5.<h3><u><b>the labour of your love</b></u></h3> probably <i>towards the sick and needy strangers</i>, compare Acts xx. 35; Rom. xvi. 6, 12. <b>of... love</b>, not as <i>springing from</i>, but as <i>belonging to</i>, love,—<i>characterizing</i> it. <b>the endurance</b> (or, <b>patience</b>) <b>of your hope</b>— i.e. endurance (in trials) which belongs to (see above), characterizes, your hope; and also nourishes it, in turn: compare Rom, xv. 4. <h3><u><b>of our</b> <b>Lord Jesus Christ</b></u></h3> specifies the hope—that it is a hope of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ (compare ver. 10). Olshausen refers the words to all three ceding substantives—but this seems alien from St.Paul’s style. On all the three Jowett says well, “Your faith, hope, and love; a faith that had its outward effect on your lives : a love that spent itself in the service of others: a hope that was no mere transient feeling, but was content to wait for the things unseen when Christ should be revealed.” <br><br><b>before God</b> connects most naturally with ver. 2—<b>making mention .... before God</b>: not to the genitives preceding (see Rom. iv. 17; xiv. 22).<h2><u><b>4.</u></h2> knowing</b> refers back to <i>remembering</i>, <b>in that we know</b>—or, <b>for we know</b>. It must not be paraphrased “<i>in that</i> <i>ye</i> <i>know</i>,” as some have done. The words <b>by</b> <b>God</b> belong to “<i>beloved</i>,” as in 2 Thess. ii. 13, see also Rom. i. 7: not, as A. V., to “<i>your election</i>,” which is an ungrammatical rendering. <br><br>The word <b>election</b> must not be softened down: it is the election unto life of individual believers by God, so commonly adduced by St. Paul (reff.: and 1 Cor. i. 27. <br><br><b>your election</b>, i.e. <b>the election of you</b>: knowing that God elected you. <h2><u><b>5. Because</b></u></h2> Verses 5, 6 ff. are meant not to explain <i>wherein</i> their election <i>consisted</i>, but to give reasons in matter of fact for concluding the existence of that election. These reasons are (1) the power and confidence with which he and Silvanus and Timothy preached among them (ver. 5), and (2) the earnest and joyful manner in which the Thessalonians received it (vv. 6 ff.). Both these were signs of God’s grace to them—tokens of their election vouchsafed by Him. <h3><u><b>our gospel</b></u></h3> i.e. the gospel which we preached. <h3><u><b>came unto you</b></u></h3> literally, <b>became to you</b>—proved to be, in its approach to you. The preposition <b>in</b>, thrice repeated, indicates the form and manner in which the <i>preaching</i> <i>was carried on</i>, not that in which the Thessalonians received it, which is not treated till ver. 6. <h3><u><b>in power</b></u></h3> not ‘<i>in miracles</i>,’ but <b>in power</b> of utterance and of energy. <h3><u><b>and in the Holy Ghost</b></u></h3> i.e. not only in force and energy, but <b>in</b> <b>the Holy Ghost</b>—in a manner which could only be ascribed to the operation of the Holy Spirit. <br><br><b>in much confidence</b> (of faith). This confidence (see above) was that in which <i>Paul and Silvanus and</i> <i>Timothy preached to them</i>: not <b>that in</b> <b>which they </b><i><b>received </b></i><b>the preaching.</b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tvc-TVlCI4UGRNEF7_mU9CJ1BMpCSbnE/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is somewhat difficult here to fix exactly the point of comparison, in which they imitated their ministers and Christ. Certainly it is not merely, in <i>receiving the word</i>—for to omit other objections, this would not apply at all to Him :—and therefore, not in any qualifying detail of their <i>method</i> of reception of the word.—So far being clear, we have but one particular left, and that respects the circumstances under which, and the spirit with which: and here we find a point of comparison even with Christ Himself: viz. joyful endurance in spirit under sufferings. This it was in which they imitated the Apostles, and their divine Master, and which made them patterns to other churches (see below). —For this affliction in which they <i>received the word</i>, see Acts xvii. 5—10; ch. ii. 14; iii. 2, 3, 5. <h3><u><b>receiving</b></u></h3> i.e.<b>in that ye received.</b> <h3><u><b>joy of the Holy Spirit</b></u></h3> i.e. <b>joy wrought by the Holy Spirit.</b><h2><u><b>7.</b></u></h2> <i>Further specification of the eminence of the Thessalonians’ Christian character.</i><h3><u><b>an example</b></u></h3> said of the whole church as one. <h3><u><b>to all that believe</b></u></h3> <b>to the whole of the believers</b>: not as Chrysostom understands it, all that believed before you: for it was not so: the only church in Europe which was in Christ before the Thessalonian, was the Philippian (Acts xvi. 12— xvii. 1; see ch. ii. 2). <br><br><b>Macedonia and Achaia</b>, compare Rom. xv. 26; Acts xix. 21: the two Roman provinces, comprehending Northern and Southern Greece. There is no reference, as Theodoret thinks, to the <i>Greeks</i> being “very great nations, and admired for wisdom,” and so <i>their praise</i> being the greater: these are mentioned simply because the Apostle had been, since their conversion, in Macedonia, and had left Silvanus and Timothy there,—and was now in Achaia.<h2><u><b>8.</b></u></h2> <i>Proof of the praise in ver.</i>7.<br><br><b> from you</b> is merely local; not by you, as preachers. <h3><u><b>hath sounded out</b></u></h3> Chrysostom remarks that the similitude is from the clear sound of a trumpet, filling all the space surrounding.

By the words, <b>whom he raised from the dead</b>, that whereby (Rom. i. 4) Jesus was declared to be the Son of God with power, is emphatically prefixed to His name. <br><br><b>who delivereth</b>: not, as A.V., past, <i>‘who delivered,’</i> but descriptive of His office, our Deliverer.<h3><u><b>which is coming</b></u></h3> compare <b>Eph. v. 6</b>; Col. iii. 6.<h2><u><b>CH.

These countrymen of the Thessalonians were not Jews, wholly nor in part, but Gentiles only. For they are set in distinct contrast here to <i>the Jews</i>.<br><br><b>they</b>, the members of the Judaean churches mentioned above.<h2><u><b>15, 16.</b></u></h2> <i>Characterization of the Jews as enemies of the Gospel and of mankind</i>. Jowett’s note is worth quoting: “Wherever the Apostle had gone on his second journey, he had been persecuted by the Jews: and the longer he travelled about among Gentile cities, the more he must have been sensible of the feeling with which his countrymen were regarded. Isolated as they were from the rest of the world in every city, a people within a people, it was impossible that they should not be united for their own self-defence, and regarded with suspicion by the rest of mankind. But their inner nature was not less repugnant to the nobler as well as the baser feelings of Greece and Rome. Their fierce nationality had outlived itself: though worshippers of the true God, they knew Him not to be the God of all the nations of the earth: hated and despised by others, they could but cherish in return an impotent contempt and hatred of other men. What wonder that, for an instant (? on all this see below), the Apostle should have felt that this Gentile feeling was not wholly groundless? or that he should use words which recall the expression of Tacitus, in characterizing the Jews,—‘that they had the hatred of enemies towards all other nations?’” <h2><u><b>15. killed Jesus the Lord</b></u></h2> The arrangement of the words in the original is peculiar, throwing “<i>the Lord</i>” into strong emphasis—Jesus who was their Lord, whom they ought to have welcomed and obeyed. <h3><u><b>drove out us</b></u></h3> by persecution, viz., from among you, Acts xvii. 5 ff. <h2><u><b>16.</b></u></h2> <b>us</b> refers to Paul and Silas. In the words <b>are contrary to all men</b>, most. Commentators, and recently Jowett (see above), have seen the “<i>hatred of the human race</i>,” ascribed to the Jews by Tacitus,and by several other classic authors. But it is hardly possible that St. Paul, himself a Jew, should have blamed an exclusiveness which arose from the strict monotheism and legal purity of the Jew: and besides this, the construction having been hitherto carried on by copulae, but now dropping them, most naturally goes on from this <i>contrariety</i> to what next follows, viz., <i>their forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles</i>, specifying wherein the contrariety consists, viz. in opposing the salvation of mankind by the Gospel.<h3><u><b>to the end that they may fill up their sins alway</b></u></h3> This is said, not of the intention of the Jews themselves, but of their course of conduct, viewed as having an intent in the divine purposes: as so often in St.Paul. The meaning of the expression is, that they may bring up the measure of their sins to the pre- scribed point. <b>But</b> (this their opposition to God and men shall not avail them : for) <b>the</b> (predestined, or predicted, or merited) <b>wrath</b> (of God) <b>came upon them</b> (he looks <i>back</i> on the fact in the divine counsels as a thing in past time, i.e. ‘was appointed to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wivXHPynhWK8lOyNBXCdCecXvjqldIRG/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But he does not look forward to this as anticipating a reward for the conversion of the Thessalonians, or that their conversion will compensate for his having persecuted the Church before, but from generous desire to be found at that day with the fruits of his labour, and that they might be his boast and he theirs before the Lord; see 2 Cor. i. 14; Phil. ii. 16. <h2><u><b>20.</b></u></h2> The words <b>at his coming</b> further specify what went before: that it is not merely in His presence, always about His people, but then, when He shall be clearly and finally manifested.

Therefore <i>sanctification </i>must be taken in the most general sense, and that which is afterwards introduced, as forming a <i>part</i> of our <i>sanctification</i>. <h3><u><b>your sanctification</b></u></h3> i.e. <b>the </b> <b>sanctification of you</b>.<h2><u><b>4.</b></u></h2> On the meaning of the expression, <b>his own vessel</b>, there has been much difference. Very many Commentators understand it of ‘<i>the body</i>.’ But it is fatal to this interpretation, (1) that it must force an untenable meaning on the pre- ceding verb, which can only mean ‘<i>to acquire</i>,’ not, as in A. V., ‘<i>to possess</i>.’ Chrysostom, whose sense of Greek usage led him to feel this, tries to fit the mean- ing ‘<i>to acquire</i>’ into the sense: saying, “We do really <i>acquire</i> the body, when it remains pure, and is in sanctification ” (so Dr. Vaughan also). But this is lame enough, and would not, as De Wette remarks, answer for the other member of the sentence, “<i>not in the lust of carnal desire</i>.” (2) That the mere use of the word <b>vessel</b>, without any explanation, could hardly point at the <i>body</i>. In all the passages ordinarily quoted to support it, the metaphor is further explained by the context. 2 Cor. iv. 7 is evidently no case in point, the epithet “<i>earthen</i>” being there added, and the body being simply <i>compared </i> to an <i>earthen vessel</i>. (3) The order of the words in the original is against it, by which the whole stress is laid on the word <i>own</i>. This would be without meaning if “vessel” meant the body: for how could a man <i>acquire </i>another’s body? (4) But a more fatal objection than any of the former is, that the context is entirely against the meaning. The <i>sanctification</i> has been explained to consist in abstaining from <b>fornication</b>. And now this <i>fornication </i> comes to be specified, wherein it consists, and how it may be guarded against : viz. in carrying on the divinely-appointed commerce of the sexes in holiness and honour. In fact, the thought is exactly as in 1 Cor. vii. 2, “ <i>Because of fornications, </i> <i>let each man </i><b>have his own wife,</b> <i>and let each woman</i> <b>have her own husband.</b>” Many have therefore understood vessel in its literal meaning as applied to “<i>the matter</i>” in hand,—i.e. the <i>woman</i> (or indeed the <i>man</i>, on the other side, inasmuch as the woman has <i>power </i>over his body, see 1 Cor. vii. 4.—So that thus it would be an exhortation to the woman also). Thus the context would be satisfied, and the emphatic position of <b>his own</b> (as in 1 Cor. vii. 2);—and <b>acquire </b>would re- tain its proper meaning: <b>that each of you should know how to acquire his own vessel</b> (for this purpose) <b>in sanctification and honour</b>. This sense of <i>vessel </i>is found in the Jewish books; and the verb rendered “<i>acquire</i>” was commonly used of taking a wife. This interpretation is that of some of the principal among the ancients, including Augustine, and of many of the principal moderns. The objection to it alleged by Calvin and others, that<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ahadz3uvmn0mAzM5TlR2G5_x4GMqq8X-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

How some of the best modern Commentators can have entertained this view, I am at a loss to imagine. For (1) the sense is carried on from vv. 4, 5, without any thing to mark a change of topic: and (2) when the Apostle sums up the whole in ver. 7, he mentions merely impurity, without the slightest allusion to the other. To say that more than one kind of sin must be mentioned because he speaks of “ <i>all these things</i>” is mere trifling: this expression merely generalizes from the sin mentioned to a wider range. I understand the verse, with Chrysostom, and most of the ancients and moderns, to refer to the <i>sins of uncleanness</i>, and continue vv. 4, 5:—<b>that he should not</b> (viz. <b>any of you</b>, repeated from “<i>every one of you</i>” above)<b> go beyond</b> (or <b>set at nought</b>, which perhaps is more strictly accurate; but the word means both, and the other is perhaps best in English) <b>and overreach his brother in the</b> (i.e. this) <b>matter </b>(viz. of acquiring his own vessel—that there should be among you no strifes on account of the <i>lusts of carnal desire</i>. The matter, viz. which is now in hand: not,—nor can the words by any possibility mean, “<i>any matter</i>,” as A.V.: nor “<i>the business of life</i>,” as some have interpreted it: see above. “It is probable that the obscurity of the passage arises partly from the decency in which the Apostle clothes it.” Jowett): <b>because God is the avenger</b> (<i>‘righter</i>,’ in such cases of setting at nought and overreaching) <b>of all these things</b> (viz. cases of <i>going beyond and overreaching</i>, and by inference, lustful sins like them), <b>as also</b> (see on ver. 5) <b>we before told you and (constantly) testified</b>.<h2><u><b>7.</b></u></h2> This verse (see above) is in my view decisive for the above rendering of ver.6. There is no mention here of <i>avarice</i>: nor is it possible to understand the word <b>uncleanness</b>, when ver. 3 has gone before, of any thing but carnal impurity.<h3><u><b>for</b></u></h3> <b>for the purpose of,—on condition of:—in</b>, ‘in the element of.’<br><br><b>sanctification</b> is the whole sphere of our Christian life. <h2><u><b>8.</b></u></h2> Hence, the sin of (rejecting) setting at nought such limitations and rules is a fearful one—no less than that of setting at nought God the giver of the Holy Spirit. In the words <b>despiseth </b> <b>not man</b> there is an obvious allusion to <i>going beyond and overreaching</i> above. There is no need to supply any thing after <b>despiseth: he that despiseth</b> simply describes him who commits the act of despising, <b>the despiser</b>—<i>what</i> he despises, is not to be supplied in the construction, but is clear from the context—viz. <i>his brother</i>.<h3><u><b>who also gave</b></u></h3> i.e. who also is the AUTHOR of our sanctification. <br><br>By the word <b>also</b> new force is given to the matter to be mentioned. It introduces a climax, whereby the sin is intensified. <br><br><b>gave</b>—not <i>giveth</i>—once for all, as being one great definite act of God by his Son.<h3><u><b>his Spirit, which is holy</b></u></h3> I have retained here the form of the original rather than<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18caCx2EQ614DwrP5qAVm25Q-Q4l-zGHz/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It conveys tacit but gentle reproof. The knowledge and the practice already exist: but the latter is not quite in pro- portion to the former. “In saying, ‘there is no need,’ he makes it greater than if he had said, ‘ there was need.’” Chrysostom.<h2><u><b>10.</b></u></h2> follows up the last verse by a matter of fact, shewing the teaching to have been in some measure effectual. <br><br><b>to abound</b>, viz. in this <i>love</i>. <br><br>There does not seem any reason, with Jowett, to ascribe the want of quietness, here implied,<b> to be quiet</b>, to their <i>uneasiness about the state of the dead</i>: much rather [as he also states: see below] to their mistaken anticipations of the immediate coming of the Lord. It would seem as if, notwithstanding their liberality to those without, there were some defect of diligence and harmony within which prompted this exhortation: see 2 Thess. iii. 11, 12. Theodoret assigns another reason for it: “This exhortation is not inconsistent with the foregoing praises. For the state of things was, that one party zealously ministered charity to the needy, and that the latter on account of this zealous ministration neglected their own duties: he naturally therefore praised the one and gave fitting advice to the others.” It has been objected to this, that thus the Church would be divided into two sections, the one exhorted to persist and abound in their liberality, the other to work diligently to support themselves ; whereas there is no trace in the text of such a division. But we may well answer, that instances are frequent enough of exhortations being addressed to whole churches which in their application would require severing and allotting to distinct classes of persons.<h2><u><b>11.</b></u></h2> <b>to study</b> (literally,<b> to make it your ambition</b>) <b>to be quiet</b>—have no other <i>ambition</i> than that of a quiet industrious holy life.

From those passages it appears, that we must not give the words a special application to their official life as deacons, but understand them of earnestness and singleness of Christian character: being in heart persuaded of the truth of that divine mystery which they profess to have apprehended by faith). <h2><u><b>10.</b></u></h2> <b>And moreover</b> (the <i>moreover</i> introduces a caution—the slight contrast of a necessary addition to their mere present character) let these (who answer, in their candidateship for the diaconate, to the above character) <b>be put to the proof first</b> (viz. with regard to their blamelessness of life, see the conditioning clause below: e.g. by testimonials, and publication of their intention to offer themselves: but no formal way is specified, only the reality insisted on); <b>then let them act as deacons</b> (or, simply, <i>let them</i> <i>minister</i>: but more probably here in the narrower technical sense), <b>if they are</b> (found by the <i>testing process</i> to be) <b>irreproachable.</b> <h2><u><b>11.</b></u></h2> (<b>The</b>) <b>women in like manner</b> (who are these? Are they (1) women who were to serve as deacons,—deaconesses?— or (2) wives of the deacons?— or (3) wives of the deacons and overseers ?—or (4) women in general? I conceive we may dismiss (4) at once, for Chrysostom’s reason: “ Why should he in the midst of writing on another subject insert any thing respecting <i>women</i> ?”—(3) upheld by Calvin and others, may for the same reason, seeing that he returns to the deacons again in ver. 12, be characterized as extremely improbable : —(2) has found many supporters among modern Commentators: and it is the rendering of the A. V. But it has against it(<i>a</i>) the omission in the original of all expressed reference to the deacons: (<i>b</i>) the expression <b>in like manner</b>, by which the <i>deacons</i> themselves were introduced in ver. 8, and which seems to mark a new ecclesiastical class: (<i>c</i>) the introduction of the injunction respecting the deacons in ver. 12, as a new particular, which would hardly be if their wives had been mentioned before: (<i>d</i>) the circumstance connected with the mention of Phœbe as <i>deaconess</i> of the Church at Cenchreæ in Rom. xvi. 1, that unless these are deacon- esses, there would be among these injunctions no mention of an important class of persons employed as officers of the church. We come thus to consider (1), that these women are <i>deaconesses,— ministræ,</i> as Pliny calls them in his letter to Trajan [see note on Rom. xvi. 1]. In this view the ancients are as far as I know unanimous: and it is held by some of the ablest among the moderns. It is alleged against it—(a) that thus the return to the <i>deacons,</i> verse 12, would be harsh, or, as Conybeare says, “on that view the verse is most. unnaturally interpolated in the midst of the discussion concerning the deacons.” But the ready answer to this is found in Chrysostom’s view of ver. 12, that under the word deacons, and their household duties, he comprehends in fact both sexes under one: (b) that the existence of dea- conesses as an order in the ministry is after all not so clear. To this it might be answered, that even were they nowhere else mentioned, the present passage stands on its own grounds; and if it seemed from the context that such persons were indicated here, we should reason from this to the fact of their existence, not from the absence of other mention to their non-indication here. I decide then for (1): that these women are <i>deaconesses</i>) (<b>must be</b>) <b>grave, not slanderers</b> (corresponds to “<i>not doubletongued</i>” in the males, <i>slander</i> being the vice to which the female sex is more addicted.

(1) Very many, both ancients and moderns, understand it of a <i>degree of ecclesiastical preferment,</i> as that from the office of deacon to that of presbyter, and take “good” for a comparative. Against this is (a) the foreing of the word “<i>good ;</i>” (b) the improbability that such a rise upwards through the ecclesiastieal offices was known in the Apostle’s time: (c) the still greater unlikelihood, even if it were known, that he would propose as a motive to a deacon to fulfil his office well, the ambitions desire to rise out of it. (2)Some among the moderns, following Calvin and Luther, understand by it a high place of honour in the esteem of the church. Against this is (a) that there is not a more distinct reference made to the estimation of the church: (b) that thus again an unworthy motive would be set before the deacons: (c) that again [see below] “ <i>great boldness,</i>” or “<i>confidence,</i>” will not on this interpretation, bear any legitimate rendering: (d) the use of the past, they who served: see above. (3) Some take it <i>spiritually,</i> as meaning <i>progress in the faith</i>. But (a) the whole is of too objective a character thus to be interpreted of a merely subjective process—besides that (b) thus also we should require <i>“are serving,” present, instead of “served,” past.</i> (4) Theodoret and others understand it nearly as above—of the station or standing-place which the faithful deacon acquires before God, with reference to his own salvation. The opinions of these Commentators are, however, somewhat various as to the exact time to which the standing on this <i>standing-place</i> is to be referred. Theodoret refers it to the next life. Others understand that they procure to themselves a <i>good expectation of salvation : a standing- place,</i> i.e., in <i>this life, with reference</i> to the future one. I believe that the truth will be found by combining the two views. The past verb, <b>served,</b> as above stated, is used with reference to their finished course at that day. The term are obtain- ing transfers the scene to the present time. The <b>standing-place</b> is that which they are now securing for themselves, and will be found standing on at that day: belonging therefore in part to both periods, and not necessarily involving the idea of different degrees of blessedness, though that idea [see 1 Cor. iii. 15] is familiar to St. Paul,—but merely predicating the soundness of the ground on which these <i>deacons</i> will themselves stand), and much confidence (this also is variously understood, according as the <i>standing-place</i> is interpreted.

Any apparent discrepancy with that passage, from the Apostle here speaking of the laying on of <i>his own hands alone</i>, may be removed by regarding the Apostle as chief in the ordination, and the presbytery as his assistants, as is the case with Bishops at the present day. As to the attributing the gift to the <i>laying on of hands</i> as its agent, we can only appeal, against the Roman-Catholic expositors, to the whole spirit of St. Paul's teaching, as declaring that by such an expression he does not mean that the inward spiritual grace is operated merely and barely by the outward visible sign,—but is only asserting, in a mode of speech common to us all, that the solemn dedication by him of Timothy to God’s work, of which the laying on of his hands was the sign and seal, did bring with it gifts and grace for that work. In this sense, and in this alone, the gift came through <i>the laying on of hands</i>, that laying on being the concentrated and effective sign of the setting apart, and conveying in faith the answer, assumed by faith, to the prayers of the church. That the Apostle had <i>authority</i> thus to set apart, was necessary to the validity of the act, and thus to the reception of the grace:—but the authority did not <i>convey</i> the grace. I may just add that the ‘indelibility of orders” which Mack infers from this passage, is simply and directly refuted by it. If the <i>gift</i> <i>which was in him</i> required <i>stirring up</i>, if, as Chrysostom says, ‘it is in us to quench it, and to re-light it,’—then plainly it is not indelible). <h2><u><b>7.</b></u></h2> <b>For</b> (‘and there is reason for my thus exhorting thee, seeing that thou hast shewn a spirit inconsistent with the character of that <i>gift</i>.’ The particle is passed over by Ellicott) <b>God did not give</b> (when we were admitted to the ministry: not, ‘<i>hath not given</i>,’ as A. V., which loses the reference) us the spirit (not “<i>a spirit</i>:” see my Greek Test.) of cowardice (there is doubtless a touch of severity in the use of this word, putting before Timothy his timidity in such a light as to shame him); <b>but</b> (the spirit) <b>of power</b> (as opposed to the weakness implicd in cowardice), <b>and love</b> (as opposed to that false compliance with men, which shrinks from bold rebuke :—that lofty self-abandonment of love for others, which will even sacrifice repute, and security, and all that belongs to self, in the noble struggle to do men good), <b>and correction </b>(the original meaning of the word ‘admonition of others that they may become <b>sound-minded</b>,— must be retained, as necessary both on ac- count of usage, and on account of the context. It is this bearing bold testimony before others, from which Timothy appears to have shrunk: compare ver. 8. The word in after times became a common one for <i>discipline</i> or <i>ecclesiastical correction</i>. The making the word mean <i>a sound mind</i>, as A. V. and many Commentators, is surely not allowable, though Chrysostom puts it doubtfully as an alternative. The only way in which it can come virtually to that, is by supposing the <i>correction</i> to be exercised <i>by ourselves over ourselves</i>.

It is impossible to deny that the above personal reference does enter again and but I cannot believe it to be more than secondary.

What is there which the Apostle can be said to have entrusted to God?

So Theodoret: (f) <i>the faith and its proclamation to the world</i>. So Chrysostom, as an alternative: (g) the <i>apostolic office </i>which the Apostle regarded as a thing entrusted to him, a stewardship, 1 Cor. ix. V7 (h) the <i>faithful</i> who had been converted by him in the view of their having been <i>committed to him by Christ</i>: (i) his <i>own soul</i>, as entrusted to him by God. On all these, and this view of the <i>deposit</i> generally, I may remark that we may fairly be guided by the same words “<i>the trust which was committed to thee, keep</i>” in ver. 14 as to their sense here. As, in ver. 14, these words are said of the subject of the sentence, viz. Timothy, keeping a deposit entrusted to him,—so here they must he said of the subject of the sentence, viz. God, keeping a deposit entrusted to Him. Otherwise, while keeping the mere word <b>deposit</b> to the same formal meaning in both places, we shall, most harshly and unnaturally, be requiring the phrase to bear, in two almost consecutive verses, two totally different meanings. The analogy therefore of ver. 14, makes the second group of meanings entirely against it, and in fact necessitates the adoption of the first alternative, viz. the objective genitive,—and the <i>deposit committed by the Apostle to God</i>. And when we enquire what this deposit was, we have the reply, I conceive, in the previous words <b>whom I have trusted</b>. He had entrusted HIMSELF, body, soul, and spirit, to the keeping of his heavenly Father, and lay safe in his hands, confident of His abiding and effectual care. A strong confirmation of this view is gained from 1 Thess. v. 23. In an English <i>version</i>, it is necessary to adopt one or other of the alternatives, for the sake of perspicuity. I have therefore retained the words of the A. V.) <b>against</b> (in a temporal sense: not simply <i>‘until’</i>) <b>that day</b> (viz. the day of Christ’s appearing ; see especially ch. iv. 8). <h2><u><b>13.</b></u></h2> The utmost care is required, in interpreting this verse, to ascertain the probable meaning of the words in reference to the context. On the right appreciation of this depends the question whether they are to be taken in their strict meaning, and simple grammatical sense, or to be forced to some possible but far-fetched rendering. The consideration depends very much on the collocation and meaning of the words in the original, and can hardly be represented to the English reader. I have argued in my Greek Testament that the ordinary rendering as in A. V., “<i>Hold fast the form of sound words</i>,” is absolutely untenable. The verb does not mean “<i>hold fast</i>,’ but is simply “<b>have</b>,” or “<b>take</b>,” and it is not “<i>the</i> form,” but ‘<b>a form</b>,” or “<b>a sample</b>.” This being so, we shall have the rendering so far,—<b>Have</b> (take) <b>an example of</b> (the) <b>sound words, which thou heardest of me in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</b> Then two questions arise for us: to what (1) does <b>take an example</b> refer? I answer,—to the saying immediately preceding, “<i>I know whom I have trusted</i>,” <i>&c</i>. This was one of those<i> faithful </i>or<i> wholesome sayings</i>, of which we hear so often in these Epistles; one which in his timidity, Timothy was perhaps in danger of forgetting, and of which therefore the Apostle reminds him, and bids him take it as a specimen or pattern of those sound words which had been committed to him by his father in the faith. To what (2) do the words <b>in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus</b> refer?

He has held up to Timothy, as an example, his own boldness and constancy: and has given him a sample of the faithful sayings which ruled his own conduct, in ver.12. He proceeds to speak of a few of the discouragements under which in this confidence he was bearing up: and, affectionate gratitude prompting him, and at the same time hy way of an example of fidelity to Timothy, he dilates on the exception to the general dereliction of him which had been furnished by Onesiphorus.—<b>Thou knowest this, that all who are in Asia </b>(it does not follow, as Chrysostom says, that “it was probable that there were then present in Rome many from divers parts of Asia:” but he uses the expression with reference to him to whom he was writing, who was in the proconsular Asia) <b>turned away from me</b> (not as A. V., ‘are turned away from me’ [perfect]: the act referred to took place at a stated time, and from what follows, that time appears to have been on occasion of a visit to Rome. They were ashamed of Paul the prisoner, and did not seek him out, see ch. iv. 16: “they avoided the society of the Apostle from fear of Nero,” Theodoret : but perhaps not so much from this motive, as from the one hinted at in the praise of Onesiphorus below. The <b>all</b> must of course apply to all of whom the Apostle <i>had had trial</i> [and not even those without exception, vv. 16—18]: the A. V. gives the idea, that a general apostasy of all in Asia from St. Paul had taken place.

Some indeed take it as merely an extension of the gratitude of the Apostle from Onesiphorus to his household: but ch. iv. 19 is against this. ‘Theodoret indeed and Chrysostom understand that Onesiphorus was <i>with him </i>at this time: but the words here [e. g., <i>when he came to Rome</i>] will hardly allow that), <b>because on many occasions he refreshed me</b> (any kind of refreshing, of body or mind, may be implied), <b>and was not ashamed of</b> (ver. 8) <b>my chain </b>(my condition of a prisoner): <b>but when he came to Rome, sought me out the more diligently</b> (he did not shrink<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oX3_ZqSsDOZR1hUbqfskBgrzdCy0UIHt/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But he forgets that these two methods of teaching are in fact but one and the same. <i>Scripture</i> has been <i>God’s way of fixing tradition</i>, and rendering it trustworthy at any distance of time; of obviating the very danger which in this Epistle we see so imminent, viz. of one of those teachers, who were links in this chain of transmission, becoming inefficient and transmitting it inadequately. This very Epistle is therefore a warning to us not to trust oral tradition, seeing that it was so dependent on men, and to accept no way of conserving it but that which God’s providence has pointed out to us in the canonical books of Scripture.<h2><u><b>3</b>.</u></h2> <b>Suffer hardship with me</b> (“<i>me</i>” is not expressed in the Greek. The word signifies, as Conybeare happily renders it, «Take thy <i>share</i> in suffering.’ The mention of the share binds it to what pre- cedes and follows, referring primarily to the Apostle himself, though doubtless having a wider reference to all who similarly suffer: see above, on the connexion of ver. 2) <b>as a good soldier of Jesus Christ</b>. <h2><u>4.</u></h2> <b>No soldier when on service is </b>(suffers himself to be: ‘is,’ as his normal state) <b>entangled in the businesses of life; that he may please him who called him to be a soldier </b>(who originally enrolled him as a soldier: the word signifies <i>to levy soldiers</i>, or <i>raise a troop</i>, and “<i>he who chose him to be a soldier</i>,” designates the commander of such troop.—The taking of these precepts according to the letter, to signify that no minister of Christ may have a secular occupation, is quite beside the purpose: for 1) it is not ministers, but all soldiers of Christ who are spoken of : 2) the position of the verb shews that it is not the fact of the <i>existence</i> of such occupation, but the being <i>entangled</i> in it, which is before the Apostle’s mind: 3) the Apostle’s own example sufficiently confutes such an idea. Only then does it become unlawful, when such occupation, from its engrossing the man, becomes a hindrance to the work of the ministry,—or from its nature is incompatible with it).<h2><u><b>5</b>.</u></h2> The soldier must serve on condition of not dividing his service: now we have another instance of the same requirement: and in the conflicts of the arena there are certain laws, without the fulfilment of which no man can obtain the victory. <b>But</b> (the above is not the only example, but) <b>if any one also </b>(i.e. to give another instance) <b>strive in the games</b> (it is necessary to adopt a circumlocution for the verb used, “<i>be an athlete</i>.’ That of A.V., ‘<i>strive for masteries</i>, is not definite enough, omitting all mention of the games, and by consequence not even suggesting them to the ordinary reader), <b>he is not crowned</b> (even in case of his gain- ing the victory? or is the word inclusive of all efforts made to get the crown,—‘he has no chance of the crown?’ rather the former), <b>unless he have striven</b> (this seems to assume the getting of the vic-<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQPHH551xmdpKghyZ_Ws7Wv1OPOxcICj/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The saying is akin to that of not muzzling the ox while treading out the corn:—the right of first participation in the harvest belongs to him who is labouring in the field: do not. thou therefore, by relaxing this labour, forfeit that right.

The Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ were two truths especially imperiled, and indeed denied, by their teaching. At the same time these very<br><br>truths, believed and persisted in, furnished him with the best grounds for steadfastness in his testimony to the Gospel, and attachment to the Apostle himself, suffering for his faithfulness to them: and on his adherence to these truths depended his share in that Saviour in whom they were manifested, and in union with whom, in His eternal and unchangeable truth, our share in blessedness depends. <b>Keep in remembrance Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David</b> (the abrupt, and otherwise unaccountable sequence of these clauses, has been supposed to spring from their being parts of a recognized and technical profession of faith), <b>according to my Gospel</b> (‘the Gospel entrusted to me to teach.

But neither 1) is this sound logic, nor 2)is it in accordance with the Apostle’s usage of the expression “<i>for this cause that</i>.” 1) The fact, that the word of God is not bound, is clearly not the reason why he suffers these things for the elect: nor can we say with Huther, that the <i>consciousness</i> of this fact is that in which he endures all. De Wette takes the predominant idea to be, the dispersion and success of God’s word, in and by which the Apostle is encouraged to suffer. But this would render the connexion very loose. 2) In 1 Tim. i. 16, and Philem. 15, the reference of “<i>for this cause</i>” is evidently to <i>what follows</i>: compare also Rom. iv. 16, 2 Cor. xiii. 10. I would therefore refer the words to the following, and consider them, as in the above instances, as a marked way of indicating the reason presently to be given: ‘for this purpose, ... that;’ so Chrysostom and others) <b>I endure all things</b> (not merely suffer [objective]: but readiness and persistence [subjective] are implied in the word, and the universal <i>all things</i> belongs to this subjective meaning—‘ I am enduring, ready to bear, all things’) <b>for the sake of the elect </b>(see especially Tit. i. 1. The Apostle does not refer merely to those elect of God who are not yet converted, but generally to the whole category, both those who are already turned to him, and those who are yet to be turned: compare the parallel declaration in Col. i. 24), <b>that they also</b> (as well as ourselves with reference to what is to follow, the certainty that we, who suffer with Him, shall reign with Him) <b>may obtain the salvation which is in </b>(as its element and condition of ex- istence) <b>Christ Jesus with eternal glory</b> (salvation here, in its spiritual presence and power—“<i>by grace ye have been saved</i>,” Eph. ii. 6: and glory hereafter, the full development and expansion of salvation, Rom. viii. 21). <b>Faithful is the saying</b> (another of those current Christian sayings, probably the utterances originally of the Spirit by those who spoke <i>prophecies</i> in the Church—and, as in 1 Tim. iii. 16, bearing with it so much of balance and rhythmical arrangement, as to seem to be a portion of some hymn): <b>For</b> (Chrysostom and others regard this <b>for</b> as rendering a reason why the <i>saying is faithful</i>, understanding <i>faithful is the saying</i> of what has <i>gone before</i>, viz. the certainty that <i>he who obtains salvation shall also win eternal glory</i>. But this is most unnatural. The <b>for</b> is not merely explicative, but as in 1 Tim. iv. 9, renders a reason for the assertion that the <i>saying is faithful</i>,—in the declaration of the fact in well-known words: for the fact is so, that if &c.) <b>if we died with Him</b> (pointing to <i>some one definite event</i>: the reference must be to that participation in Christ’s death which takes place <i>at baptism </i>in all those who are His, and which those who follow Him in sufferings emphatically shew that they then did really take on them: see Rom. vi. 3, 4,8: Col. ii. 12, Certainly if the past tense stood alone, it might be taken as <i>anticipatory</i>, looking back on life from that future day in which the <i>living with</i> <i>him</i> will be realized : but coupled as it is with the <i>present</i>, “<i>we endure</i>,” and the future, “<i>we shall deny</i>,” we can hardly take it otherwise than literally as to time, of an event already past, and if so, strictly as in the parallel Rom. vi. 8, where the reference is clear), <b>we shall also live with Him</b> (hereafter in glory): <b>if we endure </b>(with Him: see Rom. viii. 17), <b>we shall also reign with Him </b>(sce Rom. vy. 17; viii. 17.

In this place, these last days are set before Timothy as being on their way, and indeed their premonitory symptoms already appearing.

It may be so, in the deeper ground of the psychological reason for this their fickle and imperfect condition: but I should rather think that the Apostle here indicates their character as connected with the fact of their captivity to these teachers.—With regard to the fact itself, we have abundant testimony that the Gnostic heresy in its progress, as indeed all new and strange systems, laid hold chiefly of the female sex: see the instances quoted in my Greek Test. De Wette remarks, “ This is an admirable characterization of zealous soul-hunters (who have been principally found, and are still found, among the Roman Catholics) and their victims. We must not however divide the different traits among different classes or individuals: it is their combination only which is characteristic.’” “One would say,” says Calvin, “that Paul was here designedly painting the portraiture of the life of the cloister”).<h2><u><b>8.</b></u></h2> <b>But</b> (i.e. it is no wonder that there should be now such opponents to the truth, for their prototypes existed also in ancient times) <b>as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses</b> (these are believed to be traditional names of the Egyptian magicians mentioned in Exod. vii. 11, 22. Origen says, “That which we read in St. Paul, ‘Jannes and Mambres withstood Moses,’ is not found in the public Scriptures, but in a secret book inscribed ‘ Jannes and Mambres,’ but Theodoret’s account is more probable, that St. Paul learnt their names, not out of the Holy Scriptures, but from the unwritten teaching of the Jews,” especially as the names are found in the Targum of Jonathan on Exod. vii. 11; xxii. 22. The traditional history of Jannes and Jambres, collected out of the rabbinical books, is as follows: They were the sons of Balaam— prophesied to Pharaoh the birth of Moses, in consequence of which he gave the order for the destruction of the Jewish children, —and thenceforward appear as the counsellors of much of the evil,—in Egypt, and in the desert, after the Exodus,—which happened to Israel. They were variously reported to have perished in the Red Sea, or to have been killed in the tumult consequent on the making the golden calf, which they had advised), <b>thus these also withstand the truth: being men corrupted in mind, worthless </b>(not abiding the test, reprobate) <b>concerning the faith</b> (in respect of the faith). <h2><u>9.</u></h2> <b>Notwithstanding, they shall not advance further</b> (im ch. ii. 16, it is said, “<i>they shall advance </i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_mZhPaIY_W9jbfa3SWg5vRJ_gDjUzQcI/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Whereas the <i>perfect</i>, as in A. V., would imply that the example had been really ever before him, and followed up to the present moment: and so would weaken the necessity of the exhortation) <b>my teaching, conduct, purpose</b> (Ellicott remarks, that in all other passages in St. Paul’s Epistles, this word <b>purpose</b> is used with reference to God),<b> faith, longsuffering</b> (“his bearing with the offences of the brethren,” Theodoret: or perhaps, as Chrysostom,—“his patience in respect of the false teachers and the troubles of the time”), <b>love</b> (“which they had not,” Chrysostom), <b>endurance</b> (or patience: “how generously I bear the attacks of my enemies,” 'heodoret), <b>persecutions</b> (“to these <i>endurance</i> furnished the note of transition,” Huther), <b>sufferings</b> (not only was I persecuted, but the persecution issued in infliction of suffering), <b>such</b> (suf- ferings) <b>as befell mein Antioch (of Pisidia), in Iconium, in Lystra</b> (why should these be especially enumerated? Theodoret as- signs as a reason, “ Omitting mention of other dangers, he speaks only of those which happened to him in Pisidia and Lycaonia. For he to whom he was writing was a Lycaonian, and these incidents were better known to him than the rest.” And so Chrysostom, and many both ancient and modern, It may be so, doubtless: and this reason, though rejected by De Wette and others, seems much better to suit the context and probability, than the other, given by Huther, that these persecutions were the first which befell the Apostle in his missionary work among the heathen. It is objected to it, that during the former of these persecutions Timothy was not with St. Paul. But the answer to that is easy. At the time of his conversion, they were recent, and the talk of the churches in those parts: and thus, especially with our rendering, and the indefinite past sense of “<i>thou followedst</i>,” would be naturally mentioned, as being those sufferings of the Apostle which first excited the young convert’s attention to make them his own pattern of what he too must suffer for the Gospel’s sake. Baur and De Wette regard the <i>exact correspondence</i> with the Acts (xiii. 50; xiv. 5, 19; xvi. 3] as a suspicious cir- cumstance.

The former is followed by Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, Athanasius, Estius, Calvin, &e.,and by the A.V. The latter by Origen, Theodoret, by Grotius, Erasmus, &c., and the ancient Syriac version, the Latin Vulgate, and Luther.

It is then very possible,that the Apostle might, wish to exalt the dignity of the Scripture by asserting of it that it was <i>inspired by God</i>, and then out of this lofty predicate might unfold that it <i>was also profitable</i>, &c. ;—its various uses in the spiritual life. On the other hand it may be urged, that, thus the two epithets do not hang naturally together, the first consisting of the one word <i>God-inspired</i>, and the other being expanded into a whole sentence: especially as in order at all to give symmetry to the whole, the end stated in ver. 17 must be understood as the purposed result of the <i>inspiration</i> as well as of the <i>profit</i> of the Scriptures, which is hardly natural: (b) the requirements of the grammatical construction: see in my Greek Test.—I own on the whole the balance seems to me to incline on the side of (2), unobjectionable as it is in construction, and of the two, better suited to the context. I therefore follow it, hesitatingly, I confess, but feeling that: it is not to be lightly overthrown. <b>Every Scripture</b> (not ‘every writing :’ the word never occurs in the New Test. except in the sense of ‘Scripture.’ It may mean, perhaps, all Scripture: but, in the presence of such an expression as “another Scripture saith,” John xix. 37, it is safer to keep to the meaning, unobjectionable both gram- matically and contextually, ‘every Scripture’—i. e, ‘every part of Scripture’) <b>given by inspiration of God</b> (this word <i>inspired</i>, like that in the Greek, is an expression and idea connected with <i>breath</i>, the power of the divine Spirit being conceived of as a breath of life: the word thus amounts to ‘breathed through,’ ‘full of the Spirit” It (the idea) is common to Jews, Greeks, and Romans. Josephus speaks of the prophets as having learnt according to the <i>afflatus</i> (breathing into them) from God. Plato and Plutarch speak of <i>inspired wisdom and inspired dreams</i>; Cicero says, “No one ever was a great man without some divine afflatus.” “Inspired” is first found as a predicate of persons: compare Matt. xxii. 43; 2 Pet. i, 21: then it was also applied to things. On the meaning of the word as applied to the Scriptures, see Introd. to Vol. I. ‘On the inspiration of the Gospels.’ As applied to the prophets, the sense would not materially differ, except “that we ever regard one speaking <i>prophecy</i>, strictly so called, as more immediately and thoroughly the mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit, seeing that the future is wholly hidden from men, aud God does not in this case use or inspire <i>human testimony to facts</i>, but suggests <i>the whole substance </i>of what is said, <i>direct</i> from Himself) <b>is also</b> (besides this its quality of inspiration : on the construction, see above)<b> profitable for</b> (towards) <b>teaching</b> (this, the <i>teaching of the person</i> reading the Scriptures, not the <i>making him a teacher</i>, is evidently the meaning.

For fountains flow, even if no one draw from them: and rivers run, though no one drinks. So too the preacher ought, even if no one attend to him, to fulfil all his own duty; for our rule, who have taken in hand the ministry of the word, is laid down by God the lover of men, that his part is never to slacken, nor to be silent, whether men hear, or pass by.” This latter passage gives the more correct reference,—not so much to <i>his</i> opportunities, as the former, but to theirs); <b>convict, rebuke, exhort; in</b> (not <i>‘with</i>,’ it is not the <i>accompaniment</i> of the actions, but the clement, the temper in which they are to be performed) <b>all</b> (possible) <b>longsuffering and doctrine</b> (not subjective ‘<i>perseverance in teaching</i>,’ as Conybeare ; but <i>‘doctrine’</i> itself: it [objective] is to be the clement in which these acts take place, as well as <i>longsuffering</i> {subjective}.

V., is quoted, “where Esther says concerning Artaxerxes, Put a word into my mouth <i>before the lion</i>.’ Whitby: —or, seeing that according to the chronology adopted by some, Nero was not in Rome at the time [see Introd. to Pastoral Epistles, § ii. 33], of his <i>locum tenens</i>, <i>Ælius Cæsareanus</i>,—or of the <i>Jewish accuser</i>. But these are hardly probable: nor again is it, that the Apostle was literally in danger of being thrown to wild beasts, and established his right as a Roman citizen to be exempted from that punishment: nor again is the idea, that the expression is figurative for <i>great danger,—the jaws of death</i>, or the like: for the Apostle <i>did not fear</i> death, but: looked forward to it as the end of his course, and certainly would not have spoken of it under this image. The <i>context</i> seems to me to demand another and very different interpretation. None stood with him—all forsook him: but the Lord stood by him and strengthened him: <i>for what</i>? that he might <i>witness a good confession</i>, and that the <i>preaching</i> might be expanded to the utmost. The result of this strengthening was, that he was delivered <i>from the mouth of the lion</i>: he was strengthened, w<i>itnessed a good confession, in spite of desertion and discouragement.</i> Then let us pass on to his confidence for the future, the expression of which is bound on to this sentence by the same verb, <b>shall deliver me</b>, indicating the identity of God’s deliverance, —and “<b>from every</b> evil work,” indicating the <i>generalization of the danger of which this was a particular case</i>. And how is the danger generally described? as “every <b>evil work</b>:” and it is implied that the falling into such danger would preclude him from enduring to Christ’s heavenly kingdom. It was then an <i>evil work</i> from which he was on this occasion delivered. What <i>evil work</i>? <i>The falling into the power of the tempter</i>; the giving way, in his own weakness and the desertion of all, and betraying the Gospel for which he was. sent as a witness. The <i>lion</i> then is the <i>devil</i> ; “who goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,” 1 Pet.v. 8).<h2><u><b>18.</b></u></h2> <b>The Lord</b> (Jesus) <b>shall deliver me from every evil work </b>(sce above: from every danger of faint-heartedness, and apostasy. The meaning adopted by some, that the <i>evil works</i> are the <i>works of his adversaries</i> plotting against him, is totally beside the purpose: he had no such confidence (ver. 6), nor would his conservation to Christ’s heavenly kingdom depend in the least upon such deliverance. Besides which, the correspondence of this declaration of confidence to the concluding petition of the Lord’s Prayer cannot surely be fortuitous, and then <i>evil</i>, here joined to <i>work</i> as neuter, must be subjective, evil resulting from our <i>falling</i> into temptation, not evil happening to us from without), <b>and shall preserve me safe</b> (shall <b>save</b> <i>me</i>: but in its not uncommon, pregnant sense of ‘bring safe’) <b>unto his kingdom in heaven</b> (though it may be conceded to De Wette that this expression is not otherwise found in St. Paul, it is one to which his existing expressions easily lead on: e.g.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/161vVy0o2te2uxPnTQb08Zuc-60K-zgkL/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It would seem to be an axiom with some critics, that a writer can never use an expression once only.

Besides, the petition of the Lord’s Prayer having been transferred to our Lord as its fulfiller [compare John xiv. 13, 14], the doxology, which seems to have come into liturgical use almost as soon as the prayer itself, would naturally suggest a corresponding doxology here).<h2><u><b>19—21</b>.</u></h2> <i>Salutations and notices.</i> <b>Sa- Inte Prisca and Aquila </b>(see notes, Acts xviii. 2: Rom. xvi. 3), <b>and the house of Onesiphorus </b>(himself probably deceased.

Thus, as there God is said to have given us grace in Christ from eternal ages, meaning that the gift took place as the result of a divine purpose fixed from eternity, so here He is said to have promised eternal life before eternal times, meaning that the promise took place as the result of a purpose fixed from eternity); <h2><u><b>3</b>.</u></h2> <b>but</b> (contrast to the eternal and hidden purpose, and to the promise, just mentioned) <b>made manifest in its own seasons</b> (not, ‘<i>His own seasons</i>:’ —the times belonging to it,—fixed by Him for the manifestation) <b>His word</b> (we naturally expect the same object as before, viz. <i>eternal life</i>: but we have instead, <i>His word</i>,—i. e. the Gospel, see Rom. xvi. 25) <b>in</b> (as the element or vehicle of its manifesta- tion) <b>the proclamation</b> (see 2 Tim. iv. 17), <b>with which I was entrusted according to </b>(in pursuanee of) <b>the command of our Saviour God;</b> <h2><u><b>4</b>.</u></h2> <b>to Titus</b> (see Introd. § i.), my true (genuine, see on 1 Tim. i, 2) <b>child according to</b> (in respect of, or agreeably to, in conformity with the ap- pointed spread and spiritually generative power of that faith) <b>the common faith </b>(common to us both and to all the people of God: hardly as Grotius, ‘to Jews, such as Paul, and Greeks such as Titus for there is no hint of such a distinction being brought out in this Epistle): <b>Grace and peace from God the Father</b> (see on 1 Tim. i, 2) <b>and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</b><h2><u>5—9.</u></h2> <i>Reason stated for Titus being left in Crete—to appoint elders in its cities.

He was sent for to Athens to undertake the purification of the city from the pollution occasioned by Cylon (see articles ‘Epimenides’ and ‘Cylon,’ in the Dict. of Biography and Mythology), and is said to have lived to an extreme old age, and to have been buried at Lacedæmon. The appellation <i>‘prophet’</i> seems to have belonged to him in its literal sense: Cicero describes him as one of those who in an excitement of mind, or by its free motion, foretold future events: and Apuleius calls him an illustrious declarer of the fates, and a poet. And Diogenes Laertius tells us that the Cretans sacrificed to him as a god.—On the character here given of the Cretans, see Introd. to this Epistle, § ii. 9 ff. <b>slothful bellies</b> is said of those who by indulging their bodily appetites have become corpulent and indolent).<h2><u><b>13</b>.</u></h2> <b>This testimony is true.

I. 1 – II. 18.</u></h1> </b>AFTER MANIFOLD REVELATIONS IN FORMER TIMES, GOD HAS NOW REVEALED HIMSELF TO US IN HIS SON (i, 1–4), WHO IS GREATER THAN THE ANGELS, THE DISPENSERS OF THE LAW (i, 4—14; inference, ii, 1–4), THOUGH FOR A TIME HE WAS MADE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS, AND SUBJECTED TO SUFFERINGS, IN ORDER TO BE, AS OUR HIGH PRIEST, OUR RECONCILER TO GOD (ii. 5–18). And herein (i. 1–4), <i>introduction and statement of position.</i><br><br>We may notice, 1. The opening of this Epistle without any address, or mention of the Author. Various reasons have been assigned for this, and inferences drawn from it (see Introduction). Some have said that the matter to be treated was so weighty, that the Writer merged altogether his own personality, and trusted to the weight of his subject to gain him a hearing. But this would not account for entire omission of the name of the man and his standing. Some have therefore imagined that another shorter letter of a more private nature must have accompanied this. But we may reply, that this idea derives no countenance from the phænomena of the Epistle itself, containing as it does at the end private notices which might well have been dispensed with, if such a commendatory Epistle had accompanied it. We must therefore deal with this circumstance without any such hypothesis to help us. On the supposition of the authorship by St. Paul, some account may be given of it,—viz. that the name of the Apostle was concealed, from the nature of the relations between himself, and those to whom he was writing (see this hypothesis examined in the Introduction). And on the idea of <i>superintendence</i> by St. Paul, it would obviously admit of the same solution. 2. The carefully balanced and rhetorical style in which the Epistle begins, characteristic indeed of its whole diction, but especially marking this first period (vv. 1–4), The clauses are joined by close grammatical and rhetorical dependence: there is no breaking off, and no carelessness of construction, but all is most carefully and skilfully disposed.<h2><u><b>1.</u></h2> In many portions</b> (or ‘parts,’ manifoldly as regards the <i>distribution</i>. “For not <i>all</i> things, nor <i>the same</i> things, were revealed to all the prophets, but the parts of great mysteries were distributed among them. E.g., Isaiah was inspired to foretell Christ’s birth from a virgin, and His Passion: Daniel, the time of His Advent: Jonah, His burial: Malachi, the coming of His Forerunner. And again some had more, others less, revealed to them.” Estius, <i>‘At sundry times’</i> (A.V.) is not an accurate rendering, nor can it he said to <i>express</i> the meaning: <i>time</i> is a historical condition of the sequence of parts,—<i>persons to whom,</i> an anthropological condition,—but it does not follow that <i>‘at sundry times’</i> or <i>‘to sundry persons,’ gives the force of ‘in divers parts:’</i> because it might be the same thing which was revealed again and again. This revelation in portions, by fragments, in and by various persons, was necessarily an imperfect revelation, to which the one final manifestation in and by One Person<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYMlbODoioLLOy-UPeLkBK78LCDpLit1/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Isaiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel saw differing forms of vision.” Theodoret. Bleek remarks, that in Numb. xii. 6—8, the diversity of manner of revelation is recognized : dreams and visions being set beneath that open speaking, mouth to mouth, which the Lord used towards His servant Moses. It will be seen, that I cannot agree with Chrysostom and many others in regarding the two adverbs as a mere rhetorical redundance,—meaning merely, “ differently.” Both set forth the imperfection of the Old Test. revelations. They were various in nature and in form: fragments of the whole truth, presented in manifold forms, in shifting hues of separated colour: Christ is the full revelation of God, Himself the pure light, uniting in His one Person the whole spectrum: see below on ver. 3) <b>in time past</b> (generally interpreted of the Old Test. period, ending with Malachi. But there is no need for cutting off the period there. In the interim between Malachi and the Writer’s time, though the Old Test. canon was closed, we cannot say that God’s manifold revelations of Himself had absolutely ceased. Nay, strictly speaking, the Baptist himself be- longed to the former, though he pointed on to the latter period. No doubt he was not here in the Writer’s view, and the period of former revelations is here regarded as distinct from the final Christian one: but for all that, we must not put an artificial terminus where he puts none) <b>God having spoken to the fathers</b> (so in reff. The term <i>“the fathers”</i> is absolutely used in John vii. 22; Acts xiii. 32; Rom. ix. 5; xi. 28; xv. 8; 2 Pet. iii. 4. It is evident from this term being common to the Writer and his readers, where no reference is made to Jews in the context [as in Rom. ix. 5], that he was writing as 4 Jew and to Jews) <b>in</b> (not equivalent to <i>“by,”</i> though it includes it. The <b>in</b> designates the <i>element in which</i> the <i>speaking</i> takes place, and holds therefore its own proper force. God spoke <i>in</i> the prophets, being resident in them. Bengel draws a distinction,—a human king speaks by his ambassadors, but not in them) <b>the prophets </b>(to be taken here apparently in the wider sense,—as including not only those whose inspired writings form the Old Test. canon, but all who were vehicles of the divine self-manifestation to the Fathers. Thus Enoch in Jude 14 is said to have <i>prophesied</i>. Moses is of course included, and indeed would on any view be the <i>chief</i> of those here spoken of, seeing that by him the greater part of God’s revelation of Himself to the fathers was made).<h2><u><b>2.</u></h2> at the end of these days</b> (in order to understand this expression, it will be well to call to mind certain Jewish modes of speaking of time. The Rabbis divided the whole of time into <i>“this age,”</i> and <i>“the age to come.”</i> The days of the Messiah were regarded as a period of transition from the former to the latter,—His appearance, as the ushering in of the termination of <i>“these days,”</i> the beginning of the end,— and His second coming in glory as the accomplishment of <i>“these days”</i> or <i>“this age.”</i> And with this, New Test. usage agrees,—see 1 Pet. i. 20; James v. 3; Jude 18; 2 Pet. iii. 3. Thus <b>at the end of these days</b> would mean, ‘at the end of <i>this age,’</i> in the technical sense of these words as signifying the whole world-period, the latter boundary of which is the Resurrection. And thus is the manifestation of Christ in the flesh ever spoken of, and especially in this Epistle; compare ch. ix. 26; and notes on ch. ii. 5; vi.5. Stuart has mistaken the meaning, in rendering <i>‘during the last dispensation,’</i> and making <i>“these”</i> to import that the period had already <i>begun</i>. It is not of a beginning, but of an <i>expiring</i> period, the Writer is speaking. The ancient expositors principally use these words as ground of <i>consolation:</i> those who were in conflict would be consoled on hearing that it was soon to end) <b>spake</b> (not <i>‘hath spoken:’</i> the <b>end</b> just spoken of is looked back on as a definite point, at which the divine revelation took place. The attention of the readers is thus directed not so much to the present state in which they are, as to the act of God towards them) <b>unto us</b> (i.e. all who have heard that voice, or to whom it is to be announced. There is no distinction between those who received God’s revelation immediately from the Son, and those who received immediately through others. <br><br><b>To this latter</b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/158rIGjRssLj22-VAw0MgWkvMtoWpmZVZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

We now pass off into a description of the dignity, and person, and work, of this Son of God: which description ends in asserting and proving Him to be higher than angels, the loftiest of created beings) <b>whom He constituted</b> (not, <i>“hath constituted,”</i> or <i>“appointed :”</i> referring, as also does <b>made</b>, which follows, to the time, <i>“in the beginning,”</i>—the date of the eternal counsel of God) <i>heir</i> (“appropriately, after the mention of <i>Sonship</i>, comes <i>inheritance.”</i> Bengel. <b>That heir</b> is not equivalent to <i>“lord”</i> simply, is plain: the same expression could not have been used of the Father. It is in virtue of the Sonship of our Lord that the Father constituted Him heir of all things, before the worlds began. “In Him also,” says Delitzsch, “culminates the fulfilment of the promise given to the seed of Abraham, that he should be heir of the world.” See below. See for St. Paul’s use of the word and image, Gal. iv. 7) <b>of all things</b> (“that is, of the whole world.” Chrysostom. And we cannot give this a more limited sense, nor restrict it to this world ; especially as the subsequent portion of the chapter distinctly includes the angels in it. It is much disputed whether this heirship of Christ is to be conceived as belonging to Him essentially in his divine nature, or as accruing to Him from his work of redemption in the human nature. The Fathers, and the majority of the moderns, decide for the latter alternative. “The Lord Christ is the heir of all things,” says Theodoret, “not as God, but as man.” And so the Socinian and quasi-Socinian interpreters, arriving at the same view by another way, not believing the præ-existence of Christ. But it is plain that such an interpretation will not snit the requirements of the passage. For this humiliation of His, with its effects, first comes in at the end of ver. 3. All this, now adduced, is referable to his essential Being as Son of God; not merely in the Godhead before his Incarnation, but also in the Manhood after it, which no less formed a part of His “constitution” by the Father, thin His Godhead itself, So that the word <i>“constituted”</i> or <i>“appointed,”</i> as observed above, must be taken not as an appoint- ment in prospect of the Incarnation, but as an absolute appointment, coincident with the <i>“this day have I begotten Thee,”</i> belonging to the eternal Sonship of the Lord, though wrought out in full by his mediatorial work), <b>by whom</b> (by means of whom, as His acting Power and personal instrument : so Theophylact : “Since the Father is the cause of the Son, He is also of the things which were made by Him. The Father, who begat the Son their maker, seems to make them Himself”) <b>He also made</b> (<i>created</i>. The word brought into emphasis by <b>also</b> is not <i>the world</i>, but <b>made</b>. “He not only appointed the Son heir of all things, before the Creation; but He also <i>made</i> the worlds by Him.” Bengel) <b>the ages</b> (so literally; but the meaning of the term has been much disputed. ‘The main classes of interpreters are two. (1) Those who see in the word its ordinary meaning of <i>‘an age of time:’</i> (2) those who do not recognize such meaning, but suppose it to have been merged in that of <i>“the world,”</i> or <i>“the worlds.”</i> To (1) belong the Greek Fathers; and. some: others. On the other hand, (2) is the view of the majority of Commentators. It is explained and defended at length by Bleek, none of whose examples however seem to me to be void of the same ambiguity which characterizes the expression here. The Jews, it appears, came at length to designate by their phrase, “the present age,” not only the present age, but all things in and belonging to it—and so of the “future age” likewise. He therefore would regard <b>the ages</b> as strictly parallel with <i>“all things”</i> above, and would in- terpret, ‘Whom He has constituted lord, possessor and ruler over all, over the whole world, even as by Him He has made all, the universe,’ And nearly so Delitzsch, Ebrard, and Lünemann: these two latter adding however somewhat, inasmuch as they take it of all this state of things constituted in time and space. And this last view I<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZavMDfMvps5f8B-EQI2wWlambkC-gBai/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

So that the universe, as well in its great primæval conditions,— the reaches of Space, and the ages of Time, as in all material objects and all successive events, which furnish out and people Space and Time, God made by Christ. It will be plain that what has been here said will apply equally to ch. xi. 3, which is commonly quoted as decisive for the <i>material</i> sense here. Some have endeavoured to refer <i>the ages</i> (3) to the new or spiritual world, or the ages of the Messiah, or of the Christian Church: principally in the interests of Socinianism: or (4), to the various dispensations of God’s revelation of Himself: or even (5), as Fabricius, to the Gnostic sons, or emanations from the divine Essence, and so to the higher spiritual order of beings, the angels. Against all these, besides other considerations, ch. xi. 3 is a decisive testimony). It will be seen by consulting the note on John i. 1, how very near the teaching of Philo approached to this creation of the universe by the Son.<h2><u><b>3.</u></h2></b> “The Son of God now becomes Himself the subject. The verb belonging to the relative <b>who</b> is not found till <i>‘sat down’</i> at the end of the verse. But the intermediate participial clauses do not stand in the same relation to the main sentence. The first members, <i>‘being, &c.,”</i> still set forth those attributes of the Son of God which are of a permanent character, and belonging to Him before the Incarnation: whereas the following member, the last participial clause, stands in nearer relation to the main sentence, expressing as it does the purification of mankind from sin, wrought by the incarnate Son of God, as one individual historical event,—as the antecedent of that exaltation of Him to the right hand of God, which the main sentence enounces.” Bleck.<br><br><b>Who</b> (this represents, it will be evident, rather the præ-existent than the incarnate Word. But it is perhaps a mistake to let this distinction be too prominent, and would lead to the idea of a change having taken place in the eternal relation of the Son to the Father, when He subjected himself to the conditions of space and time.

See Wisd. vii, 26, where wisdom is called “the brightness of the everlasting light.” And this (which, as Delitzsch remarks, is represented by the “light of light” of the Nicene Creed) seems to have been universally the sense among the ancients: no trace whatever being found of the meaning <i>‘reflexion.’</i> Nor would the idea he apposite here: the Son of God is, in this his essential majesty, the expression, and the sole expression, of the divine Light, —not, as in his Incarnation, its reflexion) <b>of His glory</b> (not simply <i>His light</i> ; nor need the expression be confined to such literal sense.

And this last seems to be the best meaning: in our place: His <i>essential being</i>, His <i>substance</i>. For in regarding the history of the word, we find that the well-known theological meaning <i>‘person,’</i> was not by any means generally received during the first four centuries. The Nicene Council itself uses <i>“hypostasis”</i> and <i>“essence”</i> in the same sense, and condemns the deriving the Son from another hypostasis or essence from the Father: and so usually Athanasius. The fact was, that the Easterns most commonly used the term to designate the three separate Persons: whereas the Westerns continued to regard it as equivalent to <i>essence</i>, and assumed but one <i>hypostasis:</i> and the Western bishops, assembled with Athanasius at the council of Sardica in 347, distinctly pronounced the assumption of three <i>hypostases</i> heretical, i.e. Arian. Subsequently, however, to this, in the Synod assembled at Alexandria in 362, at which Athanasius, and bishops of Italy, Arabia, Egypt, and Libya were present, the Easterns and Westerns agreed, on examination of one another's meaning, to acknowledge one another as orthodox, and to allow indifferently of the use of <i>three hypostases,</i> signifying ‘Persons,’ and <i>one hypostasis,</i> signifying substance, essence. On all grounds it will be safer here to hold to the primitive meaning of the word, and not to introduce into the language of the apostolic age a terminology which was long subsequent to it), <b>and upholding</b> (bearing up. The Rabbinical writings speak of God as <i>carrying all the worlds by His strength</i>) <b>the universe</b> (the meaning attempted to be given by some Socinian expositors, “the whole kingdom of grace,” is wholly beside the purpose : see Col. i. 17; Job. viii. 3; Rev. iv. 11) <b>by the word</b> (<i>expressed command:</i> compare ch. xi. 3) <b>of his</b> (Whose? His own, or the Fathers? ‘The latter is held by Cyril of Alexandria. And so Grotius and others. But Chrysostom and the great body of Commentators understand <b>his</b> to refer to the Son. The strict parallelism of the clauses would seem to require, that <i>his</i> here should designate the same person, as it does before in this same verse. But such parallelism aud consistency of reference of demonstrative pronouns is by no means observed in the New Test., e.g. Eph. i 20, 22, “And placed Him at His right hand (of the Father), .... and put all things under His feet” (of the Son). In every such ease the reference must be determined by the circumstances, and the things spoken of. And applying that test here, we find that in our former clause it is quite out of the question that <b>his</b> should be reflective, referring, as it clearly does, to another than the subject of the sentence. But when we proceed to our second clause, we find no such bar to the ordinary reflective sense of <b>his</b>, but every reason to adopt it as the most obvious. For we have here an action performed by the Son, who <i>upholds the universe.</i> Whereby ? <b>By the word of His power:</b> where we may certainly say 1) that had another than the subject of the sentence been intended, such intention would have been expressed: and 2) that the assertion would be after all a strange and unexampled one, that the Son. upholds all things by the word of the Father's power, So that, on all accounts, this second <b>his</b> seems better to be referred to the Son) <b>power</b> (not to be weakened into the comparatively unmeaning “his powerful word.” His Power is an inherent attribute, whether uttered or not: the <b>word</b> is that utterance, which He has been pleased to give of it. It is a “powerful word,” but much more is here stated—that it is the word of, proceeding from, giving utterance to, His power), <b>having</b> (or, <b>when He had</b>) <b>made</b> (the vulgate, <i>“making,”</i> is an unfortunate mistranslation, tending to obscure the truth of the completion of the one Sacrifice of the Lord. The words <i>“by Himself”</i> can hardly be retained in the text, in the face of their omission in the most ancient MSS., joined to their internal character as an explanatory gloss. Meanwhile, the gloss is a good and true one. It was by <i>Himself,</i> in the fullest sense) <b>purification of sins</b> (as Bleck observes, there is no occasion to suppose the genitive here equivalent to <i>“from sins,”</i> seeing that we may say, <i>“the sins of a man are purified,”</i> as we read, Matt. viii. 3, <i>“his leprosy was cleansed.”</i> Sin was the great uncleanness, of which He has effected the purga-<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_xU1bftnp6qKtayzihBpPP3NW8XzfOj/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This <i>purification</i> must be understood by the subsequent argument in the Epistle: for that which the Writer had it in his mind to expand in the course of his treatise, he must be supposed to have meant when he used without explanation a concise term, like this. And that we know to have been, the purifications and sacrifices of the Levitical law, by which man’s natural uncleanness in God’s sight was typically removed, and access to God laid open to him. Ebrard’s note here is so important that, though long, I cannot forbear inserting it. “The term <b>purification</b> answers to the Hebrew, and its ideal explanation must be sought in the meaning which suits the Levitical cleansing in the Old Test. worship. Consequently, they are entirely wrong, who understand this <i>purification</i> of moral amelioration, and would so take the <i>‘making purification’</i> in this place, as if the author wished to set forth Christ here as a moral teacher, who by precept and example incited men to amendment, And we pronounce those in error, who go so far indeed as to explain the <i>purification</i> of the propitiatory removal of the guilt of sin, but only on account of later passages in our Epistle, as if the idea of scriptural <i>purification</i> were not already sufficiently clear to establish this, the only true meaning. The whole law of purification, as given by God to Moses, rested on the assumption that our nature, as sinful and guilt-laden, is not capable of coming into immediate contact with our holy God and Judge. The mediation between man and God present in the most holy place, and in that most holy place separated from the people, was revealed in three forms; (<i>a</i>) in sacrifices, (<i>b</i>) in the Priesthood ; and (<i>c</i>) in the Levitical laws of purity. Sacrifices were [typical] acts or means of propitiation for guilt; Priests were the agents for accomplishing these acts, but were not themselves accounted purer than the rest of the people, having consequently to bring offerings for their own sins before they offered for those of the people. Lastly, Levitical purity was the condition which was attained, positively by sacrifice and worship, negatively by avoidance of Levitical pollution,—the condition in which the people was enabled, by means of the priests, to come into relation with God ‘without dying’ [Deut. v. 26]; the result of the cultus which was past, and the postulate for that which was to come. So that that which purified, was sacrifice : and the purification was, the removal of guilt. This is most clearly seen in the ordinance concerning the great day of atonement, Lev. xvi. There we find those three leading features in the closest distinctive relation. First, the sacrifice must be prepared [vv. 1–10]: then, the High Priest is to offer for his own sins [vv. 11—14]: lastly, he is to kill the sin-offering for the people [ver. 15], and with its blood to sprinkle the mercy-seat and all the holy place, and cleanse it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel [ver. 19]; and then he is symbolically to lay the sins of the people on the head of a second victim, and send forth this animal, laden with the curse, into the wilderness. For [ver. 30] ‘on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.’ In the atonement, in the gracious <i>covering</i> of the guilt of sin, consists <i>purification</i> in the scriptural sense. [And so also were those who had become levitically unclean, e.g., lepers, Levit. xiv., cleansed by atoning sacrifices.] So that an Israelitish reader, a Christian Jew, would never, on reading the words <b>made purification</b>, think on what we commonly call ‘moral amelioration,’ which, if not springing out of the living ground of a heart reconciled to God, is mere self deceit, and only external avoidance of evident transgression: but the <b>purification</b> which Christ brought in would, in the sense of our author and his readers, only be understood of that gracious atonement for all guilt of sin of all mankind, which Christ our Lord and Saviour has completed for us by His sinless sufferings and death : and out of which flows forth to us, as from a fountain, all power to love in return, all love to Him, our heavenly Pattern, and all hatred of sin, which caused His death. To speak these words of Scripture with the mouth is easy: but he only can say Yea and Amen to them with the heart who, in simple truthfulness of the knowledge of himself, has looked down even to the darkest depths of his ruined state, natural to him, and intensified by innumerable sins of act,—and, despairing of all help in himself,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8RQ3dpBgC09dtX9JTsu_7PsBEF0QOjh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The expression comes doubtless originally from Ps. cx. 1, cited below. Bleek, in the course of a long and thorough discussion of its meaning as applied to our Lord, shews that it is never used of his priæ-existent coequality with the Father, but always with reference to His exaltation in his humanity after his course of suffering and triumph. It is ever connected, not with the idea of His equality with the Father and share in the majesty of the Godhead, but with His state of waiting, in the immediate presence of the Father, and thus highly exalted by Him, till the purposes of his mediatorial office are accomplished. This his lofty state is, however, not one of quiescence; for (Acts ii. 33) He shed down the gift of the Spirit, —and (Rom. viii. 34) He maketh intercession for us: and below (ch. viii. 1 ff.) He is, for all purposes belonging to that office, our High Priest in Heaven. This <i>“sitting at the right hand of God”</i> is described as lasting until all enemies shall have been subdued unto Him, i.e. until the end of this state of time, and his own second coming: after which, properly and strictly speaking, the state of exaltation described by these words shall come to an end, and that mysterious completion of the supreme glory of the Son of God shall take place, which St. Paul describes, 1 Cor. xv. 28) <b>of Majesty</b> (this word <b>majesty</b> is often found in the Septuagint, and principally as referring to the divine greatness) <b>on high</b> (<i>in high places,</i> i.e. <i>in heaven</i>.

In the same sense we have <i>“in the highest,”</i> Luke ii. 14; xix. 38; Job xvi. 20; Ecclus. xxvi. 16; Matt. xxi. 9; Mark xi. 10, Ebrard says: “HEAVEN, in Holy Scripture, signifies never unbounded space, nor omnipresence, but always either the starry firmament, or, more usually, that sphere of the created world of space and time, where the union of God with the personal creature is not severed by sin,—where no Death reigns, where the glorification of the body is not a mere hope of the future. Into that sphere has the Firstling of risen and glorified manhood entered, as into a place, with visible glorified Body, visibly to return again from thence.” The omission of the article <i>“the”</i> here gives majesty and solemnity —its insertion would seem to hint at other <i>majesties</i> in the background), <b>having become</b> (distinct from <i>“being,”</i> ver. 3: that, importing His essential, this, His superinduced state. For we are are now, in the course of the enunciation,—which has advanced to the main subject of the argument, the proving of the superiority of the New Covenant,—treating of the post-incarnate majesty of the Son of God. HE WAS all that has been detailed in ver. 3: He made purification of sins, and sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high, and thus BECAME this which is now spoken of. This is denied by Chrysostom, but recognized by ‘Theodoret, in a form however not strictly exact: for he applied it <i>only to the Humanity</i> of our Lord. To this Bleck very properly objects, that the making this exaltation belong only to Christ’s human nature, and supposing Him to have while on earth possessed still the fulness of the majesty of his Godhead, is not according to the usage of our Writer, nor of the New Test. generally, and in fact induces something like a double personality in the Son of God. The Scriptures teach us that He who was with God before the creation, from love to men put on flesh, and took the form of a servant, not all the while having on Him the whole fulness of his divine nature and divine glory, but having really and actually emptied himself of this fulness and glory, so that there was not only a hiding, but an absolute <i>inanition,</i> a putting off, of it. Therefore His subsequent exaltation must be conceived of as belonging, not to his Humanity only, but to the entire undivided Person of Christ, now resuming the fulness and glory of the Godhead (John xvii. 5), and in addition to this having taken into the Godhead the Manhood, now glorified by his obedience, atonement, and victory. See Eph.i. 20–22; Phil. ii.6–9; Acts ii. 36; 1 Pet. iii. 21,22.

It is used only three times by St. Paul, and never [unless 1 Cor. xii. 31, in the received text, be counted] in this sense: but thirteen times in this Epistle) <b>the angels</b> (of God; the heavenly created beings; afterwards, ver. 14, called <i>“ministering spirits.”</i> All attempts to evade this plain meaning are futile; and proceed on ignorance of the argument of our Epistle, and of the Jewish theology. But <i>why</i> should the angels be here brought in? and why should the superiority of the Incarnate Son of God to them be so insisted on and elaborated? Bleek gives a very insufficient reason, when he says that the mention of God’s throne brought to the Writer’s mind the angels who are the attendants there. The reason, as Ebrard remarks, lies far deeper. The whole Old Test. dispensation is related to the New Test. dispensation, as the angels to the Son. In the former, mankind, and Israel also, stands separated from God by sin: and angels, divine messengers [as in the expression “the angel of the covenant”), stand as mediators between man and God. And of these there is, so to speak, a chain of two links: viz., Moses, and the angel of the Lord. The first link is a mere man, who is raised above his fellow-men by his calling, by his office, the commission given to him,—and brought nearer to God; but he is a sinner as they are, and is in reality no more a partaker of the divine nature than they are. The second link is the angelic form in which God revealed Himself to his people, coming down to their capacity, like to man, without being man. So that Godhead and Manhood approximated to one another: a man was com- missioned and enabled to hear God’s word: God appeared in a form in which men might see Him: but the two found no point of contact; no real union of the Godhead and the Manhood took place. Whereas in the Son, God and the Manhood not only approximated, but became personally one. God no longer accommodates Himself to the capacities of men in an angelophany or theophany, but has revealed the fulness of his divine nature in the man Jesus,—in that He, who was the <i>brightness</i> of his glory, became man. The argument of the Writer necessarily then leads him to shew how both Mediators, the angel of the Old Test. covenant, and Moses, found their higher unity in Christ. First, he shews this of the angel or angels [for it was not always one individual angelic being, but various] by whom the first covenant was given: then of Moses, ch. iii. iv. This first portion is divided into two: vv. 4—14, in which he shews that the Son, as the eternal Son of God, is higher than the angels [see the connexion of this with the main argument below]: then, after an exhortation [ii. 1–4] founded on this, tending also to impress on us the superior holiness of the New Test. revelation, the second part [ii. 5–18] in which he shews that in the Son, the manhood also is exalted above the angels), <b>in proportion as he hath inherited</b> (as his own: the word being perhaps chosen in reference to the Old Test. prophecies, which promised it to Him : see below. The <i>perfect</i> is important, as denoting something belonging to His present and abiding state, not an event wholly past, as <i>“sat down”</i> above, indicating the first “setting himself down,” though that word might also be used of a permanent state of session) <b>a more distinguished</b> (or, <b>more excellent</b>) <b>name</b> (to be taken in its proper sense, not understood to mean precedence or dignity as ver. 5 shews: whence also we get an easy answer to the enquiry, <i>what name</i> is intended : viz. that of <b>Son</b>, in the peculiar and individual sense of the citation there. ‘The angels themselves are called <i>“sons of God,”</i> Job i. 6; ii. 1; xxxviii. 7: Dan. iii. 25, and Gen. vi. 2 [see Jude 6 note, and Introd. to Jude, § v. 11]: but the argument here is that the title “SON OF GOD” is bestowed on him individually, in a sense in which it never was conferred upon an angel. See as a parallel, Phil. ii. 9 ff. It must be remembered, as Delitzsch beautifully remarks, that the fulness of glory of the peculiar name of the Son of God is unattainable by human speech or thought: it is, Rev. xix. 12, <i>“a name which none knoweth but Himself.”</i> And all the citations aud appellations here are but<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d_NjVgoiyA7XHY6fHP2OlE6Ck-xlXCX9/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The answer must not be hastily made, as by some Commentators, that the term <b>inherited</b> implies the glorification of the humanity of Christ to that Sonship which He before had in virtue of his Deity. Evidently so partial a reference cannot be considered as exhausting the sense of the Writer. Nor again can we say that it was at the time of His incarnation, though the words of the angel in Luke i. 35, <i>“That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God,”</i> seem to favour such a reference : for it was especially at His incarnation, that He was made <i>a little lower than the angels</i>, ch. ii. 9. Rather would the sense seem to be, that the especial name of SON, belonging to Him not by ascription nor adoption, but by His very Being itself, has been ever, and is now, His: <i>inherited</i> by Him, “in that He is the very Son of God,” as Chrysostom says: the Old Test. declarations being as it were portions of the instrument by which this inheritance is assured to Him, and by the citation of which it is proved. Observe that the <i>having become better than the angels</i> is not <i>identical with</i> the <i>inheriting,</i> but <i>in proportion to</i> it: the triumphant issue of his Mediation is consonant to the glorious Name, which is His by inheritance: but which, in the fulness of its present inconceivable glory [see above], has been put on and taken up by Him in the historical process of his mediatorial humiliation and triumph) than they. <h2><u><b>5—18.</u></h2></b> <i>Proof from Scripture of this last declaration.</i><h2><u><b>5.</u></h2></b> <b>For</b> (substantiation of His having inherited a more exalted name than the angels) <b>to whom of</b> (among) <b>the angels did He</b> (God, the subject of vv. 1,2; as the subsequent citation shews) <b>ever say</b> (this citation from Ps. ii. has brought up in recent German Commentators the whole question of the original reference of that Psalm, and of Old Test. citations in the New Test. altogether. These discussions will be found in Bleek, De Wette, and Ebrard. The latter is by far the deepest and most satisfactory: seeing, as he does, the furthest into the truth of the peculiar standing of the Hebrew people, and the Messianic import of the theocracy. Those who entirely or partially deny this latter, seem to me to be without adequate means of discussing the question. Ebrard’s view is, that the Psalm belongs to the reign of David. The objection that ver. 6 will not apply to David’s anointing, inasmuch as that took place at Bethlehem in his boyhood, he answers, by regarding that anointing as connected with his establishment on Mount Zion, not as having locally taken place there, but as the first of that series of divine mercies of which that other was the completion. He further ascribes the Psalm to that portion of David’s reign when (2 Sam. viii.) Hadadezer, and many neighbouring nations, were smitten by him: which victories he looked on as the fulfilment to him of Nathan’s prophecy, 2 Sam. vii, 8–17. In that prophecy the offspring of David is mentioned in the very words quoted below in this verse, and in terms which, he contends, will not apply to Solomon, but must be referred to the great promised Seed of David. He regards this triumphant. occasion as having been trented by the royal Psalmist as a type and foretaste of the ultimate ideal dominion of the “Son of David” over the kings of the earth), <b>Thou</b> (the seed of David, anointed in God’s counsels as king on his holy hill of Sion : see above) <b>art my Son</b> (according; to the promise presently to be quoted, finding its partial fulfilment in Solomon, but its only entire one in the Son of David who is also the Son of God), <b>I</b> (emphatic : “I and no other:” expressed also in the Hebrew) <b>this day have begotten thee</b> (first, what are we to understand by this term, <b>have begotten</b>? Bleck says, “As Sonship, in the proper sense, is dependent on the act of begetting, so may, especially by the Hebrews, ‘to beget’ be figuratively used to express the idea of ‘making any one a son,’ in which derived and figurative reference this also may be meant. And we get an additional confirmation of this meaning from Jer ii. 27, where it is said of the foolish idolatrous Israelites, ‘They say to a stock, Thou art my father, and to a ‘stone, Thou hast begotten me’ (so the Septuagint). Accordingly, the meaning here is,—’I have made Thee my Son’ [so Ps. lxxxix. 20, 26, 27: ‘I have found David my servants with my holy oil have I anointed him: ....

Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth’]:—namely, by setting Thee on the throne of my people: and the term <b>this day</b> will most naturally be referred to the time of the anointing of the King on Zion, as the act whereby he was manifested as Son of God in this sense.” And so Calvin. The above remarks seem pertinent and unobjectionable, as long as we regard them as explaining the supposed immediate reference to David and present circumstances: but it is plain that, according to the above view of Ps. ii., and indeed to the usage of the New Test., in applying this passage to our Lord, we want another and a higher sense in which both the words, <b>I have begotten,</b> and <b>this day,</b> may be applicable to Him : a sense in which I should be disposed to say that the words must in their fulness of meaning be taken, to the neglect and almost the obliteration of that their supposed lower reference. For, granting the application of such sayings to our Lord, then must the terms of them, suggested by the Holy Spirit of prophecy, which is His testimony, bear adequate interpretations as regards His person and office. It has not therefore been without reason that the Fathers, and so many modern divines, have found in this term <b>I have begotten</b> the doctrine of the generation of the Son of God, and have endeavoured, in accordance with such reference, to assign a fitting sense to <b>this day</b>. As the subject is exceedingly important, and has been generally passed over slightly by our English expositors, I shall need no apology for gathering from Bleck and Snuicer the opinions and testimonies concerning it. 1) One view refers <b>this day</b> to the eternal generation of the Son, and regards it as an expression of the everlasting <i>present</i> of eternity. Thus Origen very grandly says, “This is said to Him by God, with whom ‘to-day’ ever is present: for with God, as I think, is no evening, because neither is there morning, but the time which reaches, so to speak, over His unbegotten and eternal life, is an everlasting ‘to-day,’ in which the Son is begotten: no beginning of His being begotten being found, as neither of this ‘to-day.’” And so Athanasius, Augustine, and other Fathers and moderns. 2) A second, to the generation, <i>in time,</i> of the Incarnate Son of Man, when Jesus assumed the divine nature on the side of his <i>Manhood also:</i> so Chrysostom, Theodoret, Eusebius, Cyril Alex., and others. 3) A third, to the period when Jesus was manifested to men as the Son of God, i.e. by most, to the time of the Resurrection, with reference to Acts xiii. 33, where St. Paul alleges this citation as thus applying [so, recently, Delitzsch]: by some, to that of the Ascension, when He was set at the right hand of God and entered on His heavenly High Priesthood [ch. v. 5]: so Hilary, Ambrose, Calvin, Grotius, and the Socinians. Owen also takes the same view [“the eternal generation of Christ, on which His filiation or sonship, both name and thing, doth depend, is to be taken only declaratively, and that declaration to be made in His resurrection, and exaltation over all, that ensued thereon”]. Of these interpretations, I agree with Bleck that the <i>first</i> is that which best agrees with the context. The former verses represent to us the Son of God as standing in this relation to the Father before the worlds: and ver. 6, which plainly forms a contrast to this ver. 5 as to time, treats distinctly of the period of the Incarnation. It is natural then to suppose that this verse is to be referred to a time prior to that event) ? <b>And again</b> (how is the ellipsis here to be supplied? Probably, <b>and</b> [<i>to whom of the angels ever said He</i>] <b>again</b>: or perhaps, <b>again</b> [see below on ver. 6] merely serves to introduce a fresh citation), <b>I will be to Him as</b> (for) <b>a father, and he shall be to me as</b> (for) <b>a son</b> (the citation is from the Septuagint, as usual. It occurs in the prophecy of Nathan to David respecting David's offspring who should come after him. The import of it has been above considered, and its connexion with Ps. ii. shown to be probable. The direct primary reference of the words to Solomon, 1 Chron. xxii. 7–10, does not in any way preclude the view which I have there taken of their finding their higher and only worthy fulfilment in the greater Son of David, who should build the only Temple in which God would really dwell)?<h2><u><b>6.</u></h2> But</b> (because a further proof, and a more decisive one as regards the angels, is about to be adduced) <b>when He again</b> (or, <i>“when again He?”</i> Does <b>again</b> introduce a new citation, or does it belong to the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-YGRFq-3a0KbK46Oxfqb80lTHfnWzDSM/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This latter view is taken by many, principally the ancient expositors, and lately by Tholuck, De Wette, Lünemann, and Delitzsch,—interpreting the ‘second introduction’ diversely: some, as His incarnation, contrasted with His everlasting generation, or His creating of the world, which they treat as His first introduction: others, as His resurrection, contrasted with His incarnation: others, to His second coming, as contrasted with His first. The other view supposes a transposition of the adverb <i>again,</i> which in the original stands between <i>when</i> and the verb. I have shewn in my Gr. Test. that such a transposition is without examples. In this Epistle, when <i>“again”</i> is joined to a verb, it always has the sense of <i>‘a second time:’</i> e.g. ch. iv. 7; v. 12; vi. 1, 6. This being the ease, I must agree with those who join <b>again</b> with <b>hath introduced</b>. And of the meanings which they assign to the phrase <i>“bringing in again,”</i> I conceive the only allowable one to be, the second coming of our Lord to judgment. See more below) hath (‘shall have’ It appears from all usage that the <i>present</i> rendering, <i>“bringeth in,”</i> is quite inadmissible) <b>hath introduced</b> (in what sense? See some of the interpretations above. But even those who hold the transposition of the word <b>again</b> are not, agreed as to the <i>introduction</i> here referred to. Some hold one of the above-mentioned meanings, some another. I have discussed the meaning fully below, and gathered that the word can only refer to the great entering of the Messiah on His kingdom. At present, the usage of the verb here used must be considered. It is the accustomed word in the Pentateuch for the ‘introducing’ the children of Israel into the lund of promise, the putting them into possession of their promised inheritance : see also Ps. lxxviii. 54. We have it again in Neh. i. 9, of the second introduction, or restoration of Israel to the promised land. The prophets again use it of the ultimate restoration of Israel : compare Isa. xiv. 2; lvi. 7; Jer. iii.14; Ezek. xxxiv. 13; xxxvi. 24; xxxvii. 21; Zech. viii. 8. This fact, connected with the circumstances to be noted below, makes it probable that the word here also has this solemn sense of ‘putting in possession of,’ as of an inheritance. The sense ordinarily given, of ‘bringing into the world,’ the act of the Father corresponding to the <i>“coming into the world”</i> [ch. x. 5] of the Son appears to be unexampled) <b>the firstborn</b> (only here is the Son of God so called absolutely. It is His title by præ-existence, <i>“the </i><b>firstborn</b><i> of all creation,”</i> Col. i. 15 [where see the word itself discussed]:—by prophecy, Ps, lxxxix. 27, <i>“I will make Him my </i><b>firstborn,</b><i> higher than the kings of the earth:”</i> —by birth, Luke ii. 7, see also Matt. i, 18–25:—by victory over death, Col. i. 18; Rev. i. 5:—and here, where He is absolutely <b>the Firstborn,</b> it will he reasonable to regard all these references as being accumulated — Him, who is <i>the Firstborn,</i>—of the universe, of the new manhood, of the risen dead. And thus the inducting Him in glory into His inheritance is clothed with even more solemnity. All angels, all men, are but the younger sons of God, compared to HIM, THE FIRSTBORN) <b>into the world</b> (not the same word as that so rendered, ch. x. 5: but signifying the ‘inhabited earth:’ and very frequently used by the Septuagint in prophetic passages, where the future judgments of God on mankind are spoken of. The usage would not indeed be decisive against referring the words to Christ’s entrance into the human nature, but is much more naturally satisfied by the other interpretation), <b>He</b> (i.e. God, the subject of ver. 5) <b>saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him</b> (there are two places from which these words might come; and the comparison of the two will be very instructive as to the connexion and citation of prophecy. 1) The words themselves, including the <b>and</b>, which has no independent meaning here, come from Deut. xxxii. 43, where they conclude the dying song of Moses with a triumphant description of the victory of God over His enemies, and the avenging of His people. It will cause the intelligent student of Scripture no surprise to find such words cited directly of Christ, into whose hand all judgment is committed: however such Commentators as Stuart and De Wette may reject the idea of the citation being from thence, because no trace of a Messianic reference is there found.

But those who see not Christ every where in the Old Testament, see Him nowhere. The fact of the usual literal citation of the Septuagint by our Writer, decides the point as far as the place is concerned from which the words are immediately taken. But here a difficulty arises. The words in the Septuagint, Deut. xxxii. 43, <i>“Rejoice ye heavens, with Him, and let all the angels of God worship Him,”</i> do not exist in our present Hebrew text. It is hardly however probable, that they are an insertion of the Septuagint, found as they are [with one variation presently to be noticed] in nearly all the MSS. The translators probably found them in their Hebrew text, which, especially in the Pentateuch, appears to have been an older and purer recension than that which we now possess. 2) The other passage from which they might come is Ps. xcvi. 7, where however they do not occur verbatim, but we read, “worship Him, all ye angels of God.” This, especially the omission of the and, which clearly belongs to the citation, is against the supposition of their being taken from thence: but it does not therefore follow that the Psalm was not in the Sacred Writer’s mind, or does not apply to the same glorious period of Messiah's triumph in its ultimate reference. Indeed the similarity of the two expressions of triumph is remarkable). <h2><u><b>7.</u></h2> And</b> (with reference) <b>indeed to the angels He</b> (God) <b>saith, Who maketh his angels winds</b> (see below), <b>and his ministers a flame of fire</b> (the citation is after the Septuagint according to the Alexandrine MS., which indeed commonly agrees with the citations in this Epistle. And as the words stand in the Greek, the arrangement and rendering of them is unquestionably as above. But here comes in no small difficulty as to the sense of the original Hebrew. It is usually contended that its words can only mean, from the context, “who maketh the winds his messengers, and flames of fire his servants.” But I have maintained in my Greek Test. that the sense is, “who maketh his messengers winds, his servants flames of fire,” whatever these words may be intended to import. And this latter enquiry will I imagine be not very difficult to answer. He makes his messengers winds, i.e. He causes his messengers to act in or by means of the winds; his servants flames of fire, i.e. commissions them to assume the agency or form of flames for His purposes. Tt seems to me that this, the plain sense of the Hebrew as it stands, is quite as agreeable to the context as the other. And thus the Rabbis took it. The only accommodation of the original passage made by the Writer, is the very slight one of applying the general terms “His messengers” and “His servants” to the angels, which indeed can be their only meaning. The sense of the words I have endeavoured to give in some measure above. It is evident that the word represented in the A. V. by <i>spirits,</i> must be rendered <b>winds,</b> not <i>‘spirits:’</i> from both the context in the Psalm and the correspondence of the two clauses, and also from the nature of the subject. “They all <i>are</i> spirits,” as asserted below, ver. 14: therefore it could not with any meaning be said, that He <i>maketh them</i> spirits). <b>But unto the Son,— Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: and the rod</b> (i.e. sceptre: see especially Esth. iv. 11; Amos i. 5, where the same Hebrew word occurs) <b>of thy kingdom is the rod of straightness</b> (i.e. righteousness, justice). <b>Thou lovedst</b> (the Writer refers the words to the whole life of our Lord on earth, as a past period) <b>righteousness, and hatedst iniquity; for this cause</b> (because of His love of righteousness and hatred of iniquity, shewn by his blameless life and perfect obedience on earth)<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H7ebfc1NwjWl1xFF72TDIqBveTzcjSXh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For it is a consequent upon the righteous course of the Son of God in his Humanity, and therefore belongs to his triumph, in which He is exalted above his fellows [see below]. Again, the <i>“oil of gladness”</i> below seems rather to point to a festive and triumphant, than to an inaugurative unction. We should therefore rather take the allusion to be, as in Ps. xxiii. 5; xcii. 10, to the custom of anointing guests at feasts: so that, as the King in the Psalm is anointed with the oil of rejoicing above his fellows, because of his having loved righteousness and hated iniquity, so Christ, in the jubilant celebration of His finished course at his exaltation in heaven, is anointed with the festive oil <i>above His fellows</i> [see below]. There is of course an allusion also in the word <b>anointed</b> (echrīsen) to the honoured and triumphant. Name <i>Christ</i>) <b>with oil of rejoicing</b> (see above: oil indicative of joy, as it is of superabundance: compare Isa. lxi. 3) <b>beyond thy fellows</b> (i.e. in the Psalm, ‘other kings:’ hardly ‘brothers by kin’ [other sons of David], as Grotius and others. But to whom does the Writer apply the words? Chrysostom says, “Who are the <i>fellows,</i> except <i>men?</i> And the meaning is, Christ received not the Holy Spirit by measure.” Theodoret on the Psalm, Calvin, Beza, and others, think of believers, the adopted into God’s family : others, of the High Priests, prophets, and kings, in the Old Test., anointed as types of Christ: others, of <i>all creatures:</i> others, as in the Psalm, of <i>other kings.</i> Camero says, “Christ had in His office no fellows ; in His human nature, all men ; in grace, all the faithful.” Still we may answer to all these, that they do not in any way satisfy the requirements of the context. Were it the intent of the Writer to shew Christ’s superiority over his human brethren of <i>every kind,</i> we might accept one or other of these meanings: but as this is not his design, but to shew His superiority to the angels, we must I think take the word <b>fellows</b> as representing other heavenly beings, partakers in the same glorious and sinless state with Himself, though not in the strict sense, His “fellows.” De Wette objects to this sense, that the Writer places the angels far beneath Christ: Delitzsch, that the angels are not <i>anointed,</i> whereas there is no necessity in the text for understanding that these <i>fellows</i> are also anointed: the comparison may consist in the very fact of the anointing itself:— and Ebrard, speaking as usual strongly, says that “neither the Psalmist, nor our author if in his senses, could have applied the word to the angels.” But this need not frighten us: and we may well answer with Lünemann, 1) “that the general comparison here being that of Christ with the angels, the fresh introduction of this point of comparison in ver. 9 cannot of itself appear inappropriate. 2) Granted, that just before, in ver. 7, the angels are placed far beneath Christ,—we have this very inferiority here marked distinctly by the terms of this comparison. 3) The angels are <i>next</i> to Christ in rank, by the whole course of this argument: to whom then would the Writer more naturally apply the term <i>fellows,</i> than to them?” I may add, 4) that the comparison here is but analogous to that in ver. 4, of which indeed it is an expansion: and 5) that thus only can the figure of anointing at a triumphant festival be carried out consistently: that triumph having taken place on the exaltation of the Redeemer to the Father’s right hand and throne [ver. 8], when, the whole of the heavenly company, His <i>fellows</i> in glory and joy, being anointed with the oil of gladness, His share and dignity was so much greater than theirs. It remains that we should consider the general import, and application here, of Ps. xlv. From what is elsewhere found in this commentary, it will not be for a moment supposed that I can give in to the view of such writers as De Wette and Hupfeld, who maintain that it was simply an ode to some king, uncertain whom, and has no further reference whatever.

Thus considered, such applications as this lose all their difficulty; and we cease to feel ourselves obliged in every case to enquire to whom and on what occasion the Psalm was probably first addressed. And even descending to the low and mere rationalistic ground taken by De Wette and Hupfeld, we are at least safer than they are, holding as we do a meaning in which both Jews and Christians have so long concurred, as against the infinite diversity of occasion and reference which divides their opinions of the Psalm).<h2><u><b>10.</u></h2> And</b> (<i>He saith to the Son: </i>see a similar <i>And</i> introducing a new citation in Acts i. 20. The comma and capital letter, as in text, should be retained after this <b>And), Thou, in the beginning, Lord</b> (this has no word to represent it in the Hebrew. But it is taken up from <i>“O my God”</i> in ver. 24; and indeed from the whole strain of address, in which <i>Jehovah</i> has been thrice expressed; in vv.1,12,15. On the bearing and interpretation of the Psalm, see below), <b>foundedst the earth; and the heavens are works of thine hands</b> (see Ps. viii. 3): <h2><u><b>11.</u></h2> they</b> (seems most naturally to refer to <i>the heavens</i> immediately preceding. There is no reason in the Psalm why the pronoun should not represent both antecedents, the heavens and the earth. Here, however, the subsequent context seems to determine the application to be only to the heavens: for to them only can be referred the following image, <i>“as a vesture shalt thou fold thein up”</i>) <b>shall perish</b> (as far as concerns their present state. Compare the parallel expression, <i>“shall be changed,”</i> below); <b>but thou remainest</b> (Bleck prefers the future, on the ground of the verbs being all future in the Hebrew text. But perhaps the consideration alleged by Lümemann, that the Writer, using only the Septuagint, seems to place <i>“but thou remainest”</i> and <i>“but thou art the same,”</i> as parallel clauses, is of more weight than the other. De Wette, on the Psalm, renders the Hebrew verbs <i>present.</i> The verb in the original is a compound one, giving the sense of endurance through all changes); <b>and they all shall wax old as a garment </b>(see Isa. li. 6, <i>“The earth shall wax old like a garment:”</i> also Isa. l. 9; and Ecclus. xiv. 17); <b>and as a mantle</b> (the word signifies any enveloping, enwrapping garment) <b>shalt thou fold them up</b> (the Hebrew here, and apparently some copies of the Septuagint, have the same verb as below: <i>“thou shalt change them,”</i>— “thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed.” But the Alexandrine MS. reads as our text: and there can be little doubt that the Writer of this Epistle followed that text as usual), <b>and they shall be changed</b> (viz. as a mantle is folded up to be put away when a fresh one is about to be put on): <b>but thou art the same</b> (Hebrew, “and Thou art He:” viz., He, which thou hast ever been: compare Isa. xlvi. 4), <b>and thy years shall not fail</b> (Hebrew, “Thy years end not,” are never completed.

And the trust of Israel in this her Deliverer was ever directed to the comfort of her sons under the immediate trouble of the time, be that what it might. As generations went on, more and more was revealed of the Messiah’s office and work, and the hearts of God’s people entered deeper and deeper into the consolation to be derived from the hope of His coming. Here then we have this sorrowing one casting himself on the mercy of the great Deliverer, and extolling his faithfulness and firmness over, and as distinguished from, all the works of His hands. To apply then these words to the Redeemer, is to use them in their sense of strictest propriety).<h2><u><b>13.</u></h2> But</b> (the contrast is again taken up from ver, 8) <b>to whom of the angels hath He </b>(God, as before) <b>ever said, Sit thou on my right hand until I place thine enemies </b>(as)<b> a footstool</b> (the allusion is to the custom of putting the feet on the necks of conquered enemies, see Josh. x. 24f.) <b>of thy feet?</b> Hardly any Psalm is so often quoted in the New Test. with reference to Christ, as Ps. cx. And no Psalm more clearly finds its ultimate reference and completion only in Christ, as even those confess, who question its being immediately addressed to Him at first: and regard the argument of our Lord to the Pharisees founded on this place, as merely one grounded on concession on both sides. On the theocratic principle of interpretation, there is not the slightest difficulty in the application of the words directly to Him who is (and was ever regarded, even in David’s time) Israel’s King, the Head and Chief of the theocracy. <br><br>And see this further carried out in the note on ch. v. 6.<h2><u><b>14.</u></h2> Are they not all</b> (all the angels) <b>ministering </b>(in reference probably to the word <i>“ministers”</i> in ver. 7. The word, signifying <i>“pertaining to the ministry,”</i> is used in the Septuagint of any thing pertaining to the <i>ministers</i> or their service; the instruments, vessels, garments, or offerings for the ministry: here, of those devoted to or belonging to the ministry of God) <b>spirits</b> (unembodied beings, even as God Himself, but distinguished by the epithet <i>presiding.</i> The idea of “angels of service” or “of the ministry,” is familiar to the rabbis), <b>sent forth</b> (it is the <i>present participle,</i> so also in Rev. v. 6: he does not mean that angels have before now, in insulated cases, been sent forth, but that they are ever thus being sent forth,—it is their normal work and regular duty through all the ages of time) <b>for ministry</b> (in order to the ministration which is their work. The A. V., “sent forth to minister for them,” gives a wrong idea of the meaning. The <i>ministry</i> is not a <i>waiting upon men,</i> but a fulfilment of their office as <i>ministers of God.</i> See Rom. xiii. 4. Compare with this expression Col.i.7, <i>“a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf”</i>) <b>on behalf of those who are about to inherit salvation</b> (in the highest sense—eternal salvation: not, as Kuinoel and others, “deliverance from dangers:” in so solemn a reference, that meaning would be quite beside the purpose. Those spoken of are the elect of God, they who love Him, and for whom all things work together for good, even the principalities and powers in heavenly places. And if it be said, that the ministration of angels has often been used for other immediate purposes than the behoof of the elect, we may answer, that all those things may well come under the <i>ministry,</i> on account of <i>them who shall be heirs of salvation</i>: for all things are theirs; and for them, in and as united to Christ, all events are ordered)? Thus the Son of God is proved superior to the angels—i.e. to the highest. of created beings: who, so far from being equal with Him, worship Him, and serve His purposes.<h1><u><b>CHAP.

Delitzsch has gone into it at length, and Hofmann has treated of it in two places. Both are agreed that <b>the holy place</b> betokens the immediate immaterial presence of God, the veritable Holy of Holies, beyond, and ap- approached through, the heavens, ch. iv. 14. But as regards <b>the tabernacle</b> they differ. Hofmann maintains it to be the glorified body of Christ, and argues that it alone will satisfy such expressions as that in ch. ix. 11, “<i>not of this creation:</i>” in order to satisfying which, this <i>tabernacle</i> must belong to the new creation, the <i>regeneration</i>, which commences with the glorification of Christ. This glorified body of His is the new and abiding temple of God, in which He dwells and meets with us who are united to and have put on that glorified body, our house, eternal in the heavens: for so Hofmann interprets 2 Cor. v. 1 ff. On the other hand, Delitzsch controverts this view, as inconsistent with the symbolism in ch. ix. 11, 12, where Christ, “through the greater and more perfect tabernacle .... entered into the holy place,” taking this connexion of the words: and also with our ver. 5, where the Mosaic tabernacle is set forth as the representation and shadow of the heavenly. Accordingly, he believes the <i>tabernacle</i> here to be the heavenly Jerusalem, the worship-place of blessed spirits [Ps. xxix. 9] and of those men who have been rapt in vision thither [Isa. vi.],–the “<i>temple of the tabernacle Of witness</i>,” of Rev. xv.5,—the place where God's <i>visible</i> presence [in contradistinction to His personal and invisible presence in the <i>holy places</i>] is manifested to his creatures angelic and human. In weighing these two opinions, I own they seem to me to run into one, and of that one by far the larger component is on Hofmann’s side.<br><br>For what is the Heavenly Jerusalem ? What but the aggregate, in their persons and their glorious abiding-place, of the triumphant saints and servants of God? And what is this aggregate, but the mystical body of which Christ is the Head and they are the members, in its fulfilment and perfection? That glorified body of His, in which they are accepted before God, and in which as a heavenly temple they serve God, and God dwells, He has passed through, not by passing out of it, but by finally establishing it as an accomplished thing in God's sight, and in and as proceeding forth from it carrying on his intercession and <i>ministration in the true tabernacle</i>, in the <i>holy place</i> itself, See more on this subject, ch. ix. 11: and the views of Bleek, Tholuck, &c.: also a sermon of Schileiermacher’s on the text, vol. ii, of his Predigten, p. 504).<h2><u><b>3—6.</b></u></h2> This <i>heavenly office and work our High Priest must have, if He le veritably a High Priest.</i> <b>3.</b>] <b>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices</b> (see the very similar passage, ch. v. 1, and note there): <b>whence it is necessary that this (High Priest) also have somewhat which He may offer</b> (there is here considerable difficulty. For the Writer is evidently, from what follows, laying the stress on the <i>heavenly “ministry”</i> of Christ: and this “<i>somewhat to offer</i>” applies therefore to His work, not on earth, but in heaven, If so, how comes it to be said that He has somewhat to offer in heaven, seeing that His offering, of Himself, was made once for all, in contradistinction to those of the Levitical priests which were being constantly offered? See especially ch. x. 11, 12, which, on this view, brings the Writer here into direct contradiction to himself, In order to avoid this, Lũnemann and Hofmann attempt to make the “<i>somewhat to offer</i>” retrospective: “it is necessary for Him to have [there, in heaven] somewhat [viz. His body] which he may have offered.” But surely this is a view which cannot be admitted.

Thus regarded then, what is it which our High Priest in heaven has to offer? In ch. v.7, He is described as <i>having offered</i> prayers and supplications in the days of His flesh: and it might be thought that His <i>interceding for us</i>, ch. vii. 25, might be here meant, the offering being those intercessions. But this would hardly satisfactorily give the force of the word <b>somewhat</b>, which,as Delitzsch remarks, is too concrete for such an interpretation. It must be something with which and by virtue of which, and as offering and applying which, our High Priest enters and ministers in the Holy of Holies above. Now if we look to the analogy of ch. ix. <b>7, 12, </b> we see (1) that the high priest entered the holy place “<i>not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the ignorances of the people,</i>”—(2) that Christ is entered into the <i>holy places of heaven, not with the blood of goats and bulls, but by</i> <b>His own blood</b>: see also ib. ver. 25. This BLOOD of the one offering, Christ is represented as bearing into the Holy Place, and its application is set ever forth to us as a continuing and constantly repeated one. Thus this <i>blood of sprinkling</i> is regarded us being in <i>heaven</i>, ch. xii. 24: as <i>being sprinkled on the believer as the end of his election</i>, 1 Pet. i. 2: as<i> cleansing us from all sin</i>, 1 John i. 7: as <i>that wherein the saints wash their robes and make them white</i>, Rev. vii. 14. Still, as Delitzsch also remarks, this is not the place to enlarge on this matter, seeing that it is merely incidentally introduced here, the present object being to shew that it is in heaven, and not on earth, that our High Priest ministers). <b>4.</u></h2> Yea, if</b> (the connexion is<br><br>obvious: “our High Priest must have somewhat to offer.

If now we ask what this <b>pattern</b> was, we are met with various replies. Faber Stapulensis interprets it, “that what was shewn to Moses in the mount was not the truth itself, but only an adumbration and idea of it.” And so Schlichting, concluding, “so that the ancient tabernacle was only an example of an example, and a shadow of a shadow.” This view is strongly controverted by Delitzsch, who takes the <b>pattern</b> to be the veritable heavenly things themselves, not seen however by Moses directly and naturally, which would be impossible, but made visible to him in a vision. I do not see that there is much to choose between the two views. If the latter be taken, then surely the vision thus vouchsafed to Moses was itself only an intermediate representation, and so this view comes much to the same as the other. <b>6.</u></h2> But now</b> (the logical, not the temporal <i>now</i>, as in ch. ix. 26; xi. 16, and frequently in St. Paul, meaning, “as the fact really is”) H<b>e hath obtained a more excellent ministry</b> (than that of any earthly priests), <b>in proportion as He is also</b> (<b>also</b>, introducing a special reference to an already acknowledged fact, as in ch. vi. 7, where see note) <b>mediator </b>(the meaning of the word is, one who becomes a goer between two persons, assuring to each the consent of the other to some point agreed on in common.

This is the case, however this salvation, in the perception and declaration of the prophet, is bound up with the restoration of the ancient covenant people and their reunion in the land of their home.” Bleek), <b>Behold</b>, the <b>days come, saith the Lord</b> (“the prophecy, taken from this rich cyele of prophecies concerning the last things, whose clear Messianic sense allows of no evasion, begins with Jcremiah’s constant formula. ‘<i>behold the days come</i>.’” Delitzsch), and (so literally, meaning, <b>when) I will ac- complish upon</b> (the Septuagint has, “<i>I will make with.</i>” The difference is beyond doubt intentional, to set forth the completeness of the new covenant) <b>the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah</b> (both these, Israel first and Judah afterwards, were sent into captivity for their sins: and both are specified severally in God’s promise of grace and restoration) <b>a new covenant</b> (see on ch. vii. 22): <b>9.</b></u></h2> (this covenant is first specified negatively: it is <i>not</i> to be like that first one) <b>not according to the covenant</b> (different in quality from, not after the measure of) <b>which I appointed to</b> (not “<i>with:</i>” it is a pure dative, and betokens mere agency on the part of the subject, God: the people of Israel, the objects, being only recipients, not co-agents) <b>their fathers in the day of my taking hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; because they abode not in my covenant, and I disregarded them</b> (many take the sentence beginning with <b>because</b> as an independent one—“because they abode not in my<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>iy<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEBpq7XkTI2lxBvtggD3DwCtlqkpYLpm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

On the face of their not continuing in God's covenant, Delitzsch gives a striking quotation from Schelling, –“The Law appears to be the mere ideal of a religious constitution, as it has never existed in fact: in practice, the Jews were almost throughout polytheists. The substance of their national feeling was formed by heathendom; the accidents only, by revelation. From the queen of heaven down to the abominations of the Phoeniciaus, and even to Cybele, the Jews passed through every grade of paganism.” “In fact,” adds Delitzsch, “there is no period of the history of Israel before the captivity, in which more or less idolatry was not united with the worship of Jehovah, except the time of David and the first years of Solomon, during which the influence of Samuel still continued to be felt. And when by the captivity Idol-worship was completely eradicated from the people, as far at least as regards that part of it which returned, it is well known that a hypocritical letter-worship got the mastery over them, which was morally very little better.” See note on Matt. xii. 43. <b>10.</b></u></h2> <b>For</b> (the reason rendered is for the expression “<i>new</i>,” above: “<i>new, I say:</i> <i>for</i>…”) <b>this</b> (predicate, explained in what follows) <b>is the covenant which I will establish to the house of Israel</b> (Israel here in its wider sense, comprehending both Israel proper and Judah : because then all Israel shall be again united) <b>after those days</b> (after the end of that dispensation, when those days of disregard are over), saith the <b>Lord, giving</b> (or, <b>putting</b>.

Under the old covenant, the priests’ lips were to keep knowledge, and they were to teach the people God’s ways: under the new, there is no more need for the believer to have recourse to man for teaching in the knowledge of God, for the Holy Spirit, which is given to all that ask, reveals the things of Christ to each, according to the measure of his spiritual attainment and strength of faith.

I assume here that which I have there endeavoured to establish, that it is “James the Lord’s brother,” the first president or bishop of the church at Jerusalem, an Apostle, but not one of the Twelve), <b>servant</b> (not necessarily, as Huther, an official appellation; but implying, as he also confesses, devotion to God and His work alone, irrespectively of self-will or other men’s will) <b>of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ</b> (not “<i>of the God and Lord, J. C.,</i>” but, as Œcumenius, “by <b>God</b>, he means the Father: by <b>Lord</b>, the Son.” Huther remarks, that in all the addresses of Epistles, the whole name <i>Jesus Christ</i> is given. St. James mentions our Lord only here and ch. ii. 1 in this Epistle, and not at all in his speeches in Acts xv. and xxi. Bengel says, “It might have seemed, if he had often named Jesus, as if he did it to exalt himself as the brother of our Lord. For that very reason, he ‘knew Christ according to the flesh’ less than others”), <b>to the twelve tribes</b> (of Israel: nor can there be any reasonable doubt that this Epistle was addressed to Jewish Christians in the first place. Not however to them, as distinguished from Gentile Christians: for the two classes appear to have<br><br>been not as yet distinct. If the later date of the Epistle be taken [see Introd.], then the Jewish Christians are addressed as the nucleus and kernel of all Christendom. But to my mind, the former is more probable) <b>which are in the dispersion</b> (the most likely reference of this word is to the literal and actual Jewish dispersion: and the Epistle must be considered as addressed, from the head of the mother church in Jerusalem, to the Jewish believers, residing among the dispersed tribes of Israel), <b>greeting</b> (the formula thus rendered is not found in the address of any other apostolical Epistle; but it occurs in the Epistle drawn up under the direction of James to the Gentile churches in Acts xv. 23).<h2><u><b>2—12.</u></h2></b> <i>Exhortations regarding the endurance of trials</i>. <b>Think it all joy</b> (the word <i>joy</i> is taken up out of the word rendered greeting, which literally means <i>to rejoice</i>. It is a characteristic of the style of this Epistle thus to take up again words just used: so “endurance. But let endurance,” ver. 3, 4: “deficient… is deficient,” ver. 4, 5: “doubting… he that doubteth,” ver. 6: “slow to wrath : for the wrath,” ver. 19, 20: “the implanted word… but be ye doers of the word,” ver. 21, 22; “that man’s religion is vain… pure religion,” ver. 26, 27, &c., &c. <b>all joy</b>, i.e. all conceivable joy—a matter on all hands<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VU6jJlYuTzaLyumoMrpJt2BtWIL1uFrT/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It betokens community of origin and of faith), <b>whensoever ye fall into various temptations</b> (these are not only what we properly call <i>temptations</i>, but any kind of distresses which happen to us, from without or from within, which in God’s purpose serve as <i>trials</i> of us: the latter word being, in this its now common general meaning, a word derived from the Christian life. See 1 Pet. i. 6, which is strictly parallel): <h2><u><b>3.</b></u></h2> <i>ground of this joy:</i> <b>knowing</b> (as you do) <b>that the proof ‘of your faith worketh endurance (per- severance:</b> more than patience. But does not St. Paul, Rom. v. 3, 4, state precisely the converse, viz. that “<i>tribulation worketh endurance, and endurance approval?”</i> Doubtless: but it is really the same that is said: <i>tribulation</i> there is equivalent to <b>proof</b> here. As De Wette observes, the thought is not carried to its end as in Romans, but the Apostle breaks away at <i>endurance</i> to exhort respecting it).<h2><u><b>4.</b></u></h2> <b>But</b> (as if it had been said, and be not weary of enduring: but) <b>let endurance have a perfect work</b> (the allusion seems to be to our Lord’s saying, Matt. xxiv. 13, “<i>He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</i>” So that the words are to be taken simply and literally; <b>endurance</b> as the abstract, mere endurance, and <b>work</b> as the work wrought out by <i>endurance</i> in its continuance. And <b>perfect</b> is not to be understood as <i>enduring to the end</i>, but in its ordinary sense of ‘perfect,’ fully brought out and accomplished), <b>that ye may be perfect</b> (for the work of God in a man <i>is</i> the man. If God’s teaching by patience have had a perfect work in you, <i>you</i> are perfect: His is an <i>implanted word</i>, ver.21. And the purpose of that work is, to make us perfect) <b>and entire</b> (that in which every part is present in its place), <b>deficient in</b> <b>nothing </b>(the subjoining a negative corroboration to a positive clause is characteristic of St. James: compare vv. 5 aud 6).<h2><u>5.</u></h2> <b>But</b> (i.e., but this perfection and entireness, this defect in nothing, will not be yet attained; and you will find, when you aim at it, that you are lacking in the very first requisite) <b>if any of you is deficient in wisdom</b> (for what is meant by wisdom here, see ch. iii. 15–17), let him ask (either supply ‘<i>it</i>,’ or take the verb absolutely, which is better: so A. V., see below) <b>from God who giveth</b> (asking and giving are put forward as belonging to us and God in the abstract, and we do not want any object, as “<i>it</i>,” or “<i>wisdom,</i>” supplied) to <b>all men simply</b> (so Rom. xii. 8, “<i>He that imparteth, with simplicity:</i>” which is perhaps better than “<i>with liberality:</i>” we must here interpret by what follows, and understand it of simply giving, and adding nothing afterwards which may take off from the graciousness of the gift) <b>and upbraideth not</b> (in what sense is rather doubtful. Many interpret it of sending away with a refusal: the word will not bear this meaning. By far the greatest part of Commentators understand it of reproaching by the recounting of benefits bestowed. But this again does not reach the full and general nature of the expression here. The real meaning here is just as in Ecclus. xx. 15, “He giveth little, and upbraideth much,” and in Ecclus. xli. 22, “After thou hast given, upbraid not,” viz. upbraiding with any kind of reproaches, as God might well do, so unworthy are we to approach Him with any request. This of course would include that other), <b>and it shall be given to him</b> (viz, <i>wisdom</i>, see 3 Kings iii. 9–12.

Huther says well, “<i>Doubt</i> is not <i>unbelief</i> [Luke xxiv. 11], but includes in it the essential character of <i>unbelief:</i> while <i>faith</i> says ‘Yes,’ and <i>unbelief</i> ‘No,’ <i>doubt</i> is the union of ‘Yes’ and ‘No,’ but so that ‘No’ is the weightier: it is that inward giving way which leans not to <i>faith</i>, but to <i>unbelief</i>. ‘The deep-lying ground of it is <i>pride</i>”): <b>for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea</b> (see Eph. iv. 14 and Isa. lvii. 20) <b>driven by the wind and tossed about</b> (the word forms a synonym with the former, “<i>driven by the wind:</i>” and the use of these synonymous expressions so close to one another is again a characteristic of St. James. A good explanation of the figure is quoted by Wiesinger from Heisen: “Sometimes he is east on the shore of faith and hope, sometimes he is rolled back into the deep of distrust: now he is borne up into the height of worldly pride, now he is mingled with the lowest sands of desperation and trouble”): <b>for</b> (takes up and repeats the former <b>for</b>) <b>let not that man</b> (said with a certain slight expression of contempt) <b>think that he shall receive any thing</b> (viz. of what he asks: some things, as life, food, raiment, &c., he does continually receive) <b>from the Lord</b> (i.e. as usually in this Epistle, from GOD. So ch. iv. 10, 15; v.4, 10, 11: see at each of those places. On the other hand, “<i>the Lord,</i>” ch. v. 7, 14, 15, is used of Christ. Hofmann remarks that where the Father is not expressly distinguished from the Son by the context, the Godhead, in its unity, is to be understood by the word <b>God</b>: and the same may be said of <b>the Lord</b>).<h2><u><b>8.</u></h2> He is a man with two minds, unstable in all his ways</b> (such is the best way of taking this sentence, making it all predicate and all to apply to <b>that man</b> as its subject. The common way, to take “<i>a double-minded man</i>” as a new subject, as A. V. ‘a double-minded man is unstable,’ has this against it, that it makes the very unusual word “<b>doubled-souled,</b>” found here and in ch. iv. 8 for the first time in Greek literature, to be a mere usual epithet and word of passage).<h2><u><b>9.</u></h2> </b>The connexion appears to he this: we must not pray before God, we must not be before God, double-minded; in our trials, we shall get no heavenly wisdom, if this is so. This double-mindedness, one soul drawn upwards to God, the other drawn downwards to the world, causes nothing but instability, and cannot result in that joy which is to be <i>our </i>attitude in trial. And it arises from misapprehension of our appointed state in trial: the poor and humble forget the exceeding honour thus done to him, which ought to be to him ground of boasting, far more worthy than (see below) the rich in this world have in their riches which shall so soon fade away: whereas (ver. 12) he that is tried shall receive a crown of life from the Lord. <b>But </b>(contrasted with the <i>double-mindedness </i>above) <b>let the brother</b> (the Christian believer) <b>who is low</b> (poor and afflicted; not merely, low in station: this explanation disappears with the view that <i>the rich man</i> [below] is Christian also) <b>glory in his exaltation</b> (which he has obtained by being admitted into the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings, and which he has further in reversion in the glorious crown of life hereafter, ver. 12): <b>but the rich </b>(not the rich <i>brother,</i> nor is the rich to be understood any otherwise than in the rest of the Epistle, compare ch. ii. 6f., v. 1ff. There are difficulties either way; but on mature consideration I find those on the usual hypothesis, of the <i>rich man being also a brother</i>, insuperable. For in that case 1) a most unnatural change in the sense is necessary at “<i>because:</i>”—‘Let the rich brother glory in his humiliation, for, or because, <i>considered merely as a rich man,</i> &c.”’ So that he is a Christian<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SnOz32zHdwcKmWJ4Xm4S-6YmuTvevM1b/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Whereas on the other view the difficulties are no more than arise from a confessedly elliptical parallelism. After <b>the rich</b> we must supply <i>glorieth:</i> ‘let the <i>low</i> glory in his exaltation, whereas the rich ran glories in his debasement,’ compare Phil. iii. 19, “<i>whose glory is in their shame</i>”) <b>glories</b> (see above) <b>in his humiliation</b> (see Phil. iii, 19, above,—in that which is in reality his debasement, just as in the other case the lowly Christian is called on to boast in what is in reality his exaltation. Thus, and thus only, the parallelism coheres. On the ordinary view, the <i>exaltation</i> of the <i>low brother </i>is, that which is really but not apparently his exaltation, whereas the <i>humiliation</i> of the <i>rich brother</i> is that which is apparently but not really his debasement); <b>because as a flower of the grass he shall pass away. </b><h2><u><b>11.</b></u></h2> <b>For</b> (justification of the last words) <b>the sun arose</b> (it is given in the form of a tale, a narration of what happened and ever does happen: see Isa. xl. 7, from which the whole is adapted) <b>with the heat</b> (or, the hot east wind: this interpretation seems approved by the Greek of Jonah iv. 8, where the same word is used for that which we render “<i>a vehement east wind.</i>” I prefer the other meaning, the arid scorching which accompanies the increasing power of the sun), <b>and dried up the</b> <b>grass, and the flower thereof fell away</b> (all from Isaiah), <b>and the beauty of its appearance</b> (literally, <i>face</i>, i.e. external appearance) <b>perished: thus also shall the rich man</b> (the same as was spoken of ver. 10) <b>wither</b> (the verb continues the similitude) <b>in his ways</b> (Ps. lxviii. 24; and Prov. ii.8). <h2><u><b>12.</b></u></h2> We now return to the suffering and tempted Christian, who has his <i>blessedness</i>, and a possession more precious and more sure than worldly wealth. <b>Blessed is the man who endureth</b> (the emphasis is on this verb, which distinguishes this saying from that in ver. 2; it is not the mere <i>falling among temptations,</i> but the <b>enduring</b> <i>temptation</i>, which is felicitated) <b>temptation: because when he has become approved</b> (by the trial: when he has undergone the <i>proof</i> ver. 2) <b>he shall receive the crown of life (of life</b> is genitive of apposition: the crown <i>is</i> life eternal. No image derived from <i>athletes</i> must be thought of in the verse, as is done by many: such an image would be foreign to the ideas of Jews, with whom the receiving a crown from God was a familiar image, irrespective of any previous contest for a prize: see Ps. xxi. 3; Wisd. v. 16, “<i>They shall receive the kingdom of glory and the diadem of beauty from the hand of the Lord</i>”), <b>which He promised to them that love Him</b> (<i>who</i> promised it, is understood: God, repeatedly, in substance: whenever a kingdom is foretold as the future inheritance of His people: <b>to them that love Him</b>, 2 Tim. iv. 8; and the same words again in ch. ii. 5.

There is no warrant for changing in the slightest degree the reference of the word. The <i>temptation</i> is a trying of the man by the solicitation of evil: whether that evil be the terror of external danger, or whatever it be, all <i>temptation</i> by means of it arises not from God, but from ourselves —our own <i>lust</i>.

Thus the man would transfer his own responsibility to God. There does not seem to be any allusion to the fatalism of the Pharisees, as some seem to think: the fault is one of common life, and is alluded to Ecclus. xv. 11, “<i>Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away”</i>): <b>for God is unversed in things evil</b> (the meaning usually given, “<i>untempted,</i>” or “<i>not able to be tempted,</i>” is against the usage of the word. Besides, there is no question here of God <i>being tempted</i>, but of God <i>tempting</i>. It seems that we must take refuge in the ordinary meaning of the word, and render it ‘<i>unversed in,</i>’ having no experience of), <b>but HE tempteth no man: but each man is tempted, being</b> (slightly causal, ‘in that he is’) <b>drawn out and enticed by</b> (it is the same preposition in the Greek as above, ver. 13: the source rather than the agent : but we cannot here render it <i>from</i>, as the sentence would thus become ambiguous) <b>his own lust</b> (James is not here speaking of the <i>original</i> source of sin in man, but of the actual source of temptation to sin, when it occurs. The “<i>sin</i>” of St. Paul, the sinful principle in man, is not here in question: we take up the matter, so to speak, lower down the stream: and the <i>lust</i> here is the <i>lust</i> there, itself the effect of sin [abstr.] in the members, and leading to sin [concrete] in the conduct): <h2><u><b>15.</b></u></h2> <b>then lust having conceived, bringeth forth sin: and sin, when completed, bringeth forth death</b> (it has been questioned whether <b>sin</b> is here in one, or in two senses. De Wette holds that the first <b>sin</b> is the purpose, or inner act, of sin,—the <i>completion</i>, carrying this <i>sin</i> out into an act, which act brings forth death, the wages of sin. But this is decidedly wrong. Wiesinger has disputed it, and insisted rightly that the <i>inner act</i> is the union of the will with the <i>lust</i>, the “<i>bringing forth</i>” denoting extrusion into outward act: then the second <i>sin</i>,—which Huther rightly maintains to be the sinful act when brought to perfection in all its consequences, in a series of results following on one another and bringing a man under bondage to his sin,—being thus perfected, brings forth eternal death. The imagery is throughout consistent. The harlot <b>lust draws away</b> and <b>entices</b> the man: the guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the consequence is that she<b> conceives sin</b>, sin, in general, of some kind, of that kind to which the temptation inclines : then [so literally], <b>the sin</b>, that particular sin, when grown up and mature, herself <b>bringeth forth</b>, as if all along pregnant with it, Death, the final result of sin. So that <i>temptation to sin</i> cannot be from God, while <i>trial</i> is from Him. The one, being our proof, works endurance, and endurance, when she has a perfect work, life: the other, being a bait and excitement arising from lust, “brings forth sin, and sin being completed, brings forth <b>death.</b>” The English reader will not fail to remember Milton’s sublime allegory in Paradise Lost, where Satan, by his<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nCt7gYZWCTsyudfwlLq28uf7kB-IljBk/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But so far is it from this being so, that <i>He is the Author of all good.</i> <b>Do not err</b> (some have ended the paragraph with these words : some have begun a new one. But this formula thus used seems invariably to look to what follows), <b>my beloved brethren</b> (both this earnest address, and the caution, shew how important the Writer feels this to be, which he is about to enunciate) : <b>every good gift</b> (properly, <i>act of giving</i>) <b>and every perfect gift</b> (properly, <i>thing given</i>.

If on the other hand they are said of God, “it seems strange that after a change of reference from the preceding “<i>Him</i>,” another subject should be expressed in ch, iii. 1 by the words “<i>the Father</i>.” In consequence of these difficulties, some have referred <b>he is righteous</b> to Christ, and <i>of</i> <b>Him </b>to God; which cannot well be. It would be possible, doubtless, to understand the whole of Christ, without change of subject from ver. 28; and to leave the words <b>is born of Him</b> as we find them. If it occurs nowhere else in reference to Christ, there is in it nothing abhorrent from our Christian ideas. And in St. John’s sense of the intimate union between the Father and Son, he who is born of the Father might be said to be born of the Son also. But after all, the other view, which is that of most ancient expositors, must, I apprehend, be adopted. The analogy of the passage, as shewn in ch, iii. 1, 2, 9, 10, fixes the words <b>is born of Him</b> to birth from God: and the absence in the original of a new expressed subject in the words <i>is</i> <i>righteous </i>must be accounted for by remembering that this verse, as ch, i. 5, is the opening, and general statement, of a new section of the Epistle. And the essential unity of the Father and the Son comes in on this side also: so that the judgment alluded to ver. 28, which shall be executed by the Son, being judgment committed to Him by the Father, brings to mind the justice and righteousness in which that judgment is founded): <b>ye know that also every one who doeth righteousness</b> (literally, <b>the righteousness</b>, <br><br>i.e. the righteousness which is implied in the word “<i>righteous</i>” above: if it were not too strong, we might almost say, “that righteousness :” the article showing that there is no other. <b>doeth</b>, for all righteousness is energetic: it springs out of holiness, truth, love), <b>is born</b> (hath been begotten) <b>of Him</b> (God: see above: <i>for the righteous begetteth righteous progeny.</i> The inference here must be carefully kept to the Apostle’s words and obvious sense. And those require that we should understand it thus: God is <i>righteous</i>. This is our axiom, from which we set out, And if so, then the <i>source of</i> righteousness. When therefore a man doeth righteousness, <i>we know</i>, we apprehend, we collect, from our previous knowledge of these truths, that the source of his righteousness is God: that in consequence he has acquired by new birth from God, that righteousness which he had not by nature. We argue from his <i>doing righteousness</i> to his <i>having been begotten of God</i>. And the right apprehension of this is the more important because the whole mass of Socinian and Pelagian Commentators have reversed the members of the argument, and made it conclude that <i>doing</i> <i>righteousness </i>is the condition, on our part, of <i>becoming </i>a child of God. And the Roman-Catholic expositors, while they avoid this error, yet go equally wrong, in understanding “<i>hath been begotten</i>” not as the statement of a past and abiding fact, but as the ground of a confidence as to the future).<h1><u><b>CHAP. I. 1—10.</b></u></h1> <i>The true and distinguishing signs of the children of God and the children of the devil</i>. <h2><u><b>1–3.</b></u></h2> The foundation and source of all righteousness in us is, the essential righteousness of God. All our doing of righteousness is a mere sign that He has begotten us anew— that we are His children. And what great things are contained in this name—how precious treasures of faith, of hope, of love! On this thought the Apostle now enters. He places the whole glory of the children of God before his readers. The being righteous as He is righteous, is the token of that new birth, and the measure of the life which began with it: the striving to perfect and mature this token, to fill up this measure, is an additional proof that a man is of God. <h2><u><b>1.</b></u></h2> <b>Behold </b>(as in John i. 29; xix. 5, does not express the Writer’s own astonishment, but directs the attention of those who are addressed. But there immediately follows upon us, the communicative address, so that in fact the Apostle does in a manner include himself among those addressed in <b>behold</b>), <b>what manner of </b>(including “how great,” “how free,” “how precious”—in fact, all the particulars which are afterwards brought out respecting this love: see ver. 16, ch. iv. 9, 16) <b>love </b>(is <b>love </b>here, joined as it is with the verb “<i>hath bestowed</i>,”<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5-1GtaNfCJMl4VtdwMqLgOu25K4Yd0a/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

There seems no necessity for diverting the word from its proper meaning. As in ch. iv. 9, the proof of the love is that which is imported, not by the love itself, but by the verb joined with it; as by “<i>was manifested</i>” there, so by “<i>hath bestowed</i>” here) <b>the Father</b> (spoken here not, as some think, of God in general, the whole three Persons in the blessed Trinity, but personally, of the Father, as distinguished from the Son, in whom we have received our adoption) <b>hath given</b> (see above) <b>unto us, that</b> (how is <b>that </b>here to be taken ? is it to be kept to its strong sense, indicating that our being called the children of God is the <i>purpose </i>of that gift of love just spoken of, or does it, as so often in St. John, introduce the <i>purport </i>of that love, stated in the form of an end to be gained by its manifestation ? Lücke and others keep the strong telic sense. “What great love,” says Lücke, “hath the Father shewn us [viz, in sending His Son, ch. iv. 10], <br><br>in order to make us children of God!” But the objection to this is, that thus a proof of the divine Love is hinted at in our verse which is not, expanded, but is left to be gathered from elsewhere : and the purpose introduced by <b>that </b>becomes the secondary and remote subject of the sentence, whereas, from the idea of <b>children of God</b> taking up the preceding idea of <i>birth from God</i>, and being again taken up in ver. 2, it is evidently the primary subject. The other meaning is taken by the ancient Greek expositors ; “wbat manner of love . . . resulting in, proved by, our being, &c.” The effect of the love, that at which it is aimed in its immediate bestowal, is, that we should be called children of God: its ultimate purpose is another thing. See vv. 11, 23, where we have the same construction) <b>we</b> <b>should be called children of God</b> (why has the Apostle rather used <b>should be called</b> than “<i>should be?</i>” Probably to bring forward the title, the reality of which, notwithstanding its non-recognition by the world, he is about to assert immediately). <b>And WE ARE [so]: for this cause the world</b> <b>doth not know</b> (apprehend, recognize) us; <b>because it did not know Him </b>(viz. Christ. —The insertion of the words, <b>and we are so</b>, appears to serve the purpose of bringing out the reality of the state conferred upon us with this title, in spite of any non-recognition of it by the unbelieving world. This clause is of the highest possible significance. On its assertion depends the <b>therefore </b>which follows: and we ARE God’s children : for <i>this very reason</i>, because we bear not the name only but the essence, the world knows us not: and then, as a reason for this ignorance following on this reality of our derivation from Him,—because it knew Him not. The reality of a believer's sonship of God, and his non-recognition by the world, are thus necessarily connected together. But Whom did the world not know, and when? <b>Him </b>here, by the very requirements of the logic of the passage, must be the Father, who not being recognized, neither are His children ; Augustine and others understand <i>Christ</i>. But this can only be, if we understand that the world rejected that revelation of the Father which was made by Christ His Son. And if we introduce this element, we disturb the strictness of the argument. It is the world’s ignorance of God, considered as one great act of non-recognition, disobedience, rebellion, hate, which makes them incapable of recognizing, loving, sympathizing with, those who are veritably children of God: compare ch. v. 1).<h2><u><b>2.</b></u></h2><b> Beloved, now are we children of God </b>(the world recognizes ns not: but our sonship is real: none the less real, that we ourselves know not our future condition in all its manifestation.

So most of the ancients and moderns. On the other hand, Bede, Calvin, Beza [and the A. V.: Tyndale and Cranmer had <i>“it”</i>), and others, supply <i>“He,”</i> understanding <i>Christ:</i> appealing to St. John’s well-known usage which we have in ch. ii. 28, and below in our ver. 5. But it may be replied, that in the former case the subject was plainly suggested by the preceding words <i>“in Him,”</i> in the latter actually expressed : whereas here the reference of the verb is no less plainly given by the preceding verb, here again repeated. Besides which, <i>“He,” </i>in ver. 5, clearly shews that the divine subject of these verses is not Christ but the Father), <b>we shall be</b> (taken up again from above, and the emphatic <b>like Him </b>corresponding exactly to <b>what</b> above) <b>like Him </b>(<i>God:</i> see below), <b>because </b> (this connecting particle must be kept firm to its causal meaning, and all the difficulties of the sentence met thus, not by explaining it away. Nor does it express merely the <i>mode </i>of the transformation, as Lyra. Still less must we with Calvin and others reverse the causal connexion, and make the seeing Him as He is merely a proof that we shall be like Him. Whatever consequences it may entail, it is certain that the proposition introduced by <i>because </i>contains the real essential cause and ground of that which it follows) <b>we shall see Him</b> (God : see below) <b>as He is </b>(with St. John, the recognition and knowledge of God is ever no mere cognition, but the measure of the spiritual life: he who has it, possesses God, has the Father and the Son: becomes more and more like God, having His seed in him. So that the full and perfect accomplishment of this knowledge in the actual fruition of God Himself must of necessity bring with it entire likeness to God. And this is the part of the future lot of the sons of God which is certain. Because we shall see Him as He is, —which is taken for granted as a Christian axiom,—it of necessity follows that we shall be entirely like Him: ethically like Him: we shall behold, as Ecumenins says, “the just, the just One—the pure, the pure One.” The difficulty, that no man can see God, is not in reality contained here, any more than it is in our Lord’s “ Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall <i>see </i>God.” The word, however understood, has for its limit, that no created eye even in the glorified body can behold the Creator: that beyond its keenest search there will be glory and perfection baffling and dazzling it: but this incapacity does not prevent the vision, as far as it can reach, being clear and unclouded: being, to the utmost extent of which our glorified nature is capable, <i>as He is</i>—a true and not a false vision of God. And if it be again objected that we seem to be thus confounding the ethical sight of God which is the measure of our likeness to God, with corporeal sight of Him in the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CsSZfBJ_XWc0HROouyPlPCJePsm-LjZy/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

We are speaking of things which eye hath not seen, nor mind conceived: what a <i>spiritual body </i>may imply, our ideas now do not enable us to conceive: but I suppose it must at all events be a body, all of whose senses are spiritually conditioned and attuned : that what <i>physical capacities</i> are to our bodies here, <i>spiritual capacities</i> will be there: and feeling this, however little I may know of the details of the great fact, it removes from me all insuperable difficulty as to the words <i>“we shall see Him as </i>He <i>is.”</i> “I know that in my flesh I shall see God,” may not be the right expression in Job, but it is the expression of my hopes as a son of God: it is the one expression of a hope in which all other hopes culminate and centre. And every son of God knows, that for it ever to be fulfilled, he must be growing onward in likeness to Him, pure, even up into His purity: for in His light only shall we see light.<br><br>One point only must be noticed before passing onward; the fact that several of the great interpreters understand <b>Him </b>both times of <i>Christ</i>. This has partly of course been occasioned by their supplying Christ as a subject to the verb <i>“shall appear,”</i> or <i>“shall be manifested,”</i> above. Augustine has one of his most beautiful passages, explaining how at Christ’s appearing, the impious shall see only <i>the form of a servant</i>, but we <i>the form of God</i>. The whole view, however, does not satisfy the requirements of the passage. It is the<i> children of God</i> who are addressed : and the topic of exhortation is, that they be righteous as God their Father is righteous).<b> </b><h2><u><b>3.</b></u></h2><b> And every one that hath this hope </b>(viz. that of being like Him hereafter) <b>on Him </b>(i.e. rested and grounded on God. In God, and grounded on His promises, is all our hope), <b>purifieth himself</b> (these words are not to be taken in any Pelagian sense, as if a man could of himself purify himself: “apart from me,” says our Lord, “ye can do nothing.” John xv.5. The man who purifies himself has this hope resting upon God. This mere fact implies a will to purify himself, not out of, nor independent of, this hope, but ever stirred up by, and accompanying it. So that the will is not his own, sprung out of his own nature, but the result of his Christian state, in which God also ministers to him the power to carry out that will in self-purification, See 2 Cor. vii. 1, which is remarkably parallel: and 1 Pet. i. 21, 22. The idea is much the same as that in ch. i. 9: it is entire purification, not merely from unchastity, but from all defilement of flesh and spirit), <b>even as He is pure</b> (Who is intended by <b>He? </b>Clearly below in ver. 5, Christ, from the facts of the case. But is it as clear here? Almost all the modern Commentators assume it, and the inference is upheld by a first view of ch. ii, 6, where much the same expression is used, and used of Christ. But there are some weighty considerations against the view. First, it is the <i>Father</i>, of whom it is written, “Be ye holy, for [or as] I am holy,” 1 Pet. i. 15, 16, Levit. xi. 44, xix. 2: compare also Matt. v. 48. Secondly, it would be very harsh thus to introduce a new subject, in the face of this Scripture usage. Thirdly, it would be against the whole spirit of the context: in which sonship of God and likeness to God are joined together, and the hopes belonging to the state are made motives for the duty. Fourthly, if it be asserted that Christ is our Pattern, in whom we see the Father’s purity shewn forth; I answer that this would be perfectly intelligible, if allusion was made, as in ch. ii. 6, to some historical manifestation in our Lord’s life: but being as it is in the present tense, it refers to the essential divine attribute of purity: and if so, then to that attribute in ary inherence in the Father. For these reasons and others which may be seen in my Greek Testament, I would interpret <b>He </b>here of the Father, in whom essentially abides this perfection of purity, and after continual increase of likeness to whom his sons, having the ultimate hope of being completely like Him, will be striving. In ver. 5, the case is otherwise : see there, and also on ver. 7).<h2><u><b>4-10</b></u></h2> T<i>he irreconcilability of sin with the work of redemption, with communion with Christ, and with being born of God.</i> The difficulty has been, to mark distinctly the connexion with the foregoing.

Now, the Apostle comes to treat its negative side: the incompatibility of sin with birth-from-God. And this he deals with essentially and in the ideal, as always. The whole is in the closest connexion with the foregoing, and is developed step by step with the minutest precision, as will be seen in the exegesis.<h2><u><b>4.</b></u></h2> In this verse we have verse 3 taken ap from the opposite side. There, God’s essential purity formed a law, according to which the child of God having hope of ultimate complete likeness to Him, purifies himself. Here we have it declared that the sinner goes counter to [this and all other] law: indeed the two terms, sin and lawlessness, are synonymous and convertible. <b>Every one that committeth sin, </b> <b>also committeth transgression-of-law: and sin</b> (abstract and in general) <b>is transgression-of-law </b>(abstract and in general. The assertion amounts to the identification of the terms, and the <b>is </b>amounts to “is equivalent to.”<br><br>This being so, <i>what is it exactly that our verse asserts</i> respecting these two things, sin, and transgression-of-law ? First and obviously, no appropriation must be made, in this verse and throughout this passage, of the word <b>sin </b>to <i>one kind </i>of sin, whether it be mortal sin as distinguished from venial [so the Roman-Catholic expositors], or notorious and unrepented sins, or sins against brotherly love [as Luther, and Augustine]. The assertions are all perfectly general, and regard, in the true root and ideal, every sin whatever. Every sin whatever then is a transgression of God’s law : as indeed its very name in Greek implies: <i>to sin </i>being to <i>miss a mark</i>, and the mark being that will of God which is the <i>law </i>and <i>aim </i>to him who “doeth the will of God,” ch. ii. 17).<h2><u><b>5.</b></u></h2><i> Additional argument </i>for the incompatibility of sin with the life of God’s children: that He, Christ, in and by whom we have this adoption (John i. 12), and by being in whose likeness alone we can be perfectly like God, was manifested to take away all sins, being Himself sinless. <b>And ye know </b>(the Apostle assumes it as known by those who had an anointing from the Holy One and knew all things ch. ii. 20) <b>that He</b> (now clearly Christ, from the context, which [see above on ver. 3] can alone decide the reference in each case) <b>was manifested</b> (viz. by His appearing in the flesh, and all that He openly and visibly did and taught in it, or may be known, by the Spirit, to have done and taught) <b>in order that He may </b>[might] <b>take away </b>(in the original, “take away by one act and entirely.” The meaning, <i>“take away,”</i> and not <i>“bear,”</i> is necessitated here by the context. Sin is altogether alien from Christ. He became incarnate that He might blot it out: He has no stain of it on Himself, If we render the word <i>“bear,”</i> this coherence is lost. Of course this fact is in the background, that He took them away by bearing them Himself: but it is not brought out, only the antagonism between Him and sin. See, on the word, the note on John i. 29) <b>sins </b>(<i>all</i> sins, not merely certain sins. The object of His manifestation is stated not only categorically, but definitively. Compare the striking parallel, Heb. ix. 26): <b>and in Him sin is not </b>(as His work, in being manifested, was, altogether to take away sin, so likewise is He himself free from all spot of sin. On the perversions and misunderstandings of this verse by the rationalists, and by Calvin, see in my Greek Test.).<h2><u><b>6.</b></u></h2> The connexion see above. <b>Every one that abideth in Him </b>(this expression is not to be weakened down by any rationalistic interpretation a<i>s believing in Christ</i>, or <i>being joined in love to Christ. </i>This a man might be to an earthly friend : but could not be said to <i>abide in him</i>.

This all the best and deepest Commentators have felt: so Augustine and Bede, saying, “In so far as he abideth in Him, he sinneth not.” The two are incompatible: and in so far as a man is found in the one, he is thereby separated from the other. In the child of God i the hatred of sin; in the child of the devil the love of it; and every act done in virtue of either state or as belonging to either, is done purely on one side or purely on the other. If the child of God falls into sin, it is an act against nature, deadly to life, hardly endured, and bringing bitter repentance: it is as the taking of a poison, which if it be not corrected by its antidote, will sap the very springs of life. So that there is no real contradiction to ch. i, 8–10, ii. 2, where this very falling into sin of the child of God is asserted and the remedy prescribed. The real difficulty of our verse is in that which follows); <b>every one that sinneth hath not seen </b>(so literally : see below) <b>Him, neither hath known Him </b>(here it seems to be said that the act of sinning not only <i>so far </i>excludes from the life in God and Christ, but proves that that life h<i>as never existed </i>in the person so sinning. That this cannot be the meaning of the Apostle, is evident from such passages as i. 8–10, ii. 2, and indeed from the whole tenor of the Epistle, in which the words, <i>“now are we children of God,” </i> occur in combination with<br><br><i>“let no one deceive you,”</i> and the like: whereas if the above view were correct, the very fact of <i>being deceived</i> not only would cause them to cease from being <i>children of God</i>, but would prove that they never had been such. If then this cannot be so, what meaning are we to put upon the words? First observe the tense in which the verbs stand in the original. They are perfects, almost equivalent to our English present, by which I have accordingly rendered them. And the meaning will be, that the cutting off by an act of sin of the sight and knowledge of Christ, shews, and shews in proportion as it prevails, unreality in that sight and knowledge. See the force of the tense discussed in my Greek Testament.<br><br>As regards the relation of the words themselves, <b>seeth </b>and <b>knoweth</b>; some hold that there is no perceptible difference : but that the latter word fixes and specifies the necessarily figurative meaning of the former. Lücke would understand <i>“seeing” </i>of knowledge obtained by historical information, which matures and completes itself into <i>“knowing.”</i> But this seems hardly according to St. John’s practice, who uses <i>“seeing”</i> either of bodily sight [John i. 18, 1 John i. 1, &c., &c.],— or of an intuitive immediate vision of divine things, such as Christ has of the Father and heavenly things [John iii. 11, 32, vi. 46, viii. 38],—or of spiritual intuition gained by knowledge of Christ and the divine life [John xiv. 7, 9; 3 John 11]: and there can be little doubt that this last is the meaning here: and thus <b>neither </b>will retain its proper exclusive and climacteric force:<i> seeing</i> is a further step than <i>knowing </i>: a realization of Christ's personality and of the existence of heavenly things which is the result of spiritual knowledge: and thus the sinner “hath not seen Him, nor yet, nor even, known Him”).<h2><u><b>7, 8.</b></u></h2> <i>The contrast is again stated</i>, and introduced by a solemn warning not to be misled respecting it : and, as usually<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hXDKc_lVWdBdxzyqDZ_fBcMM6tKWt756/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This is altogether to invert the proposition of the Apostle, who is reasoning, not from the fact of doing good works to the conclusion that a man is righteous, but from the hypothesis of a man’s being a child of God, born of Him and like Him, to the necessity of his purifying himself and doing righteousness. And in doing this, he ascribes the <i>doing righteousness</i> to its source, and the <i>doing sin</i> to its source : the one man is of God, the other is of the devil. As Luther well says, “ Good works of piety do not make a good pious man, but a good pious man does good pious works. ... Fruits grow from the tree, not the tree from fruits.”<h2><u><b>8.</b></u></h2> <i>Contrast to ver.7</i>. He that doeth sin is of the devil (notice first “<i>he that</i> <b>doeth </b>[not, as the A. V. most unfortunately, ‘committeth”) sin,” as indicative not s0 much of individual acts as of a state, corresponding to <i>“he that doeth righteousness.”</i> And then the words, is of the <b>devil</b>, must not be rationalized away, as is done by those who deny the personal existence of the devil. It is the distinct opposite correlative of “is of God” [ver. 10, &c.], and implies a personal root and agency, just as much as that other does. But again, it does not imply any physical dualism on the part of the Apostle, “The devil made no one, begat no one, created no one,” says Augustine here; “but he who imitates the devil, as if born of him, becomes a son of the devil, by imitation, not by birth. All sinners are born of the devil, in so far as they are sinners. Adam was made by God: but when he consented to the devil, he was born of the devil, and begat all such as he himself was.” But be it observed, that we have here no such expression as <i>“hath been begotten of the devil,”</i> but only, <i>is </i>of the devil. In the case of the children of God, there is a definite time, known to Him, when they passed from death unto life [ch. ii. 29; iii, 14; v. 11; John i. 12; iii. 3 ff.; v. 24, &c.]: from which their new life unto God dates: but there is no such point in the life of those who are the children of the devil; no regeneration from beneath corresponding to that from above : the natural life of men is not changed hy seed of the devil as it is by seed of God. Rather may we say, that in those who are of the devil this latter change has never taken place. Since sin has come to reign in the world by man’s sin, our natural birth, which is properly and essentially a birth from God, a creation by the eternal Word, has become a birth from the devil: so that it is, as Bengel expresses it, “a, corruption, not a generation:” and there is no trace of a physical dualism in St. John’s doctrine: nay, the idea is at once precluded by the fact, that according to the Apostle [John i. 12] those who are children of God have become so from having been children of the devil): <b>because the devil sinneth from the beginning </b>(‘sinned in the beginning, and has never ceased to sin since.’ But the question meets us, what is <b>from the beginning?</b> Bede and others understand it of the beginning of all creation. Many Commentators, to avoid all chance of dualism, make it mean not from the time of his creation, but from that of his fall, understanding it of the beginning <i>of our world</i>. But again, others suppose the term to mark the beginning of the devil’s own apostacy : so Bengel, &c. And lastly, others again take it to mean, “from the time when any began to sin.” And this seems, when we compare John viii. 44, to be the true interpretation.

See on this subject, my Sermons on Divine Love, Serm. v. pp. 68 ff, “the First Sinner”). <b>To this end was the Son of God manifested</b><br><br>(viz. in His incarnation, pregnant with all its consequences), <b>that He might destroy</b> (do away, break up, pull down: the word is used of a building, or a law, or an organized whole) <b>the works of the devil</b> (what are these? Clearly, in the first place, works whereof the devil is the <i>author</i>: not merely <i>devilish works</i>. And then, are we to include in the list not only sins, which manifestly belong to it, but also the consequences of sin—pain, sorrow, death? The <i>fact </i>would be true if we did: for Christ hath abolished death [2 Tim. i. 10]. But the context seems to require that we should at all events keep death and the results of sin in the background, as no mention is made of them here, and sinful works are clearly in the Apostle’s mind. These works the whole <i>manifestation </i>of Christ. went directly to nullify: more especially His Death, in which His power over Satan reached its highest point,—the bruising of His heel, in which He bruised the Enemy’s head:—for it was in that, that He won for us that acceptance which is sealed by His glorification, and in virtue of which the Holy Spirit is given us, of whose work in us it is said that we<i> “by the Spirit mortify (put to death) the deeds of the body.”</i> Rom. viii. 13).<h2><u><b>9, 10.</b></u></h2> <i>The contrast taken up again</i>, and from the converse: he that is born of God cannot sin: he that does not righteousness, is not of God: i.e. is a child of the devil. Then we have the usual new particular, to give the transition note to that which is to follow,— including in this last category him that loveth not his brother. <b>Every one that is begotten of God, doeth not sin </b>(the meaning of this declaration has been treated of above, ver. 6. Here we meet it in its barest and plainest form—the two states, being begotten of God, and sin, absolutely excluding one another), <b>because His seed abideth in him </b>(i. e. because that new principle of life from which his new life has unfolded, which was God’s seed deposited in him, abides growing there, and precludes the development of the old sinful nature. Some of the ancients understood it of the <i>word</i> of God, as in the parable of the sower, Matt. xiii, 3 ff. This last interpretation has been impugned by all the moderns, but I cannot see that they have mado good their objection: the force of which amounts to this ; that the word of God is not so much the <i>Seed</i>, as <i>the means whereby the begetting to the new life takes place</i>. But whether we regard the generation of plants, or animal procreation, which latter is more in question here, what words can more accurately describe the office of the seed than these? and what is the word of God but the continually abiding and working seed of the new life, in the child of God? Nay, it seems to be that exactly of which we are in search: not the Holy Spirit, the personal agent; not the power of the new life, the thing begotten; but just that which intervenes between the two, the word, the utterance of God—dropped into the soul of man, taking it up by divine power into itself, and developing the new life continually. This is in the most precise and satisfactory sense the<i> seed of God</i> : and on this all Scripture symbolism is agreed: compare 1 Pet. i. 23, James i. 18. In fact the very passage which is the key to this, is John v. 38, “ <i>Ye have not His word abiding in you</i>.” Nor should any exception have been taken to the comparison with the parable of the Sower, for though the attendant circumstances of generation are different, the analogy is the same); <b>and he cannot sin</b> (no explaining away of this declaration must be at- tempted, as is done by Cornelins-a-lapide, who understands it of <i>deadly </i>sin; by Augustine and Bede, who confine the <i>to</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SVnyl30HbnCNez5_ZfVJ8P2cwdJNo6gJ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The Apostle is speaking not only of the ideal, but of the real state of those born of God: drawing the strongest possible contrast between the life of God and the life of sin, as excluding one another absolutely. And there is no contradiction between what is here said and ch. i. 8, 9; nay, rather that passage shews, by the strong desire to he cleansed from all sin, which it assumes, the same incompatibility as is here insisted on), <b>because he hath been begotten of God</b> (almost all the expositors, from the first times until now, make this <b>because</b> more or less represent <i>in as far as, or as long as</i>. It is true, the Apostle does not say, <i>“he cannot sin because he </i><b>was born</b> <i>of God:”</i> this would testify to a past fact, once for all occurring, without any reference to its present permanence: but he has said because he is [<b>hath been and continues</b>] <b>born</b>,—because he <i>has abiding in him</i> that his birth from God. So that the above-cited explanation, though falling far short of the real meaning, has at least a feeling after the truth of the Apostle’s assertion in it. The abiding force of this divine generation in a man, excludes sin: where sin enters, that force does not abide: the <i>having been born</i> is in danger of becoming a mere fact in the past, instead of a fact in the present: a lost life, instead of a living life. And so all such passages as this, instead of testifying, as Calvin would have this one do, to the doctrine of final perseverance of the regenerate, do in fact bear witness to the very opposite: viz., that, as the Church of England teaches, we need God’s special grace every day to keep us in the state of salvation, from which every act and thought of sin puts us in peril of falling away. <br><br>Before leaving this important passage, I must quote Düsterdieck’s concluding remarks. “The difference between the older and more modern expositors lies in this, that the former are more anxious to moderate the details of the Apostle’s sentiment, and to tone down his assertion. to the actual life of Christians, while the moderns recognize the full precision of the text as it stands, but then remind us that the ideal truth of the principle announced by St. John continually, so to speak, floats above the actual life of believers as their role and aim, and that, in so far, the Apostle’s saying finds in such actual life only a relative fulfilment. None however of all the expositors, who in any way has recognized the ideal character of St. John’s view, has overlooked the fact, that even in the actual life of all that are born of God there is something which in fall verity answers to the ideal words, ‘they cannot sin,’ The children of God, in whom the divine seed of their eternal life abides, have, in reality, a holy privilege,—they sin not, and they cannot sin, just in proportion as the new divine life, unconditionally opposed to all sin, and manifesting itself in godlike righteousness, is present and abides in them. Expositors of all theological tendencies, in all times, point to this, that the new life of believers, veritably begotten by regeneration from God, is simply incompatible with sin;— the life which essentially alienates the spirit from all sin, fills it with an irreconcilable hate against every sin, and urges it to an unceasing conflict against all unrighteousness. Luther excellently says, that a child of God in this conflict receives indeed wounds daily, but never throws away his arms or makes peace with his deadly foe. Sin is ever active, but no longer dominant: the normal direction of life’s energies in the believer is against sin, is an absence of sin, a no-will-to-sin and a no-power-to-sin. He that is born of God has become, from being a servant of sin, a servant of righteousness : according to the divine seed remaining in him, or, as St. Paul says, according to the inner man [Rom. vii. 15 ff.], he will, and he can work only that which is like God,— righteousness, though the flesh, not yet fully mortified, rebels and sins: so that even in and by the power of the new life sin must be ever confessed, forgiveness received [ch. i. 8 ff.], the temptation of the evil one avoided and overcome [v. 18], and self-purification and sanctification carried on”). <h2><u><b>10.</b></u></h2> <i>The continuation of the former argument:</i> with the insertion, in the latter half, of the new particular which is to form the argument of the next section.

Compare John viii. 44, Acts xiii. 10. Socinus remarks well, “From the Apostle’s words it may clearly enough be collected, that between the sons of God and the sons of the devil there are none intermediate”): <b>every one that doeth not righteousness </b>(see ch. ii. 29) <b>is not of God</b> (is not a child of God), <b>and he that loveth not his brother</b> (see below, these words pointing on to the next section).<h2><u><b>11—24.</b></u></h2> Of <i>brotherly love</i>, as the sum and essence of <i>righteousness</i>: as Christ’s command [ver. 11]: whereas in the world there is hate [12, 13]: bound up with life, as hate with death [14, 15]: finding its great pattern in Christ [16]; to be testified not in word only but in deed [17, 18]; as the ground of confidence toward God and the granting of our prayers to Him, being obedience to His will [19–22]; which obedience consists in faith and love [23], and is testified to by the witness of His Spirit [24].<br><br>Before entering on ver. 11, the latter half of ver. 10 must be considered, as belonging properly, in its sense, to this section, though in arrangement inseparable from the last. The <i>“and,”</i> which binds on the additional particular in the last clause, serves, as in ver. 5, to co-ordinate that clause with the foregoing : not in this case as excluded from the forementioned category, but as one in particular, taken out from among the general category, and put into a co-ordinate position with it. And it is thus put, as being the most eminent, and most of the nature of a summary, and criterion, of the rest, of any of those graces which are necessarily involved in <i>righteousness</i>. Augustine beautifully says, “Love alone distinguishes between the children of God and the children of the devil. All may sign themselves with the sign of cross of Christ: all may answer Amen: all may sing Halleluia: all may be baptized, may enter churches, may build the walls of the same: but the children of God are not distinguished from the children of the devil, except by Love.” And this love, thus constituted into the great test and touchstone, is necessarily the family love of brother for brother within the limits of those who are begotten of God. Universal love to man is a Christian grace —but it is not that here spoken of: it neither answers the description of the <i>“message”</i> given in ver. 11, nor corresponds to the context here in general, the drift of which is that a test of our belonging to God’s family is our love towards His children, who are our brethren in that family: cf. ch. v. 1 ff. But, while there can be no doubt that this is the right understanding of the brotherly love here insisted on, we incur at once a formal difficulty in applying this meaning to the negative or exclusive side of the test. He who does not love his brother, has in strict fact <i>no brother to love</i>, for he is not a child of God at all. Hence we must understand, strictly speaking, <i>“his brother”</i> in this case as importing his hypothetical brother : him who would be, were he himself a true child of God, a brother, and, if so, necessarily beloved. That this love does not exist in him, demonstrates him not to be of God’s family.<h2><u><b>11.</b></u></h2> <b>Because </b>(proof that absence of love of the brethren excludes from God's family)<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2atX4SJcbzSxljOmkanhPhTE4LoJhlN/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In the words <b>was of the wicked one</b> we have a resumption of the expression <i>“is of the devil”</i> from above, ver. 8: the word <b>wicked</b> being used probably on account of his being <i>of the wicked one</i> following. Observe, “his works were wicked” is the inference from that great proof which he gave of it by killing his brother: as is also the reason given in what follows: see below. So that here the assertion of his being of the wicked one is, aa above, strictly ethical, aud in no way physical or dualistic: “Cain was the son not of God but of the devil, <i>not by generation</i>, but by imitation and suggestion.” Cornclius-a-lapide). <b>And for what reason slew he him? because his [own] works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous</b> (it has caused some difficulty, that no mention of this ethical difference is made in the narrative in Genesis. It has been supposed that the Apostle gathers it from God’s differing acceptance of the offerings of the two: others have culled the ethical characters of the two the <i>previous</i> occasion, whereas the immediately exciting cause was the deduction from acknowledged facts, of the murder. But properly considered, the Apostle’s assertion here is only a <i>proximate </i>occasion. Cain murdered his brother: therefore he hated him: and hate belongs to the children of the evil one,— classes him at once among those whose works are evil, and who hate those who, like Abel, are testified to [Heb, xi. 4] that they are of the children of God who work righteousness. Whatever might. be the exciting occasion of the murder, this lay at the root —the hatred which the children of the devil ever bear to the children of God).<h2><u><b>13.</b></u></h2> The connexion with ver. 12 is close: the world (the children of the devil) began so, and will ever go on as it began. <b>Marvel not, brethren, if</b> (no <i>doubt </i>is expressed by this <i>if</i>. The hypothesis is set forth as actually fulfilled) <b>the world hateth you</b> (this verse is in close sequence on the example just given: Cain being taken as the prototype and exemplar of such hate).<h2><u><b>14, 15.</b></u></h2> See summary above, on ver. 11. The connexion with the foregoing is very close. We learnt from ver. 10, that the love of the brethren is that which makes manifest the children of God and the children of the devil. And now again, having spoken of the hate of the world as a thing to be looked for, the Apostle brings up this sign as one tending to comfort the child of God, and shew him that, notwithstanding the world’s hate, he has more to rejoice at than to fear from the fact: he is in life, they in death. <b>We</b> (emphatic: we whom the world hates: we, as set over against the world) <b>know </b>(see above, ver. 2: of <i>certain </i> knowledge) <b>that we have passed over out of death into life</b> (in the original it is, <b>out of the death into the life</b>—<i>the death</i>, which reigns over the unregenerate: <i>the life</i>, which is revealed in Christ), <b>because</b> (gives the ground and cause, not of the <i>having passed over</i>, but of the <i>knowledge</i> of having passed over) <b>we love the brethren</b> (here distinctly, our Christian brethren: the term being that well-known one<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-k3m4JtxaJ_Oz0jQZjfgebhvvDpIuBwi/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For the Romanist and Socinian distortions of this verse, curiously running into one, see note in my Greck Test. It may conduce to a right estimate of the doctrines of men and churches, and put younger Scripture students on their guard, to see the concurrent habits and tendencies of interpreters apparently so opposite. When Pilate and Herod are friends, we know what work is in hand. But as a conclusion, I will quote the clear and faithful exposition of a greater and better man: “What do we know? that we have passed from death into life. Whence have we this knowledge? because we love the brethren. Let no one interrogate a man: let every one have recourse to his own heart: if he find there brotherly love, he may be sure that he has passed from death into life. He stands already on the right hand: let it not trouble him that as yet his glory is hidden; when the Lord shall come, then shall he appear in glory. For he is growing, but as yet in winter: the root grows, but the branches are as it were dried up: within is the sap which grows, within are the leaves of trees, within are fruits, but they wait for summer”); <b>he that loveth not</b> (there is this time no qualifying object, as <i>“his brother:”</i> the absence of love from the character is the sign spoken of), <b>abideth in death </b>(as before, <i>“in the death:”</i> in that realm of death, in which all men are by nature. Here again the absence of love is not the reason, why he remains in death; but the sign of his so remaining, The <i>“passing over”</i> has not passed upon him. The words have no reference to <i>future</i> death, any further than as he who is and abides in death can but end in death: we may notice that he docs not say, he who loveth not shall come into death, as if he were speaking concerning eternal punishment, awaiting sinners in the future: but he says, <i>“he who loveth not abideth in death.”</i> Bede). <h2><u><b>15.</b></u></h2> <b>Every one that hateth his brother is a manslayer</b> (in these words, (1) <i>“he that loveth not,”</i> which preceded, is taken up by <b>every one that hateth</b>: shewing that the two are identical: the living spirit of man being incapable of a state of indifference: that he who has banished brotherly love has in fact abandoned himself to the rule of the opposite state. In the ethical depth of the Apostle’s view, love and hate, like light and darkness, life and death, necessarily succeed, as well as necessarily exclude, one another. He who has not the one of necessity has the other in each case. (2) he who hates his brother is stated to be a <i>manslayer</i>. The example given, ver. 12, shewed the true and normal result of hate: and again in the Apostle’s ethical depth of view, as in our Lord's own [ Matt. v. 21 ff, 27 fi.], he who falls under a state, falls under the normal results of that state carried out to its issue. If a hater be not a murderer, the reason does not lie in his hate, but in his <i>lack</i> <i>of </i>hate. “Whom we hate, we wish destroyed,” says Calvin. Some would make a <i>manslayer </i>mean, a destroyer of <i>his own</i> soul. But this, as well as the view that it is the murder of his brother’s <i>soul</i> which is intended, by provoking him to anger and discord,—errs by pressing the reference to the example of Cain above. Some again would interpret it by a reference to John viii. 44, understood as pointing to the ruin of Adam by the Tempter. But as Düsterdieck remarks, far rather should we say that this passage throws back a light on that passage, and makes it likely that the case of Cain, and not that of Adam, is <i>there </i>referred to); <b>and ye know that every manslayer hath not</b> (is without the possession of) <b>eternal life abiding in him</b> (<b>ye know</b>, viz. by your own knowledge of what is patent and axiomatic in itself. We must not fall into the error of referring the saying to the <i>future lot</i> of the murderer: it regards his present state, and is another way of saying that he <i>“abideth in death,” </i>ver. 14.

The love of God to us is not that which would, <i>as such</i>, be adduced as a pattern to us of brotherly love; it is true that in the depth of the matter, all true love is love after that pattern: but in a passage so logically bound together it is much more probable that the term common to the two, Christ and ourselves, would be, not divine love, which as such is peculiar to Him, but love itself simply, that of which He has given the great example which we are to follow), <b>that He</b> (Christ, as the words beyond question shew) <b>laid down His life for us</b> (i.e. <i>died</i>: not as Grotius, who in all the places where it occurs maintains that it is only to <i>expose life to danger</i>, which would entirely enervate the Apostle’s saying here. The term <b>for us</b> carries in it and behind it all that we know of the nature of the death which is spoken of: but the vicariousness and atoning power of Christ’s death are not here in consideration : it is looked on here as the greatest possible proof of love, us in John xv, 13): <b>and we</b> (emphatic: we on our part as followers of Christ) <b>ought on behalf of the brethren to lay down our lives</b> (on <b>lives</b>, Socinus says well: “ He says not, that we ought to lay down our ‘<i>life</i>,’ as if one were bound to die for many, but, our <i>lives</i>, because each ought to die for each.” The Apostle states the duty generally; and thus stated it is clear enough. As Christ did in pursuance of His love, so ought we to do in pursuance of ours, bound as we are to Him not by the mere force of an outward example, but by the power of an inward life. But naturally and necessarily the precept finds its aerate tion only in those cases where our Heavenly Father's will sets the offering of such a sacrifice in the course and pursuance of our brotherly love, which He has ordained). <b>17</b>.] <b>But </b>(“by the adversative connexion of ver. 17 with ver. 16 the Apostle marks the passage from the greater, which is justly demanded of us, to the lesser, the violation of which is all the more a transgression of the law just prescribed” Düsterdieck) <b>whosoever hath the world’s sustenance, and beholdeth</b> (the Greek word gives more than “<i>seeth</i>,” which would imply only the casual sight: it is the standing and looking on as a spectator: so that it ever involves not the eye only, but the mind also, in the sight: it is to <i>contemplate</i>, not simply to <i>see</i>. St. John is very fond of this word, and wherever it occurs, this its meaning may be more or less traced.

See also ch. ii. 5, where we have the same expression and reference to the love of God being in a man. The context indeed here might seem, as the mention of Christ’s love to us as so immediately preceded, to require the other meaning; or at least, that of “the love whereof God hath set us a pattern:” and accordingly both these have been held. But I see not how we can escape the force of the passages above cited) <b>abide in him</b> (Lücke and Düsterdieck are disposed to lay a stress on the word <b>abide </b>here, thereby opening a door for the view that the love of God may indeed be in him in some sense, but not as a firm abiding principle; that at all events at the moment when he thus shuts up his bowels of compassion, it is not <i>abiding </i>in him. But this world seem to violate the ideal strictness of the Apostle’s teaching, and the true sense rather to be, “How can we think of such an one as at all possessing the love of God in any proper sense?” giving thus much emphasis to the word <b>abide</b>. <br><br>Here again, as above in the case of the duty of laying down life for a brother, many questions of casuistry have been raised as to the nature and extent of the duty of almsgiving, on which it is impossible to enter here. The safest answers to them all will be found in the Christian conscience enlightened by the Holy Spirit, guiding the Christian heart warmed by the living presence of Christ) ?<h2><u><b>18.</b></u></h2> <i>Exhortation to true brotherly love: </i> following naturally on the example of the want of it given in the last verse. <b>Little children, let us not love with word, nor yet with tongue, but</b> (let us love) <b>in deed and truth</b> (there is some little difficulty in assigning these words their several places in the contrast. Notice first, that the two former, <b>with word</b> and <b>with tongue</b>, simply relate to the <i>instrument</i>, whereas the two latter are introduced by the preposition <i>in</i>, denoting the element in which. The trae account of the arrangement seems to be, that the usual contrast of <i>word </i>and <i>deed </i>is more sharply defined by the explanatory terms, <i>tongue </i>and <i>truth</i>: <b>with the tongue</b> giving, by making the mere bodily member the instrument, more precisely the idea of absence of truth than even <b>with word</b>, and <b>in truth</b> more definitely the idea of its presence than even <b>in deed</b>. As connected with the exhortation in this verse, I may cite the tradition reported by Jerome in his Commentary on Gal. vi. 10: “The blessed. John, the Evangelist, living on at Ephesus into extreme old age, and being with difficulty borne by the hands of his disciples to church, when he could not sustain his utterance for more words, used to say no more at each meeting than this: ‘Little children, love one another.’ At last his disciples and the brethren who were present, being wearied at hearing always the same words, said, ‘Master, why dost thou always go on saying this?’ The answer was worthy of St. John: ‘Because it is the Lord’s command; and if this ouly be done, it is enough’”).<h2><u><b>19—24.</b></u></h2> See the summary at ver. 11. <i>The blessed effects of trae brotherly love as a test of the Christian state. </i><h2><u><b>19, 20.</b></u></h2> [<b>And</b>] <b>in this </b>(see above, v. 1v0, 16.

To be in <b>the truth</b>, is a different matter from to be truthful or true men, Estius <i>approaches</i> the meaning, understanding <b>the truth</b> to be the truth of God in His promises, and so are <b>of the truth</b> to mean “are of the number of the elect.” Bede’s interpretation, “<b>of the truth</b>, which is <b>God</b>,” in which Calvin and others agree, is nearer still: but had the Apostle intended this, he surely would have written <i>“of God.”</i> The Lutheran commentators have come nearer still, making <b>the truth</b> to be <i>the word of truth</i> by which we are begotten anew unto God. But why stop at that which after all is <i>itself of</i> the truth? why not mount up to the Truth itself, that pure and objective Truth which is the common substratum and essential quality of the Spirit Himself, of the Word, of those who are born of the Word by the Spirit ?), <b>and shall persuade our hearts before him</b> (i.e. and in and by this same sign, shall still the questionings of our hearts before God, by the assurance that we are His true children. St. John uses <b>the heart</b> for the innermost seat of our feelings and passions: of alarm [John xiv. 1, 27], of mourning [xvi. 6], of joy [xvi. 22]. It was into the <i>heart </i>of Judas that the devil put the intent of betraying the Lord [xiii. 2]: and the <i>heart </i>here is the inward judge of the man,—whose office is, so to say, promoted by the conscience, accusing or else excusing [Rom. ii, 15]. Then, as to <b>shall persuade</b>, there is no need to give to the verb any unusual meaning. It does not mean “quiet” or “assure,” except in so far as its ordinary import, “persuade,” takes this tinge from the context.<br><br>It must be plain from what has been said, that the future, <b>shall persuade</b>, is not, on account of the words “<b>before</b> <b>Him,</b>” to be taken as referring to the future day of judgment, as some have done. In ch. iv, 17, which is in some respects parallel with this, that day is expressly named: whereas in our passage, an equally clear indication is given, by the parallelism of the two future verbs, <i>“shall know”</i> and <i>“shall persuade,”</i> that no such reference is intended. <b>before Him</b> is not, at His appearing, but, <i>in His sight</i>, as placed before His all-seeing eye.<h2><u><b>20.</b></u></h2> <i>takes up this matter of the persuading our hearts before God,</i> and <i>shews its true importance</i> and rationale. This is carried on in the following verses, but is here and in ver, 21 placed as its ground. If our heart, <i>before Him,</i> judges us unfavourably—we favourably still: if our heart condemn us not, again <i>before Him</i>, judging and seeing in the light of His countenance, then we know that we are at one with Him, and those consequences follow, which are set forth in ver. 22. The many difficulties which occur in <i>rendering </i>this verse cannot be presented to the mere English reader. They will be found discussed in my Greek Test. The context appears to stand thus. The Apostle in ver. 19 has said that by the presence of genuine love we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts in God’s presence. He then proceeds to enlarge on this <i>persuading </i>our hearts <i>in general</i>. If our heart condemn us, what does it import? If our heart acquit us, what? The <i>condemnation</i>, and <i>acquittal</i>, are plainly and necessarily <i>opposed</i>, both in hypothesis and in result. If the consolatory view of ver. 20 is taken,—as softening our self-condemnation by the comforting thought of God’s greatness and infinite mercy,—then the general result of vv. 20, 21 will be, whether our heart condemn us or not, we have comfort and assurance: and then what would be the import of our <i>persuading </i>our hearts at all? But on the other interpretation, the condemnatory sense of ver. 20—as intensifying our self-condemnation by the thought that the cause of it is God, knowing more of our sin than we do—then, taken with some modifications, all will be clear, I say, taken with some modifications : because the sense has been much obscured by the mistake of introducing the particular case treated in ver. 18 into the general statements of vv. 20, 21.

And then, having given the reason why the <i>condemnation </i>should be set at rest by the <i>persuasion</i>, he goes on to give the blessed results of the <i>persuasion </i>itself in vv. 21, 22). <h2><u><b>21.</b></u></h2> <b>Beloved </b>(there is no adversative particle, because this address throws up the contrast quite strongly enough, as introducing the very matter on which the context lays the emphasis, viz., the <i>persuading our hearts</i>), <b>if our heart condemn us not, we have confidence towards God</b> (said generally; not with direct reference to that which follows ver. 22, which indeed is one form of this confidence: see ch. v.14, where the connexion is similar. The confidence here spoken of is of course present, not future in the day of judgment. <b>towards God</b>, i.e., with reference to God: but more than that: to God-ward, in our aspect as turned towards and looking to God. <br><br>It must be remembered that the words are said in the full light of the reality of the Christian state,—where the heart is awakened and enlightened, and the testimony of the Spirit is active: where the heart’s own deceit docs not come into consideration as a disturb- ing clement), <h2><u><b>22.</b></u></h2> <b>and </b>(such another <i>“and”</i> as that in verse 10 above, where, after the general statement, <i>“and”</i> introduced the particular instance in which the general truth was carried forward. So here: By dwelling and walking in love, we can alone gain that approval of our conscience as God’s children, which brings real confidence in Him and real intercommunion in prayer, which is a result and proof of that confidence) <b>whatsoever wo ask, we receive</b> (present: not put for future, as Grotius thinks. The Apostle is setting forth actual matter of fact) <b>from Him </b>(these words must be taken in all their simplicity, without capricious and arbitrary limitations. Like all the sayings of St. John, they proceed on the ideal truth of the Christian state. “The child of God,” as Huther says, “asks for nothing which is against the will of its Father”), <b>because </b>(ground of the above <i>receiving</i>)<b> we keep His commandments, and do the things which are pleasing in His sight</b> (on the last expression [and parallelism] see Exod. xv. 26; also Deut. vi. 18, xii. 25, Ezra x. 11, Isa. xxxviii. 3. It is added, not as explanatory of <i>keeping</i> <i>His commandments,</i> but to connect with His granting our prayers, since our lives are in accord with His good pleasure. This however brings us to the theological difficulty of our verse, wherein it would seem at first sight as if the granting of our prayers by God depended, as its meritorious efficient, on our keeping of His commandments and doing that which pleases Him. And so some of the Roman- Catholic expositors here. But both here and elsewhere the solution of the difficulty is very easy, if separated from the party words of theology, and viewed in the light of Scripture itself.

The doing of such works is the working of the life of Christ in us: they are its sign, they its fruits: they are not of us, but of it and of Him. They are the measure of our Chistian life: according to their abundance, so is our access to God, so is our reward from God: for they are the steps of our likeness to God, Whatever is attributed to them as an efficient cause, is attributed not to us, but to Him whose fruits they are, <i>Because </i>Christ is thus manifested in us, God hears our prayers, which He only hears for Christ’s sake: <i>because </i>His Spirit works thus abundantly in us, He listens to our prayer, which in that measure has become the voice of His Spirit. So that no degree of efficacy attributed to the good works of the child of God need surprise us: it is God recognizing, God vindicating, God multiplying, God glorifying, His own work in us. So that when, e-g., Cornelius- a-lapide says, “It is congruous, and the congruous reward of obedience and reconciliation (friendship), that if man does the will of God, God in His turn should do the will of man,” all we can reply is that such a duality, such a reciprocity, docs not exist for Christians: we are <i>in God</i>, He in us: and this St. John continually insists on. We have no claim <i>from without</i>: He works in us to do of His good pleasure: and the works which He works, which we work, manifest before Him, and before all, that we are His children. The assertion, <i>“whatsoever we ask, we receive,” </i>I reserve to be treated of on ch. v. 14, 15, where it is set forth more in detail).<h2><u><b>23.</b></u></h2> <i>Summing up of all these commandments in one: faith in Christ, and brotherly love according to Christ’s command.</i> <b>And </b>(see <i>“and”</i> similarly used, ch. i. 5, ii, 17, iii, 3) <b>His commandment</b> (“he mentions,” says Bede, “ but <i>one </i>commandment, and then subjoins <i>two</i>, faith and love, as being inseparable the one from the other. For we cannot love one another rightly without the faith of Christ, nor can we truly believe in the name of Jesus Christ without love”) <b>is this, That we should believe the name</b> (this unusual expression is well explained by Calvin and Beza,—the word <i>“name”</i> has reference to the preaching of Him; so that to believe His Name is, to believe the Gospel message concerning Him, and Him as living in it, in all His fulness) <b>of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as He gave us commandment</b> (it seems natural, with the generality of Commentators, to understand Christ as intended by <b>He</b>, and by the commandment, John xiii. 34, xv. 12, xvi. 17).<h2><u><b>24a.</b></u></h2> <i>General return</i>, with reference to what has been said in the last verses, <i>to the great key-note of the Epistle,</i> <b>abide in Him</b>, with which the former part of it concluded, ch. ii. 28. This keeping of His (God’s) commandments is the abiding in God: this of which brotherly love is the first and most illustrious example and summary. So that the exhortation given at the beginning of this portion of the Epistle is still in the Apostle’s mind, as again ch. iv. 15, 16, and v. 20; see also ch. ii. 6, iii, 6, 9. <b>And he that keepeth His </b>(God’s) <b>commandments, abideth in Him </b>(God)<b>,</b> <b>and He</b> (God) <b>in him </b>(some hold that <b>He </b>and <b>Him </b>are to be referred to Christ. And no doubt they would be perfectly true, and according to our Lord’s own words, when thus applied : see John xiv. 15, xv. 5 ff. Still, from the context [see below], it is better to refer them to the chief subject, viz. to God. In the sense, the difference is not important. It is one of the most difficult questions in the explanation of this most difficult of Epistles, to assign such expressions as the present definitely to their precise personal object). <h2><u><b>24 b.</b></u></h2> And of one part of this mutual indwelling there is <i>a sign and token</i>, given us by God Himself, viz. <i>the Holy Spirit</i>.

The <i>giving </i>here took place at a certain time, by a definite act, viz. on the day of Pentecost, when the Father bestowed the Holy Spirit on the Church.

IV, 1—6.</b></u></h1> <i>Warning against, and criteria whereby to distinguish, false teaching.</i> This passage takes up again, with reference to this portion of the Epistle, the similar warning given in the former portion, ch. ii, 18 ff. It is intimately connected with what has immediately preceded. By brotherly love we are to know that we are of the truth, iii. 19,—and the token that He abideth in us is to be the Spirit which He gave us. This Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, it becomes then all-important for us to be able to distinguish, and not to be led astray by any false spirits pretending to his character and office. Such false spirits there are, which are not of God, but of the world, which make up that spirit of antichrist, of which prophecy had already spoken.<h2><u><b>1.</b></u></h2> <b>Beloved </b>(so ver. 7, and ch. iii. 2, 21, marking a transition to a subject on which the Apostle affectionately bespeaks their earnest attention), <b>believe not every spirit </b>(this expression, as also, <i>“the spirits,”</i> indicating plurality of spirits, we to be explained by the fact that both the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error speak by the spirits of men who are their organs. So we have, in reference to prophecy, 1 Cor. xiv. 32, <i>“The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.”</i> By the nature of the testimony of the human spirits, we shall know whether they are of God or not; whether they are organs of the <i>spirit of truth</i>, or of the <i>spirit of error</i>. It will be observed that this interpretation. of <i>“every spirit,”</i> and the Apostle’s way of speaking, rest on the assumption of there being One Spirit of Truth, from God, and one spirit of error, from the world; as opposed to all rationalizing interpretations, and also to all figurative understanding of the word.

That origin and source is the world, unregenerate human nature, ruled over and possessed by the devil, the prince of this world): <b>for this cause they speak of</b> (not <i>concerning</i>, but of, as <i>out of </i>and <i>from</i>; the material of what the say being worldly, Bengel) <b>the world, and the world heareth them</b> (loving as it does its own, who are of it, John xv. 18, from which our verse is mainly taken: see also John viii. 47, xviii. 37).<h2><u><b>6.</b></u></h2> <i>contrast</i>. <b>We</b> (emphatic, as opposed to them; but who are meant? The Apostles and their companions in the ministry, or all believers? Or again, all teachers of God’s truth, the Apostles included? It is hardly likely that the wider meaning has place here, seeing that 1) he has before said <i>“ye are of God,” </i>and 2) he is here opposing one set of <i>teachers </i>to another. On the other hand, it is not likely that he should confine what is said to the Apostles only: such as are mentioned with praise in 3 John 5–8 would surely be included) <b>are of God</b> (see above): <b>he that knoweth</b> (apprehendeth: hath any faculty for the knowledge of. The Apostle sets <b>him that knoweth God</b> in the place of <i>him that is of God</i>, as belonging more immediately to the matter in hand, the hearing, and receiving more knowledge. This <i>knowing God</i>, the apprehension aud recognition of God, is the peculiar property of God’s children, not any natural faculty in which one unrenewed man differs from another) <b>God heareth us: he who is not of God doth not hear us</b> (here we must remember carefully, what the context is, and what its purpose. The Apostle is giving a test to distinguish, not the children of God from those who are not children of God, but the spirit of truth from the spirit of error, as is clear from the words following. And this he does by saying that in the case of the teachers of the truth, they are heard and received by those who apprehend God, but refused by those who are not of God. It is evident then that these two terms here, <i>“he that knoweth God,”</i> and <i>“he that is not of God,”</i> represent two patent, matters of fuet,—two classes open and patent to all: one of them identical with the <i>world </i>above: the other consisting of those of whom it is said above, <i>“Ye know the Father”</i>. . . <i>“ye know Him that is from the beginning,”</i> ch, ii. 13, 14. How these two classes are what they are, it is, not the purpose of this passage to set forth, nor need we here enquire: we have elsewhere tests to distinguish them, ch. iii. 9, 10, and have there gone into that other question. We have a striking parallel, in fact the key to these words, in the saying of our Lord to Pilate, John xviii. 37). <b>From this</b> (viz., not the whole foregoing train of circumstances; nor, those tests proposed in vv. 2, 3: but the facts set forth in vv, 5, 6: the reception of the false teachers by the world: the reception of the true teachers by those that apprehend God, and their rejection by those who are not of God. ‘The same point is touched hy our Lord in John x. 8, <i>“but the sheep did not hear them”</i>) <b>we know </b>(in this unemphatic first person the Apostle includes his readers: we, all God’s children. <b>know,</b> <i>distinguish, recognize,</i> as so often) <b>the Spirit of truth</b> (the Spirit that cometh of God and teacheth truth) <b>and the spirit of error</b> (the spirit that cometh of the devil, teaching lies and seducing men into error see ch. i, 8, ii, 26).<h2><u><b>7—21.</b></u></h2> The Apostle again takes up his<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rS5dFCFJM3y1j3TDYxU6ZuLQAAX3n1A/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The great theme of the whole was enounced ch. ii. 29. The consideration of that has passed into the consideration of that righteousness in its highest and purest form of love, which has been recommended, and grounded on His love to us, in ch. iii. 11—18, where the testimony of our hearts came in, and was explained—the great test of His presence in us being the gift of His Spirit, iii. ult. Then from the necessity of distinguishing and being sure of that His Spirit, have been inserted the foregoing tests and cautions respecting truth and error. And now he returns to the main subject. The <i>knoweth God, is</i> and <i>hath been begotten of God,</i> the taking up again of God’s love to us in Christ at ver. 9 from ch. iii. 16, the reiteration of the testimony of the Spirit in ver. 13, all serve to shew that we are reading no collection of spiritual apophthegms, but a close and connected argument, though not in an ordinary style.<h2><u><b>7, 8.</b></u></h2> <b>Beloved</b> (as before, marks the fervency and affection of the Apostle turning to his readers with another solemn exhortation. Here the word is especially appropriate, seeing that his own heart is full of that love which he is enjoining), <b>let us love one another: because</b> (he at once rests the exhortation on the deepest ground) <b>love</b> (abstract, in the widest sense, as the following words shew) <b>is from God</b> (has its origin and source in God: He is the well-spring and centre of all love); <b>and every one that loveth</b> (there is no need to supply an object after loveth, as God is supplied in the Alexandrine MS., and <i>“his brother”</i> in some later versions: indeed to do so would be to narrow the general sense of the Apostle’s saying: all love is from God: every one that loveth, taking the word of course in its pure ideal sense in which the assertion follows from the former), <b>hath been begotten of God</b> (has truly received within him that new spiritual life which is of God: see note on ch. ii. 29), <b>and knoweth </b>(in his daily walk and habit, recognizes and is acquainted with God: by virtue of that his divine birth and life)<b> God</b>:<h2><u><b>8.</b></u></h2> (<i>Contrast</i>, but with some remarkable variations) <b>he that loveth not</b> (general, as before: no object: he that hath not love in him) <b>hath never known God</b> (hath not once known: has never had in him even the beginnings of knowledge of God.

But take the proposition, <b>God is love</b>, of God’s essential being,—as a strict definition of God, and the argumentation will be strict: He that loveth not never knew love: God is love [the terms are co-essential and co-extensive]: therefore he who loveth uot never knew God).<h2><u><b>9, 10.</b></u></h2><i> Proof of this</i> as far as we are concerned, in God’s sending His Son to save us. <b>In this</b> (viz. which follows) <b>the love of God was manifested in regard to us</b> (these words, <b>in regard to us</b>, must be taken with the verb, not with the love of God. Many have thus wrongly connected it, and in consequence have been compelled to distort the <b>in regard to</b> into <i>“towards:”</i> so Luther, &c., and the A.V. Connected then with the verb, it must not be taken as equivalent to <i>“towards,”</i> but as “in,” i.e. “in the matter of,” in regard of: see ver. 16 below: the manifestation not being made <i>to us</i> as its spectators, but in our persons and cases, as its “material.” <b>us</b>, i.e. believers in general), <b>that God hath sent</b> (perfect tense. The manifestation is regarded as one act, done implicitly when God sent His Son: but the sending is regarded in its present abiding effects, which have changed all things since it took place) <b>His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Hcm</b> (no words can be plainer than these, and need less explanation to any one acquainted with St. John. The endeavours of the old rationalists, Socinus, Grotius, &e., to escape from the assertion of Christ’s pre-existence, by substituting <b>for into</b><i> the world, “to the world,”</i> for <b>only begotten,</b> <i>“dearly beloved,”</i> &c., may be seen in Düsterdieck. He well remarks, “Such expositors may naturally be expected to give an answer to the ‘question, how a Christ so understood could be our life [ver. 9], our atonement [ver. 10], or our salvation [ver. 14].” <br><br>The two emphatic words in the sentence are<b> only- begotten</b> and <b>live</b>. This was the proof, that SUCH a son of God was sent, that we might LIVE). <h2><u><b>10.</b></u></h2> <i>The same proof particularized</i> in its highest and noblest point, the atonement: and at the same time this brought ont, that the love manifested by it was all on God’s side, none on ours: was love to us when we were enemies, Rom. v. 8, and therefore all the greater. Ch. iii. 16 is very similar: except that there it is Christ’s personal love tous: here the Father’s, in sending His Son. <b>In this is love</b> (‘in this case,” “in this matter,” “herein,” <i>is</i>, ‘<i>is found</i>,’ <i>‘exists</i>,’ Love; in the abstract. ‘This interpretation is necessary, on account of the disjunction which follows. If the word love meant, the love of God just spoken of, then it would be irrelevant to subjoin that this love was not our love to Him but His to us), <b>not that we loved God</b> (the verb refers to an indefinite time past—no act of Jove of ours to God at any time done furnishes this example of love, but an act of His towards us, It is not the <i>nature </i>of our love to God, as contrasted with His to us, of which the clause treats, but the non- existence of the one love as set against the historical manifestation of the other. Again that “ He loved us, though we did not love Him,” is so far in the words as it is given by the context [see above], but is not the meaning of the words themselves), but <b>that He loved us</b> (referring again to an <i>act </i>of Love, which is now specified), and (prove this love in that He) <b>sent His Son</b> <b>a propitiation</b> (see on ch. ii. 2) <b>for</b> (see ibid.) <b>our sins</b> (His death being therein<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mzw7KTA87ppcK6MaZJxzCA8Udv-eoipN/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Strictly parallel with the latter part of ch. iii, 16, where the same ethical inference is drawn with regard to the example of Christ Himself. <b>Beloved</b> (the Apostle’s usual introduction of a fervent and solemn address, vv. 1, 7, al.), <b>if</b> (this <b>if</b> with an indicative, stating a fact, is very difficult to give exactly in English. It is not on the one hand any expression on uncertainty: but neither on the other is it exactly equivalent to <i>“since,”</i> or <i>“seeing that.”</i> We may call it a certainty put in the shape of a doubt, that the hearer’s mind may grasp the certainty for itself, not take it from the speaker. “If [it be true that]...” is perhaps the nearest English filling up of the sense)<b> God so loved us</b> (<i>so</i> namely as detailed in ver. 10, which, and which alone, is pointed at), <b>we also ought to love one another</b> (the <b>also</b> does not belong to the <b>ought</b>, but purely to the <b>we</b>,—“we, on our side.” But on whnt does the obligation, asserted in <b>we ought</b>, rest? Clearly, on that relation to God and one another implied by being children of God, which runs through all this section of the Epistle. If we are of God, that love which is in Him, and which He is, will be in us, will make us like Him, causing us to love those who are begotten of Him, ch, v. 1, 2. And of this love, our apprehension of His Love to us will be the motive and the measure). <h2><u><b>12.</b></u></h2> <b>God hath no one ever beheld</b> (what is the connexion of these words, so suddenly and startlingly introduced? It is evident that ver. 12 is connected with ver. 11, by the words <i>“if we love one another,”</i> taking up again <i>“we ought to love one another.”</i> But it is also evident that it is connected with ver. 13 by the words <i>“abideth in us,”</i> &c. And it is further plain, that these words, <b>God hath no one ever beheld</b>, must have some close reference to <i>loving one</i> <i>another</i>, seeing that they stand between those words in ver. 11, and the resumption of them in ver. 12.<h2><u>Now on examining ver. 11, we find an unexpected substitution, <i>“if God so loved us, we also ought to love</i> (not <i>God</i>, but</u></h2> <b>one another</b>.” Why so? Here, ver. 20 will guide us to an answer, if rightly used. Not, because we <i>cannot </i>love God whom we have not seen: but because the exponents of God, whom we have not seen, are our brethren, whom we do see. And the Apostle, in substituting <i>“one another,”</i> does not for a moment drop or set aside the higher, <i>“God,”</i> but in fact leads up to it, by putting its lower and visible objects before us. And then ver. 12 comes in as an explanation, an apology as it were, for this substitution, in the following manner: <i>Love</i> <b>one another</b>, I say: for the love to God, which is our duty, is love towards one whom we have never seen, and cannot exist in us [as ver. 20] unless by and with its lower degrees as manifested towards our brethren whom we have seen. By our love to them are we to know, how far we have love to Him: if that be present, He dwelleth in us, and <i>“the love of Him is perfected in us.”</i> And thus [see below] the way is prepared for vv. 15, 16, which take up and bring to a conclusion the reasoning): <b>if we love one another, God abideth in us</b> (for the reason already stated in ver. 8, and restated in immediate connexion with this very matter in ver. 16, that God is Love, and every one that loveth is born of God, knows God, abides in God and God in him), <b>and </b>(simply the copula) <b>the love of Him</b> (as in ch. ii. 5, where we had the same expression, our <i>love to Him</i>, not, as some explain it, <i>His love to us</i>. This is evident, not merely from ii. 5, but from the context here: sce it explained above, and remember that it is our love to God which is here the subject, as evinced by our love to our brethren. This is further shewn by the recurrence of the same expression in ver. 17, <i>“Herein is love perfected with us,”</i> and ver. 18, <i>“he that feareth is not made perfect in love.”</i> And so the majority of Commentators) is<br><br><br><br> Vou.

Here, as there, it signifies, has reached its full maturity: the <i>loving one another</i> being the token and measure of it) <b>in us</b> (keep the primary and obvious sense, “<i>in us</i>,” “within us,” as in ch. ii. 5).<h2><u><b>13.</b></u></h2> <b>In this we know that we are abiding in Him and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit </b>(nearly repeated from ch. ii, 24. But why introduced here? In the former verse, the <i>fact </i>of His abiding in us was assured to us, if we love one another. Of this fact, when thus loving, we need a token. Him we cannot see: has He given us any testimony of His presence in us? He has given us such a testimony, in making us partakers of His Holy Spirit. This fact it is to which the Apostle here calls our attention, as proving not the external fact of the sending of the Son [ver. 14], but one within ourselves,— the indwelling of God in us, and our abiding in Him. It is obvious that all inferences from the expression <i>“given us of His Spirit”</i> against the personality of the Holy Ghost are quite beside the purpose: compare Acts ii. 17 with Joel iii. 1. We each dwelling of one and the same personal Spirit, but each according to our measure, 1 Cor. xii. 4, 11. One only had the Spirit without measure, in all His fulness: even Christ; John iii. 34. And the presence of the Holy Spirit is most aptly adduced here where love is in question, His first fruit being love, and His presence being tested by His fruits).<h2><u><b>14, 15, 16.</b></u></h2> The connexion seems to be this: the inward evidence of God's abiding in us and we in Him, is, the gift of His Spirit. But this is not the only evidence nor the only test which we have: This internal evidence is accompanied by, nay, is itself made possible [see ver. 19] by, our recognition of the Father’s love in sending His Son as our Saviour: which last is a fact, testified by human evidence. This recognition of God’s love is a condition of abiding in Him and He in us: in a word, is the <i>abiding in love</i>, which is equivalent to abiding in Him. <b>And we</b> (this <b>we</b>, emphatic, brings up in sharp relief the apostolic body, whom Christ appointed His witnesses, John xv. 27, Acts i. 8 The assertion is of the same kind as that in ch. i. 1) <b>have beheld </b>(with our eyes: the same word, and in the same sense, as in John i. 32) <b>and do testify that the Father hath sent </b>(do testify, not merely to the historical fact as a thing past, but to its abiding influence as implied by the words, <i>“Saviour of the world”</i> below: that the Father sent the Son, and that the Son is the Saviour of the world) <b>the Son</b> (better here than “<i>His</i> Son:” <b>the Father</b> and <b>the Son</b> are here used as theological terms) <b>as Saviour of the world </b>(<b>the world </b>here, as in ch. ii, 2, John iii, 16, in its widest sense: no evasion of this sense, such as the “<i>elect in all nations</i>,” is to be endured). <h2><u><b>15.</b></u></h2> And recognition of this fact is a condition and proof of the life of God. <b>Whosoever confesseth</b> (the same remark holds good of this confessing, as before with regard to denying, ch ii. 28: viz., that we must not bring into it more than the Apostle intends by it: it is not the “confession of the <i>life</i>” which is here spoken of, but that of the lips only. Of course it would be self-evident that, this is taken by the Apostle as ruling the life; but simply <i>as</i> a matter of course, Me speaks of the ideal realized) <b>that Jesus is the Son of God</b> (i.e. receives the testimony in the last verse as true), <b>God abideth in him, and he in God.</b> <h2><u><b>16.</b></u></h2> a) <b>And we</b> (not now the apostolic body only, but communicative; the Apostle and his readers.

See John vi. 69) <b>the love which God hath in regard to us</b> (literally <b>in us</b>, <i>in our case</i>, as above, ver. 9: not “towards us,” as Beza [and A. V.}, Luther, &c.), b) <b>God is Love, and he that abideth in love abideth in God and God </b>[<b>abideth</b>] <b>in him </b>(this is the solemn and formal restatement of that which has been the ground-tone of the whole since ver. 7. And here, as there, <i>Tove</i> is in its widest abstract sense. Its two principal manifestations are, love to God, and love to one another: but this saying is of Love absolute).<h2><u><b>17, 18.</b></u></h2> These verses, which are parallel with ch. iii. 19–21, set forth the confidence with which perfect love shall endow the believer in the great day of judgment. <b>Herein love perfected with us</b> (for the meaning of <b>herein</b>, see below. <b>Love</b>, not, as Luther and others, <i>God's love to us</i>: this is forbidden by the whole context: our verse is introduced by <i>“he that abideth in love,”</i> and continued by <i>“there is no fear in love:”</i> it is love dwelling and advancing to perfection in us. And again, not love to God merely, nor love to our brethren merely; these are concrete manifestations of it: but love itself in the abstract—the principle of love, as throughout this passage. This sense of <i>love</i> will point out that of <b>with us</b>, which belongs not to the word <i>love</i>, but to the verb, as in ver. 12. Love is considered as planted in us; its degrees of increase take place <b>with us</b>—not merely “<i>chez nous</i>,” <i>in us</i>, but as <i>concerned with us</i>; in a sense somewhat similar to that in “<i>magnified His mercy</i><b> with her</b>,” Luke i, 58. See 2 John 2, where however the idea of <i>dwelling with</i> is more brought out than here), <b>that we have confidence in the day of judgment</b> (that gives not the purpose of the <i>perfecting of love</i>, but the explanation of “<i>herein</i>:” “in this love is perfected in us, viz, that we, &c.” The confidence which we shall have in that day, and which we have even now by anticipation of that day, is the perfection of our love; grounded on the consideration [<i>because even as He is, &c.</i>] which follows: casting out fear, which cannot consist with perfect love, ver. 18): <b>because even as He</b> (Christ, see below) <b>is, we also are in this world</b> (this is the reason or ground of our confidence : that we, as we now are in the world, are like Christ: and in the background lies the thought, He will not, in that day, condemn those who are like Himself. In these words, the sense must be gained by keeping strictly to the tenses and grammatical construction: not “<i>as He</i><b> was</b> in the world,” as some, changing the tense. And when we have adhered to tense and grammar, wherein is the likeness spoken of to be found? Clearly, by what has been above said, not in our trials and persecutions. Nor by our being not of the world as He is not of the world: nor in that we, as sons of adoption through Him, are beloved of God, even as He is beloved: nor, in that we live in Love, as He lives in Love: but in that we are <i>righteous as He</i> <i>is righteous</i>, ch. ii. 29, iii. 3 ff., 10, 22: this being evinced by our abiding in Love. St. John does not’ say that Love is perfected in confidence in us, because we resemble Christ in Love; but he refers to the fundamental truth on which our Love itself rests, and says; because we are absolutely like Christ, because we are in Christ Himself, because He lives in us, for withont this there cannot be likeness to Him; in a word, because we are, in that communion with Christ which we are assured of by our<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nNVeTZY014eObvQY3Pjt2N0_RcklkDh0/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Essentially, the reason here rendered for our confidence in the day of judgment is the same as that given ch. iii. 21 f. for another kind of confidence, viz., that we keep His commandments. This also betokens the righteousness of which Christ is the essential exemplar, and which is a necessary attribute of those who through Christ are children of God),<h2><u><b>18.</b></u></h2> Confidence in (or as understood, as to) that terrible day presupposes the absence of fear: and this casting out of fear is the very work of love, which in its perfect state cannot coexist with fear.— <b>Fear</b> (abstract and general) <b>existeth not in love</b> (abstract and general also, as in ver. 17: not <i>“God’s lore to us;”</i> nor <i>“brotherly love”</i>), <b>nay perfect</b> (see on ver. 17) <b>love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment</b> (see below): <b>but he that feareth hath not been perfected in </b>[<b>his</b>]<b> love.</b> The points here to be noticed are, <br><br>1) the emphatic <b>existeth not</b>, which is better rendered as above, than “there is no fear in love,” in order to keep <b>fear</b>, which is the subject in the Greek, also the subject in. the English: <br><br>2) <b>nay</b>, or <i>“but:”</i> which is not here the mere adversative after a negative clause, in which case it would refer to something in which fear <i>is</i>, e.g. “<i>fear existeth not in love, but existeth in hatred:</i>” but it is the stronger adversative, implying “nay far otherwise:” so far from it, that... <br><br>3) the argument, which is, <i>a</i>) that nothing having torment can consist with perfect love: <i>b</i>) that, fear is in us by nature, and needs <i>casting out</i> in order to its absence. <br><br>4) the meaning of hath torment. Does <i>torment</i> mean <i>merely </i>pain, or pain as the result of <i>punishment</i>? This last is certainly the sense, both from the usage of the word, and from the context, in which the day of judgment is before us. Fear, by anticipating punishment, has it even now; bears about a foretaste of it and so partakes of it.<br><br>5) the last clause, “<i>he that feareth is not made perfect in love,</i>” is intimately connected with what follows [see on ver. 14] as well as with what went before. The <b>and</b> [in the original, <b>but</b>: see rendering above] is adversative to the whole preceding sentence, and mainly to the idea of perfect love therein expressed. <br><br>As regards the absence of fear from the love of the Christian believer, it has been well observed by Œumenius, that there are two kinds of godly fear, one which afflicts men with a sense of their evil deeds and dread of God’s anger, and which is not abiding: and the other, of which it is said, “The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever,” Ps. xix. and which is free from this kind of terror. And Bengel says in his brief pointed manner, “The condition of men is various: without fear and love alike: with fear and without love: with fear and love: without fear and with love.”<h2><u><b>19.</b></u></h2> I am sorry to be obliged here to differ from the best modern Commentators, and some of the older ones, in holding firmly that <b>we love</b>, indicative, is right, and not “<i>let us love,</i>” imperative [either of which would satisfy the original word]. This I do not merely on account of the expressed and emphatic <b>we</b>, though that would be a strong point in the absence of a stronger, but on account of the context, which appears to me to be broken by the imperative. He that feareth is not perfect in love. Our love [abstract, not specified whether to God or our brother] is brought about by, conditioned by, depends upon, His love to us first; it is only a sense off that which can bring about our love: and if so, then from the very nature of things it is void of terror, and full of confidence, as springing out of a sense of His love to us. Nor only so: our being new begotten in love is not only the effect of <i>a sense of</i> His past love, but is the effect of that love itself: <b>We</b> (emphatic—one side of the antithesis) <b>love</b> (most Commentators supply “<i>Him</i>” or “<i>one another</i>,” but unnecessarily. It is of all love that he is speaking; of love in its root and ideal), <b>because He </b>(God: see the parallel, ver. 10) <b>first loved us</b> (viz. in the sending of His Son).<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MEVBuAoqgmu1EanHHgwqn_CkVdWP75iF/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This <i>love</i> is sal, necessarily manifested in <i>both</i> of great departments of its exercise. Love, living and working in the heart as a principle, will fix first upon objects at hand and seen: those objects being natural objects for it to fix on, How then can a man love God, the highest object of love, who is removed from his sight, and at the ame time refuse to love his brother, bearing the mark of a child of God, before his eyes from day to day? Put in a brief form, the argument, as connected with the last verse, is this: His love has begotten <i>us </i>anew in love: in this <i>us</i> are included our brethren, objects of our daily sight: if therefore we do not love them, we do not love Him. <b>If any say</b> (“have said;” i.e. at any time: the saying once, rather than the habit, is the hypothesis), <b>I love God, and hate</b> (present tense, of habit) <b>his brother,</b> <b>he is a liar: for</b> (here again the argument needs supplying from our common sense, which tells us that sight is an incentive towards love) <b>he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen</b> (perfect tense, implying,—and continues to feel the influence of that sight. We do not say “<b>I</b> have seen him” of the dead, but of the living only), <b>cannot love God whom he hath not seen</b> (At. John does not say that there is no love without sight; nor that we love all we see better than any thing we do not see: his argument rests on a deeper and truer position: viz, on that assumed in the term <b>his brother</b>, which carries with it the consideration that he of whom it is said is begotten of God. Both terms, <b>his brother</b>, and <b>God</b>, are used within the limits of the Christian life, of which that is true, which is unfolded ch. v. 1, that this <i>brother</i>, as begotten of God, is a necessary object of love to one that loves Him that begat him. <i>Here</i>, a lower step of the same argument is taken ; but without this eat truth, lying beneath the word <i>brother</i>, it wonld carry no conviction with it).<h2><u><b>21.</b></u></h2> And besides this argument from common sense, there is another most powerful one, which the Apostle here adds: “How lovest thou Him, whose commandment thou hatest?” as Augustine says. <b>And this commandment we have from Him</b> (God: not, Christ: see below), <b>that he who loveth God, love also his brother</b> (where have we this commandment? In the great summary of the law, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ... and thy neighbour as thyself so often cited by our Lord: see Matt. xxii. 37—39),<h1><u><b>CHAP. V. 1.</b></u></h1> And who is our brother? and why does this name carry with it such an obligation to love? These questions, in closest connexion with the last verse, the Apostle answers in this, <b>Every one that believeth that Jesus is the Christ hath been begotten of God</b> (to whom do these words apply? from what follows, in the verb <b>hath been</b> [or, <b>is</b>] <b>begotten</b> is taken up by <b>him that is begotten</b>, to the brother whom we are to love as a necessary accompaniment of our loving God. But most Commentators assume that it is of <i>ourselves</i> that this is said: <i>our </i>birth of God depends on and is in closest union with our faith, ch. iii. 23. Then the connexion between this and the following clause must be made by filling up an ellipsis, “and if begotten of God we love God.” But this is far-fetched ; and, as has been above shewn implicitly, alien from the context, the object of which is to point out who those are whom we are bound to love, if we love God.

As Calvin says, “Under this singular number he designates all the faithful. It is an argument drawn from the common order of nature”).<h2><u><b>2.</b></u></h2> And indeed so inseparable are the two, that. as before, iv. 20, our love to our brethren was made a sign and necessary condition of our love to God, so conversely, our love to God, ascertained hy our keeping His commandments, is itself the measure of our love to the children of God, Either of the two being found to be present, the presence of the other follows. <b>In this we know that we love the children of God </b>(this, <b>the children of God</b>, takes up again, <i>“him that is begotten of him”</i> of the preceding verse), <b>when</b> (indefinite; “in every case where”) <b>we love God, and do His commandments</b> (this adjunct is made, as the following verse shews, in order to introduce an equivalent to <i>loving God</i>, by which its presence may be judged). <h2><u><b>3.</b></u></h2> <b>For</b> (explaining the connexion of the two preceding clauses) <b>the love of God is this</b> (consists in this), <b>that</b> (explanatory: what he means by this) <b>we keep His commandments.

Almost all the Commentators refer to Matt. xi. 86, “<i>My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i>” This declaration, that His commandments are not grievous, has, as did ch. iii. 9, furnished some of the Roman-Catholic Commentators with an opportunity of characterizing very severely the Protestant position, that none can keep God’s commandments. But here, as there, the reply is obvious and easy. The course of the Apostle’s argument here, as introduced in the next verse by <b>because</b>, substantiates this fact, that His commandments are not grievous, by shewing that all who are born of God are standing in and upon the victory which their faith has obtained over the world. In this victorious state, and in as far as they have advanced into it, in other words in proportion as the divine life is developed and dominant in them, do they find those commandments not grievous. If this state, in its ideality, were realized in them, there would be no difficulty for them in God’s commandments: it is because, and in so far as, sin is still reigning in their mortal bodies, and their wills are unsubdued to God’s will, that any grievousness, any burden, remains in keeping those commandments),<h2><u><b>4.</b></u></h2> <b>because</b> (reason, why His command- ments are not grievons) <b>all that is begotten of God </b>(the neuter is here used as gathering together in one, under the category of “begotten of God,” the “<i>we</i>” implied in the last verses) <b>conquereth</b> (of habit: simply predicated of the category, <i>“all that is born of God”</i>) <b>the world</b> (the kingdom of evil under its prince the devil, God’s adversary.

And this is further expressed by the past tense here; by which it is signified that the victory is already won: see ch. ii. 13, iv. 4). <h2><u><b>5.</b></u></h2> If it be asked, How does our faith overcome the world? this verse furnishes the answer; because it brings us into union with Jesus Christ the Son of God, making us as He is, and partakers of His victory, John xvi. 33, Through this belief we are born again as sons of God; we have Him in us, One greater than he who is in the world, ch. iv. 4. And this conclusion is put in the form of a triumphant question: What other person can do it? Who that believes this, can fail to do it? <b>Who is he that conquereth the world, except he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</b> By comparing ver. 1 a, we find 1) that <i>“the Christ”</i> there answers to <i>“the Son of God”</i> here; 2) that by the combination, of the two verses, we get the proposition of ver. 4a.<h2><u><b>6—21.</b></u></h2> THE THIRD AND LAST DIVISION OF THE EPISTLE. This portion falls naturally into two parts: vv.6–13, and vv. 14–21: the former of which treats of the concluding part of the argument, and the latter forms the close of the Epistle.<h2><u><b>6–13.</b></u></h2> As in the former portions, our communion with God who is light [i. 5 ff.] was treated, and our birth in righteousness from God who is righteous [ii. 29 ff.], by faith in Jesus the Son of God,—so now we have another most important element of the Christian life set before us: the testimony to it arising from that life itself: <i>the witness of the spiritual life to its own reality.</i> This witness rests not on apostolic testimony alone, but on the Holy Spirit, which the believer has in himself [ver. 10], and which is God’s testimony respecting His Son [vv. 9, 10], and our assurance that we have eternal life [ver. 13].<br><br>There is hardly a passage in the New Test. which has given rise to more variety of interpretation: certainly none which [on account of the apparent importance of the words interpolated after ver. 7] has been the field of so much critical controversy. Complete accounts of both the exposit and the criticism will be found in the recent monographs on the Epistle: more especially in that of Düsterdieck.<h2><u><b>6.</b></u></h2> <b>This</b> (viz. the Person spoken of in the last verse; Jesus. This, which is maintained by most Commentators, is denied by Knapp and Huther, who refer this to <i>“the Son of God:”</i> “The Son of God is he, &c.:” making the proposition assert, the identity of the Son of God with the historical Jesus, not the converse. ‘This Huther supports on two grounds: 1) that the fact that Jesus came by water and blood needed no proof even to Heretics: 2) that on the ordinary interpretation the following words, <i>“Jesus Christ,”</i> become altogether superfluous. But to these it is easily replied, 1) that although the fact might be confessed, that was not confessed to which the fact bore testimony, viz. that Jesus who came in the flesh was the Son of God: 2) that the appositional clause, <i>“Jesus Christ,”</i> is by no means superfluous, being only a solemn reassertion of our Lord’s Person and Office as testified by these signs. The main objection to Huther’s view is, that, as well stated by Düsterdieck, it makes the coming by water and blood, which, by the context, is evidently in the Apostle’s argument, a substantiating consideration, to be merely an exceptional one: “this Son of God is Jesus the Christ, <i>though</i> He came by water and blood.” Therefore the other interpretation must stand fast) <b>is he that came by water and blood </b>(<b>came</b> refers not to the Lord’s birth in the flesh, but to His open manifestation of himself before the world.

Two canons of interpretation have been laid down by Düsterdieck, and may safely be adopted: 1) “Water” and “blood” must point both to some purely historical facts in the life of our Lord on earth, and to some still present witnesses for Christ: and 2) they must not he interpreted symbolically, but understood of something so real and powerful, as that by them God’s testimony is given to believers, and eternal life assured to them. These canons at once exclude all figurative interpretations, such as that of Socinus und his school, in which <i>water </i>stands for the purity and innocence of the life and doctrine of Christ, Heb. x. 22, Eph. v. 26, —and <i>blood</i> for the death of Christ as His testimony of Himself.<br><br>Düsterdieck observes that it is remarkable that the best Roman-Catholic expositor, Estius [whose commentary is unfortunately broken off at this verse], does not, as some have done, interpret <b>blood </b>of the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, but puts together <i>water</i> and <i>blood</i>, as Calvin and Luther. So that, as Düsterdieck proceeds to say, the great leaders of the three schools of theology have had the tact to see that which their less skilled followers have missed seeing,—that <i>blood</i> cannot by any means be understood of the Lord’s Supper, as has been done by many.<br><br>The next point which comes before us is to enquire whether at. all, or how far, our passage is connected with John xix.34? It occurs here, because many Commentators have seen in the incident there related a miraculous symbolizing of the two sacraments, and in this passage an allusion to that incident. To deny all such allusion seems against probability. The Apostle could hardly both here and in that place lay such evident stress on the water and blood together, without having in his mind some link connecting this place and that. The idea that we have here nothing more than a reference to the fact of John xix. 34, is against our 2nd canon above: but that John xix. 34 and this refer to the same fundamental truth, is I conceive hardly to be doubted.<br><br>It rests now then that we enquire into the meaning of each expression. On the first, <b>blood</b>, there cannot surely be much uncertainty. The blood of His Cross must, by all Scripture analogy, be that intended. The pouring out of this blood was the completion of the baptism which He had to be baptized with, Mark x. 28, 29, Luke xii. 50. And if this is so, to what can the term <b>water</b> be referred so simply, as to that baptism with water, which inaugurated the Lord’s ministry? It might indeed be said, that the baptism which He instituted for His followers, better satisfies the test of our 2nd canon, that viz. of being an abiding testimony in the Christian Church. But to this there lies the objection, that as <i>blood</i> signifies something which happened to Christ Himself, so must <i>water</i> likewise, at least primarily, whatever permanent testimony such event may have left in the Christian Church. And thus some modern Commentators have taken it; as uniting the historical fact of the Lord’s baptism with the ordinance of baptism, grounded on it, and abiding in the Christian Church. Düsterdieck refuses to accept this view, denying that our Lord’s baptism was any proof or testimony of His Messiahship, aud understanding water of the ordinance of baptism only. But surely we are not right in interpreting the words “<i>He that came by water,</i>” <i>He that ordained baptism:</i> nor in giving the two,<i> blood </i>and <i>water</i>, an entirely different reference. For his endeavour to escape from this by making the former represent not Christ’s death but His blood, applied to us, cannot be accepted, as giving a “non-natural” sense to the words <i>“he that came by blood”</i> likewise.<br><br>All this being considered, it seems impossible to avoid giving both to <i>blood </i>and <i>water </i>the combined senses above indicated, and believing that such were before the Apostle’s mind. They represent,—the <b>water</b>, the baptism of water which the Lord Himself underwent and instituted for His followers,—the <b>blood</b>, the baptism of blood which He Himself underwent, and instituted for His followers. And it is equally impossible to sever from these words the historical accompaniments and associations which arise on their mention.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q2dObTAxzpq-9DCnQWw4GUX_Os62HDWP/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And thus both our canons are satisfied, which certainly is not the case in Düsterdieck’s interpretation, though they were laid down by himself), <b>Jesus Christ </b>(see above on <b>this</b>, In all the places where St. John uses this Name, it las a solemn meaning, and is by the emphasis thus thrown on the official designation of our Lord, nearly equivalent to “<i>Jesus the Christ.</i>” Compare John i. 17, xvii. 3: 1 John i. 3, 7, ii. 1, iii. 23, iv. 2, v. 20: 2 John 3, 7): <b>not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood</b> (<b>in</b>, see above on <b>by</b>. The sense of the two is there shewn to be closely allied, in giving rather the “element in which,” <b>by</b>, the medium through which. The definite article before each word shews that they are well-known and solemn ideas. It is inserted not as matter of course, but as giving solemnity.<br><br>But why has the Apostle added this sentence? It has been thought that it is to give Christ the preference over Moses, who came only by water (1 Cor. x. 2), and Aaron, who came only by blood (of sacrifice), whereas Christ united both. But this is too far-fetched. Another opinion again regards the words as directed against those who despised the Cross of Christ (1 Cor. i. 23): but a more definite explanation than this is required. And those can hardly be wrong, who find it in such words as those of the Baptist in John i. 25, <i>“I baptize with (in) water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not:”</i> compare the emphatic repetitions below, ver. 31, <i>“I came baptizing with (in) water;”</i> and ver. 38, <i>“He that sent me to baptize with (in) water.”</i> The baptism of Jesus was not one of water only, but one of blood,—<i>“behold the Lamb of God”</i>—and something more than that which follows in the next clause): <b>and the Spirit is that which witnesseth, because the Spirit is the truth</b> (that is, as explained by the next verse, the Spirit is an additional witness, besides those already mentioned to the Messiahship of Jesus, and in that, to the eternal life which God has given us in Him. Some have thought that <b>because </b>should be “that:” the same Greek word signifying hoth these. But it is not to the fact that the Spirit is the truth, that the Spirit gives witness: but it is the fact that He is the truth, which makes Him so weighty a witness; which makes the giving of witness so especially His office.<br><br>Very various however have been the meanings here given to <b>the Spirit</b>. One view understands, the spirit of our Lord, which He when dying commended into His Father’s hands, Another, explaining <i>water and blood </i>of the two Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, sees in <b>the Spirit</b>, in connexion with John xx. 22 ff., a third Sacrament of <i>absolution</i>, Others regard it as equivalent to <i>the spiritual man</i>, i.e. St. John himself. Others again regard it as equivalent to God—and the occasion of the testimony to be the Resurrection, when our Lord rose with Divine power. The Socinian Commentators interpret it of the divine power by which Christ wrought His miracles. But this, as well as Bede’s interpretation, that the Spirit which descended on the Lord at His baptism is meant, inasmuch as it testified to His being the true Son of God, fails, in giving no <i>present abiding</i> testimony such as the context requires. Others again understand by it the ministry of the word.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_EjdK5p_DmoueaLGAosIMiPwnARq1L2U/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But nothing ean be plainer than that we must not alter the meaning, where the word <b>for</b> binds together the sentences so closely.<br><br>The above interpretations failing to give any satisfactory account of the text, we recur to the simple and obvious meaning, <i>the Holy Spirit</i>. And it seems fully to satisfy all the requirements of the passage. The Holy Spirit is He, who testifies of Christ [John xv. 26], who glorifies Him, and shews of the things which belong to Him [John xvi. 14]. It is by the possession of Him that we know that we have Christ [ch. iii, 24], And the following clause, “because the Spirit is the Truth,” exactly agrees with this. He is the absolute truth [John xiv. 17, xv. 26], leading into all the truth [John xvi. 13 f.]. And in this consists the all-importance and the infallibility of His witness). <h2><u><b>7.</b></u></h2> “John here renders a reason why he spoke not of the Spirit only, who has the chief authority in this matter, but also of the water and the blood, because in them also there is no small credit due to testimony, and the ternary number is in case of witnesses the most complete.” Grotius. <b>For</b> (that this, and not “<i>because</i>,” is the correct English reading, see my Greek Test.) <b>those who bear witness are three</b> (the three are considered as living and speaking witnesses; hence we have the masculine form in the original. By being <i>three</i>, they fulfil the requirements of the Law as to full testimony: Deut. xvii. 6, xix. 15: Matt. xviii. 16, 2 Cor. xiii, 1), <b>the Spirit, and the water, and the blood</b> (now, the Spirit is put first: and not without reason. The Spirit is, of the three, the only living and active witness, properly speaking: besides, the water and the blood are no witnesses without Him, whereas He is independent of them, testifying both in the und out of them), <b>and the three concur in one</b> (contribute to one and the same result: viz. the truth that Jesus is the Christ, and that we have life in Him. And this their one testimony is given by the purification in the water of baptism into His name, John iii. 5: by the continual cleansing from all sin which we enjoy in and by His atoning blood: by the inward witness of His Spirit, which He hath given us).<br><br>The question of the genuineness of the words read in the received text at the end of ver. 7 is discussed, as far as external grounds are concerned, in the Digest in my Greek Test.; and it may there be seen, that unless pure caprice is to be followed in the criticism of the sacred text, <i>there is not the shadow of a reason for supposing them genuine</i>. Even the supposed citations of them in early Latin Fathers have now, on closer examination, disappeared.—Something remains to be said on internal grounds, on which we have full right to enter, now that the other is secured. And on these grounds it must appear, on any fair and unprejudiced consideration, that the words are 1) alien from the context: 2) in themselves incoherent, and betraying another hand than the Apostle’s. For 1) the context, as above explained, is employed in setting forth the reality of the substance of the faith which overcomes the world. even of our eternal life in Jesus the Son of God. And this is shewn by a threefold testimony, subsisting in the revelation of the Lord Himself, and subsisting in us His people. And this testimony is the water of baptism, the blood of atonement, the Spirit of truth, concurrent in their witness to the one fact that He is the Son of God, and that we have eternal life in Him. Now <i>between two steps</i> of this argument,—not as a mere analogy referred to at its conclusion,—insert the words “for there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one,” and who can fail to see, unless prejudice have blinded his eyes, that the context is disturbed by the introduction of an irrelevant matter? Consequently, Bengel, one of the most strennous upholders of the words, is obliged tamely to take refuge in the transposition of vv. 7 and 8 (which was perhaps the original form of its insertion in the vulgate), so as to bring into treatment the matter in hand, before the illustration of it is introduced. But even suppose this could be done; what kind of illustration is it? What is it to which our attention is directed?

Is this triplicity a fact worthy of such a comparison? And then, what is the testimony in heaven? Is it borne to men? Certainly not: for God hath no man seen, as He is there: His only-begotten Son hath declared Hiin to us on earth, where all testimony affecting us must be borne. Is it a testimony to angels? Possibly: but what has this to do with the matter in hand? And then, again, what but an unworthy play on words can it be called, to adduce the fact of <b>oneness</b> on the one side, the essential unity of the ever blessed Godhead, and on the other the concurrence in testifying to one fact,—as correspondent, to one another? Does not this betray itself as the fancy of a patristic gloss, in the days when such analogies and comparisons were the sport of every theological writer? And 2) the very’ words betray themselves. <i>“The Father”</i> and <i>“the Word”</i> are never combined by St. John, but always <i>the Father</i> and <i>the Son</i>. The very apology of Bengel, “the appellative, <i>the Word</i>, is most appropriate to <i>testimony</i>,” may serve to shew how utterly weak he must have felt the cause to be.<br><br>The best conclusion to the whole subject is found in the remark of Bengel himself on another occasion of the practice reprobated, of which he himself furnishes here so striking an instance: “They exhibit a mischievous zeal in the Lord’s quarrels, who bring themselves to reason thus, ‘This text is convenient for my doctrine and argument; therefore I will constrain myself to believe it genuine, and will obstinately defend it, and all that can be scraped together on its behalf.’ But the Truth needs not false supports, resting much better on itself alone.” As the results of critical enquiry now stand, we may safely affirm, that no reasonable man, acquainted with the facts, can again defend, the genuineness of these words. If any do defend them, it is the charitable conclusion that he speaks in ignorance. The real mischief is, that the ignorant in high places allow themselves to use the strong language of authority, and thus become the chief enemies of truth. A sketch of the principal particulars of the dispute and of the books relating to it is given in Horne’s Introduction, vol. iv. pp. 355–388.<h2><u><b>9.</b></u></h2> An argument <i>from the less to the greater</i>, grounded on the practice of mankind, by which it is shewn that God’s testimony must be by all means believed by us.<b> If we </b>(mankind in general; all reasonable men) <b>receive </b>(as we <i>do</i>: receive with approval; <i>accept</i>) <b>the testimony of men </b>(generic; <b>the </b>testimony, i.e. in any given ease. No special testimony need be thought of, as touching this present case: the proposition is general), <b>the testimony of God is greater </b>(supply in the argument, “and therefore much more ought we to receive that.” The testimony of God here spoken of is not any particular testimony, as the prophecies concerning Christ, or the testimony of the Baptist and other eye-witnesses to Him, or the Prophets, the Baptist, Martyrs, and Apostles: it is general, as is the testimony of men with which it is compared. The particular testimony pointed at by the general proposition is introduced in the following words): <b>for</b> (see above at the beginning of ver. 7. Here there is an ellipsis: “and this maxim applies in the case before us, because”) <b>the testimony of God is this, that He hath borne testimony concerning His Son</b> (i.e. the testimony of God to which the argument applies is this, the fact. that He hath borne testimony to His Son).<h2><u><b>10–12.</b></u></h2> The perfect tense, <i>“hath Borne witness,”</i> in ver. 9, shewed that the testimony spoken of is not merely an historical one, such for instance as Matt. iii.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qFDGpciWt7_FbdmirmWoubc0JbbRvSNy/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And these verses explain to us what that testimony is. <b>He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony </b>(just spoken of; the testimony <i>of God</i>) <b>in him</b> (i.e. in himself. The two readings do not differ in sense. The object of the divine testimony being, to produce faith in Christ, the Apostle takes him in whom it has wrought this its effect, one who habitually believes in the Son of God, and says of such an one that he possesses the testimony in himself. What it is, he does not plainly say till below, ver. 11. But easily enough here we can synthetically put together and conjecture of what testimony it is that he is speaking: the Spirit by whom we are born again to eternal Life, the water of baptism by which the new birth is brought to pass in us by the power of the Holy Ghost [John iii. 5, Titus iii. 5], the Blood of Jesus by which we have reconciliation with God, and purification from our sins [ch. i. 7, ii. 2], and eternal life [John vi. 53 ff.],—these three all contribute to and make up our faith in Christ, and so compose that testimony, which the Apostle designates in ver. 11 by the shorter term which comprehends them all): <b>he that believeth not God</b> (St. John, as so frequently, proceeds to put his proposition in the strongest light by bringing out the opposite to it. The <i>believing</i> simply is wholly different from “<i>believing on</i>” above. That is the resting trust of faith: this the mere first step of giving credit to a witness. And thus it is tacitly assumed that one who does not believe in the Son of God, gives no credit to God Himself) <b>hath made Him a liar</b> (perfect tense, because the state of discredit implies a definite rejection still continuing. On the expression, see ch. i, 10),<b> because he</b> <b>hath not believed in</b> (here, not only, hath not credited, though that was the more shameful rejection of God’s word : but now the <i>full </i>rejection—the refusal to <i>believe in</i>, cast himself on God’s testimony) <b>the testimony which God hath testified concerning His Son.</b><h2><u><b>11.</b></u></h2> <i>Wherein this testimony consists.</i> <b>And the testimony</b> (just spoken of) <b>is this, that</b> (consists in this, namely, that ....) <b>God gave</b> (not, as A. V., “<i>hath given.</i>” This is of especial importance here, where not the endurance of a state, but the fact of the gift having been once made, is brought out. The present assurance of our possessing this gift follows in the next clause, and in ver. 12) <b>to us</b> (not <i>decreed</i>, or <i>promised</i>, but gave, absolutely) <b>eternal life, and</b> (this clause does not depend on “<i>this is the witness, that...,”</i> but <i>ranges with</i> that clause: “<i>this is the</i> <i>witness, &c.; and this life is, &c.</i>”) <b>this life is in His Son</b> (is in Him essentially [John i. 4, xi. 25, xiv. 6], bodily [Col. ii. 9], energetically [2 Tim. i. 10]. Here again, as ever in this Epistle, we have to guard against the evasive and rationalistic interpretations of the Socinians, that “the reason of our getting eternal life from God is found in Jesus Himself” [so Socinus]: that in is put for <i>“by,”</i> and is for “<i>happens</i>” [so Grotius]).<h2><u><b>12.</b></u></h2> <i>Conclusion of the whole argument</i> from ver. 6: dependent on the lust clause of ver. 11, and carrying it on a step further, even to the absolute identity as matter of possession for the believer, of the Son of God, and eternal life. <b>He that hath the Son, hath the life: he that hath not the Son of God, the life hath he not.</b> First notice the diction and arrangement, on which Bengel has well remarked, “The verse has two members: in the former ‘<i>of</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AC_ZFYob11qXiWUyn_-FgSgDHyPQn0Qr/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This view is far more probable, than that it should refer only to what has occurred since ver. 6, as ch. ii. 26 to ver. 18 ff. there: or only to vv. 11, 12. Still less likely is it that the concluding portion of the Epistle <i>begins </i>with this verse, as some lve thought. <b>These things wrote I to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life,</b> [<b>to you</b>] <b>that believe in the name of the Son of God </b>(the two readings come, in the sense, to much the sane. If that in the A. V. be followed, then the words <i>“that ye may believe”</i> must be interpreted “that ye may continue to believe”).<h2><u><b>14—21.</b></u></h2> CLOSE OF THE EPISTLE. The link which binds this passage to ver. 13 is the word <b>confidence</b>, taken up again from the <i>knowledge</i> spoken of in that verse, This <i>confidence </i>is the very energizing of our spiritual life: and its most notable and ordinary exercise is in communion with God in prayer, for ourselves or for our brethren, vv. 14–17. Then vv. 18–20 continue the explanation of the “sin unto death” and the “sin not unto death,” by setting forth the state of believers as contrasted with that of the world, and the truth of our eternal life as consisting in this, Then with a pregnant caution, ver. 21, the Apostle closes his Epistle.<h2><u><b>14, 15.</b></u></h2> <i>The believer's confidence as shewn in prayer.</i><b> And the confidence which we have towards Him</b> (which follows as a matter of immediate inference from the fact of our spiritual life: see ch. iii. 19–21) <b>is this, that if we ask any thing according to His will, He heareth us</b> (this confidence may be shewn in varions ways, including prayer as one, ch. iii. 22. And that one, of prayer, is alone chosen to be insisted on here. <br><br><b>Him </b>and <b>His will</b> must by all analogy be referred to the Father, not to the Son, by whom we have access to the Father. See especially ch. ii, 21, 22. <br><br>The truth that God hears all our prayers, has been explained on ch. iii, 22. The condition here attached, that the request be <b>according to His will</b>, is in fact limitation within the reality of the Christian life, i.e. in St. John’s way of speaking according to the true ideal. For God’s will is that to which our glorious Head himself submitted himself, and which rules the whole course of the Christian life for our good and His glory: and he who in prayer or otherwise tends against God’s will is thereby, and in so far, transgressing the bounds of his life in God: see James iv. 3. By the continual feeling of submission to His will, joined with continual increase in knowledge of that will, our prayers will be both chastened, and directed aright. If we knew His will thorough! and submitted to it heartily, it would be impossible for us to ask any thing, for the spirit or for the body, which He should not hear and perform. And it is this ideal state, as always, which the Apostle has in<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpHvxTJbFEf5A4esUMRik75LTGJfkrNd/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In this view he goes still further in the next verse).<h2><u><b>15.</b></u></h2> <b>And if we know that He heareth us whatsoever we ask </b>(i.e. our every petition: the condition is omitted this time, as being supposed to be fulfilled), <b>we know that we have the petitions </b>(i.e. the things which form the subject of the petitions) <b>which we have asked from Him</b> (notice the present, <b>we have</b>, combined with the perfect, <b>we have asked.</b> The perfect reaches through all our past prayers to this moment. All these we <b>have</b>: not one of them is lost: He has heard, He has answered them all: we know that we have them in the truest sense, in possession).<h2><u><b>16, 17.</b></u></h2> Join together the confidence concerning prayer just expressed, and the all-essential Christian principle of brotherly love, and we have following as matter of course, the duty, and the practice, of intercession for an erring brother. And of this, with a certain not strictly defined limitation, these verses treat. <b>If any man see </b>(on any occasion: <i>“shall have seen”</i>) <b>his brother</b> (as throughout the Epistle, to be taken in the stricter sense: not any neighbour, but his Christian brother, one born of Ged as he is himself) <b>sinning</b> (this present participle is net merely predicative, but graphic, as describing the ‘brother’ actually in the act and under the bondage of the sin in question) <b>a sin not unto death</b> (see below), <b>he shall ask</b> (the future conveys not merely a permission to ask, “it shall be lawful for him to ask,”— but a command, taking for granted the thing enjoined as that which is to happen), <b>and shall give him life</b> (viz. the <i>asker</i> shall give: not, as many have understood it, <i>God </i>shall give him life, though of course this is so in reality: but the words mean, he, interceding for his brother, shall be the means of bestowing life on him. This bestowal of life by intercessory prayer, is not to be minutely enquired into, whether it is to be accompanied with fraternal rebuke,—whether it consists in the giving to the sinner a repentant heart, but taken as put by the Apostle, in all its simplicity and breadth. <i>Life</i>, viz. the restoration of that divine life from which by any act of sin he was indeed in peril and indeed in process of falling, but his sin was not an actual fall) <b>for them that sin not unto death</b> (the clause takes up and emphatically repeats the hypothesis before made, viz., that the sin of the brother is not unto death. It does so in the plural, because the <b>him </b>before being indefinite, all such cases are now collected in a class: “shall give this life, I repeat, to those who sin not unto death”). <b>There is a sin unto death: concerning it I do not say that he should make request</b> (leaving for the present the great question, I will touch the minor points in this verse. First, it necessarily by the conditions of the context involves what is equivalent to a prohibition. This has been denied by many Commentators. “Ask if thou wilt, but in uncertainty of obtaining,” says Cornelius-a-lapide. And it is equally denied, without the same implied meaning being given, by many others: some of these, as Neander, thinking it implied, that prayer may be made, though the obtaining of it will be difficult,—others, as De Wette, that it will be in vain, others, as Huther, that St.John simply says such a case was not within his view in making the above command. And most of even these who have recognized the prohibition, strive to soften it, saying, as e.g. Lyra, that though “we are not to pray for the condemned,” yet we may pray for such a sinner, “that he may sin less, and so be less condemned in hell:” or as Bengel, “God willeth not that the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15OGNWZWkNoEchndyT8rnhN4g0wiIvzBC/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

If therefore one who has committed mortal sin is brought back to life, it is from the mere divine purpose, reserved from us.” Calvin indeed holds fast the prohibition in all its strictness, but only in extreme cases: adding, “But, seeing that this happens most rarely, and God, commending the immense riches of His grace, commands us to be merciful after His example: we must pass upon any man the judgment of eternal death, but rather charity should induce us to hope well of him. But if the desperate impiety of some looks to us hardly short of a pointing it out by the finger of the Lord God, it is not for us to contend with the just judgment of God, or desire to be more merciful than He is.” <br><br>Certainly this seems, reserving the question as to the nature of the sin, the right view of the words, <b>I say not</b>. By an express command in the other case, and then as express an exclusion of this case from that command, nothing short of an implied prohibition can be conveyed.<br><br>The second point here relates to the difference between <b>ask </b>and <b>make request</b>. The <i>Greek </i>word represented by the former is more of the petition <i>of the inferior</i>, as of the conquered, or of the guilty: that re-represented by the latter is more general, of the request <i>of the equal</i>, or of one who has a right. Our Lord never uses the former of His own requests to God, but always the latter. And this difference is of importance here. The <b>asking </b>for a sin not unto death is a humble and trusting petition in the direction of God’s will, and prompted by brotherly love: the other, the <b>making request</b> for a sin unto death, would be, it is implied, an act savouring of presumption—a prescribing to God, in a matter which lies out of the bounds of our brotherly yearning [for notice, the hypothesis that a man sees <i>a brother</i> sin a sin unto death is not adduced in words, because such a sinner would not truly be a brother, but thereby demonstrated never to have deserved that name: see ch. ii. 19], how He shall inflict and withhold His righteous judgments.<br><br>And these latter considerations bring us close to the question as to the nature of the sin unto death. It would be impossible to enumerate or even classify the opinions which have been given on the subject. Düsterdieck has devoted many pages to such a classification and discussion. I ean do no more than point out the canons of interpretation, and some of the principal divergencies. But before doing so, ver. 17 must come under consideration).<h2><u><b>17.</b></u></h2> <b>All unrighteousness is sin</b> (in the words <b>all unrighteousness</b> we have a reminiscence of ch. i. 9, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from <b>all unrighteousness</b>,” and also, but not so directly, of ch. iii, 4, which is virtually the converse proposition to this. Here the Apostle seems to say, in explanation of what he has just written, “SIN is a large word, comprehending all unrighteousness whatever: whether of God's children, or of aliens from Him.” The thoughts which have been brought into these words,—that <i>unrighteousness</i> is a mild word, meant to express that every slight trip of the good Christian fills under the category of sin, and so. there may be a sin not unto death, —or, on the other hand, that it is a strong word, as Grotius says, “he calls unrighteousness not every ignorance or sudden fall into sin, but sin committed either with deliberation, or with space given for deliberation,” —or thirdly, as Beza, that “all sins are so far equal, that even the least thought of the least sin deserves eternal death a thousand times over,” and “that all sins are of themselves deadly,”—are equally far from the meaning of the words, whose import is, as above, to account for there being a sin not unto death as well as a sin unto death); <b>and there is a sin not unto death</b> (not having death for its issue: within the limit of that <i>unrighteousness</i>, from all of which God cleanseth all those who confess their sins, ch. i. 9).<br><br>Our <i>first </i>canon of interpretation of the <i>sin unto death</i> and the <i>sin not unto death</i> is this: that <i>the </i><b>death </b><i>and the</i> <b>life</b><i> of the passage must correspond.</i> The former cannot be bodily death, while the latter is eternal and spiritual life. This clears away at once all those Commentators who understand the sin unto death to be one for which bodily death is the punishment, either by human law generally, or by sickness inflicted by God; or of which there will be no end till the death of the sinner, which Bede thinks possible, and<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v8mh3vIt2y__dt7EP0uPa2Navj-agDlp/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This last is evidently absurd, for how is a man to know whether this will be so or not ?<br><br>Our <i>second </i>canon will be, that this sin unto death being thus a sin leading to eternal death, being no further explained to the readers here, must be presumed <i>as meant to be understood by what the Evangelist has elsewhere laid down</i> concerning the possession of life and death. Now we have from him a definition immediately preceding this, in ver, 12. <i>“He that hath the Son hath life: he that hath not the Son of God, the life hath he not.”</i> Aud we may safely say that the words <b>unto death</b> here are to be understood as meaning, “involving the loss of <i>this life</i> which men have only by union with the Son of God.” And this meaning they must have, not by implication only, which would be the case if any obstinate and determined sin were meant, which would be a sign of the fact of severance from the life which is in Christ [see iii, 14, 15, where the inference is of this kind], but directly and essentially, i.e. in respect of that very sin which is pointed at by them. Now against this canon are all those interpretations, far too numerous to mention, which make <i>any</i> atrocious and obstinate sin to be that intended. It is obvious that our limits are thus confined to <i>abnegation of Christ</i>, not as inferred by its fruits otherwise shewn, but as the act of sin itself. And so, with various shades of difference as to the putting forth in detail, most of the best Commentators both ancient and modern.<br><br>Our <i>third </i>canon will help us to decide, within the above limits, what especial sin is intended. And it is, that by the very analogy of the context, it must be <i>not a state of sin, but an appreciable </i>ACT <i>of sin</i>, seeing that that which is opposed to it <i>in the same kind</i>, as being not unto death, is described by <i>“if any man see his brother sinning, &c.”</i> So that all interpretations which make it to be a <i>state </i>of apostacy, do not reach the matter of detail which is before the Apostle’s mind.<br><br>In enquiring what this is, we must be guided by the analogy of what St. John says elsewhere. <i>Our</i> state being that of life in Jesus Christ, there are those who have gone out from us, not being of us, ch. ii. 19, who are called “<i>antichrists,</i>” who not only “have not” Christ, but are Christ’s enemies, denying the Father and the Son [ii. 22], whom we are not even to receive into our houses nor to greet [2 John 10, 11]. These seem to be the persons pointed at here, and this the sin: viz. the denial that Jesus is the Christ, the incarnate Son of God. This alone of all sins bears upon it the stamp of severance from Him who is the Life itself. As the confession of Christ, with the mouth and in the heart, is salvation unto life [Rom. x. 9], so denial of Christ with the month and in the heart, is sin unto death. This alone of all the proposed solutions seems to satisfy all the canons above laid down. For in it, the life cast away and the death incurred strictly correspond: it strictly corresponds to what St. John has elsewhere said concerning life and death, and derives its explanation from those other passages, especially from the foregoing ver. 12: and it is an appreciable act of sin, one against which the readers have been before repeatedly cautioned [ch. ii. 18 ff., iv. 1 ff., v.5, 11, 12]. And further, it is in exact accordance with other passages of Scripture which seem to point at a sin similarly distinguished above others: viz. Matt. xii. 31 ff., and, so far as the circumstances there dealt with allow common ground, with the more ethical passages, Heb. vi. 4 ff., x. 25 ff. In the former case, the Scribes and Pharisees were resisting the Holy Ghost [Acts vii. 51], who was manifesting God in the flesh in the Person and work of Christ. For them the Lord Himself does not pray (Luke xxiii, 34): they knew what they did: they went out from God’s people and were not of them: receiving and repudiating the testimony of the Holy Ghost to the Messiahship of Jesus.<h2><u><b>18–20.</b></u></h2> <i>Three solemn maxims of </i>the Epistle regarding sin and the children of God and the world, and our eternal life in Christ, <i>are repeated </i>as a <i>close</i> of the teachig of the Apostle. Ver. 18 seems to be not without reference to what has just been said concerning sin. In actual life, even our brethren, even we ourselves, born of God, shall sin, not unto death, and require brotherly intercession: but in the depth and truth of the Christian life, sin is altogether absent. It is the world, not knowing God, which lies under the power of the wicked one: God’s new-begotten children he cannot touch: they are in and<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 2, Part 2, 1 John, Pages 569-571 missing.</h2><br><h1>Book: 2 John</h1><br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 2, Part 2, 2 John, Pages 572-576 missing.</h2><br><h1>Book: 3 John</h1><br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 2, Part 2, 3 John, Pages 577-580 missing.</h2><br><h1>Book: Jude</h1><br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 2, Part 2, Jude, Pages 581-591 missing.</h2><br><h1>Book: Revelation</h1><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHlWB7CdVXmHJeOqAz5dhgHl3sNyZ3iq/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Is not Christ very God, of one essence with the Father from eternity? Did He not, by virtue of the omniscience of His divine nature, know as exactly as the Father, what should be the process of the world’s history, what the fate of the Church? What purpose was served by a revelation from God to Jesus?” He proceeds to say that the words cannot refer merely to the revelation as made to <i>us</i>, but are clearly against such an interpretation: and gives, at some length and very well, that which in one form or other all will accept as the true explanation, in accordance with John vii. 16, xiv. 10, xvii. 7,8. The man Christ Jesus, even in His glorified state, receives from the Father, by his hypostatic union with Him, that revelation which by His Spirit He imparts to His Church. For, Acts i. 7, the times and seasons are kept by the Father in His own power: and of the day and the hour knoweth no man, not the angels in heaven, nor even the Son, but the Father only, Mark xiii. 32.

And the verb <b>shew </b>must not here be confined to its stricter meaning of shewing in vision: for then we must confine the reference of <i>“his servants”</i> to the Apocalyptic Seer alone: but must be taken in its wider sense of exhibiting as knowledge, informing of.

This expression must not be urged to signify that the events of apocalyptic prophecy were to be close at hand: for we have a key to its meaning in Luke xviii. 8, where our Lord says, <i>“Shall not God avenge His elect, which cry unto Him day and night, even if He is </i><b>long-suffering</b><i> with them? I say unto you that He will avenge them </i><b>shortly</b>:” where long delay is evidently implied. Hengstenberg, repudiates this, and says it is self-evident that these words can only be adduced here “by a wrong method of interpretation.” But surely the two cases are exactly parallel: and his strong language here, as elsewhere, proves nothing. His own interpretation of the words, natural as he seems to think it, is forced and unwarrantable. He (in common with many others) takes them to mean that the events spoken of would very soon <i>begin </i>to take place, The axe, he says, lay at the root of the Roman Empire when John wrote this, as it did at the root of the Persian Empire when Daniel wrote. But this interpretation is not borne out by the Greek. The words cannot signify “which must soon <i>begin </i>to come to pass,” but, “which, in their entirety, must soon come to pass.” So that we are driven to the very same sense of <b>shortly </b>as that in Luke xviii. above, viz. to <i>God's speedy time</i>, though He seem to delay: in spite of the scorn which Hengstenberg pours on this meaning. His maxim, that a Prophet, speaking to men, must speak according to men’s ideas, is quite worthless, and may be confuted by any similar prophetic saying, even by the one which he brings in its favour, Hagg. ii. 7: and his complaint, that thus we make the Seer and even the Lord Himself like bad physicians who delude their patients with false hopes [so, in the main, Stern also], is unworthy of a Christian Expositor, after our Lord’s own plain use of the same method of speech again and again in His prophecies in the Gospels and in this book. It remains to observe, that these words cannot with any fairness be used as furnishing a guide to the interpretation of the prophecy. They are far rather to be regarded as a prophetic formula, common with Him to whom a thousand years are as one day, and used in order to teach us how short our time, and the time of this our world, is. See on the whole, Fbrard’s able note, and his remarks on the absurdity of Hengstenberg’s pressing the words in favour of his præterist. scheme); <b>and He</b> (<i>Jesus Christ</i>, not <i>God</i>, see ch. xxii, 16: the subject is changed, and the relative construction abandoned. So almost all Commentators) <b>signified [it] sending by His angel</b> (the Angel mentioned is the same who informs the Seer in chap. xvii. 1, 7, 15, xix. 9, xxi. 9, xxii. 1, 6, which latter place takes up this; ib. 8 ff.; and who is spoken of by our Lord ib. 16. It is remarkable that this angel docs not appear as the imparter of the visions until ch. xvii. Some indeed, as Ewald, have fancied that they trace his presence in ch. Iv. 1 and throughout: but ch. Xvii. 1 is too manifestly the introduction to a new appearance for this to be the case; and previously to that the Seer receives his information from different persons. Our Lord Himself opens the Apocalyptic vision; but it is another voice which calls John up to the place of heavenly vision, ch. iv. 1. In vii. 13, one of the four and twenty elders speaks to him: in x. 8, it is the former voice again which addresses him, and in ib. 9, it is the angel who stands on the earth and the sea that gives him the book. Only in the great close of the prophecy, opening with ch. xvii., does one angel stand by him; referred to, as here, under the name <b>the angel</b>. In the visions of Daniel and Zechariah an angel mediated: Dan. viii. 16, ix. 20, x. 10 ff., Zech. i. 1, 19, al.) <b>to His servant John </b>(on the whole question of the writer of the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gRQo-RJ6dDzxkTaioydSGPAaAET8ZS2/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The reasons given by Ebrard for such reference will not hold: see my Greek Test. Besides, the Evangelist distinctly tells us, John xx. 30, that in writing his Gospel, he did not set down <b>as much as he saw</b>, but only a portion of the things which Jesus did in the presence of His disciples, whereas in the case of this Revelation it was otherwise: he set down all which he saw, as a faithful transmitter of the Apocalyptic vision to the churches).<h2><u><b>3.</u></h2> Blessed is</b> (or <i>be</i>, in the ordinary meaning of <b>blessed</b>: not necessarily referring on to eternal blessedness, as Hengst.) <b>he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy and observe the things written in it; for the time is near </b>(it can hardly be reasonably denied that in the terms, <b>he that readeth</b>, and <b>they that hear</b>, the Apostle had in his mind the one public reader and the many hearers. And so the great majority of Commentators. If the words are to be thus understood as above, they form at least a solemn rebuke to the most unjustifiable practice of the Church of England, which omits with one or two exceptions the whole of this book from her public readings. Not one word of the precious messages of the Spirit to the Churches is ever heard in the public services of a Church never weary of appealing to her <i>Scriptural </i>liturgies. Surely it is high time, that our timid rulers should gather courage to face their duties, and such an omission should be supplied.— Notice that not three classes of persons, but two only, are here indicated: he that reads, and they that hear and do.<br><br><b>those things which are written therein</b> are the several exhortations to repentance, faith, patience, obedience, prayer, watchfulness, stedfastness, which are scattered up and down in the prophecy. The <i>time being near </i>makes the book of the more importance. and the blessedness of reading and observing it greater. The <i>nearness </i>spoken of is to be understood as alluding to the <b>shortly </b>of verse 1, which see. We know little now of relative nearness and distance in point of time: when the day of the Lord shall have opened our eyes to the true measure, we shall see, how near it always was).<h2><u>CH. I. 4—III. 22</u></h2> INTRODUCTION TO THE PROPHECY, in the form of a <i>sevenfold Epistle</i> to the seven churches of Asia, And herein, vv. 4, 5, <i>address and greeting</i>, ending with <i>doxology</i>. [Ebrard, who seems to love singularity for its own sake, objects to the above arrange- ment, because the sevenfold epistle has not yet begun, and prefers calling this a dedicatory title to the whole book. But the other view is far simpler and better. The sevenfold Epistle is clearly before St. John’s mind, and, full of the images of the vision which he had seen, he only interrupts it by solemn ejaculatory references to the glories of that vision and the sublime announcement of the Lord’s coming, and then hastens on to introduce it by a prefatory account of his own circumstances when the Epistles were entrusted to him, and of the appearance of the Lord who thus entrusted them.] <b>John to the seven churches which are in Asia</b> (the form of address is exactly that in the Epistles of St. Paul: see Rom. i. 1 ff., 1 Cor.i.1 ff., &c. That St. Paul, in Romans and elsewhere, is careful to designate himself and his office, and St. John introduces himself without any such designation,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3SFHwOQcjvShRinvCO0ZFyebI2oIWTc/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

See this, and other evidence as to the authorship, urged in the Introduction. See on the seven churches below, ver. 11. <b>Asia</b>, as always in the New Test., is the proconsular province so called. It consisted of Phrygia, Mysia, Caria, and Lydia: under Mysia and Lydia including Ionia and Æolia, and the neighbouring islands of the Ægean. It was called proconsular, because it was governed by one of consular rank, under the title of proconsul): <b>Grace be to you and peace</b> (so St. Paul in all his Epistles except the three pastoral) <b>from Him who is and who was and who is to come</b> (a paraphrase of the unspeakable name <i>Jehovah</i>, resembling the paraphrase “I AM THAT I AM” in Exod. iii. 14, for which the Jerusalem Targum has, as here, “HE WHO WAS AND IS AND IS TO COME:” as has the Targum of Jonathan in Deut. xxxii. 39. It follows from what is remarked above, that the meaning of <b>is to come</b> is not here to be pressed as referring to any future <i>coming</i>. By doing so we should confuse the meaning of the compound appellation, which evidently is all to be applied to the Father. By some <b>He which is</b> is sup- posed to mean the Father, <b>which was</b> the Son [“<i>in the beginning</i> <b>was </b><i>the Word</i>”), and <b>which is to come</b> the Spirit, as ever proceeding forth and descending on the Church), <b>and from the seven spirits which [are] before His throne</b> (Audreas takes these for the seven principal angels [ch. viii. 2]: so also many other Commentators. But this is highly improbable, as these angels are never <i>called </i>“<b>spirits</b>,” and as surely mere creatures, however exalted, would not be equalized with the Father and the Son as fountains of grace. The common view is doubtless right, which regards the seven as <i>the energies of the Holy Spirit:</i>— “Thou the anointing Spirit art, Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart:” but rather perhaps to be regarded as expressing His plenitude and perfection, than to be separately assigned as [but query?] in the lines following of the hymn Veni Creator Spiritus. The key to this expression, which is an anticipation of the visions afterwards to be related, is ch. v. 6, where see notes: as also on ch. iv. 5. The <b>seven </b>can hardly be entirely without allusion to the <i>seven churches</i>, and to the <i>sevenfold </i>imagery throughout. The number seven denotes completeness, and was much noted by the Jewish Commentators as occurring in the Old Test. The seven spirits betoken the completeness and universality of working of God’s Holy Spirit, as the seven churches typify and indicate the whole church. The reference to Isa. xi. 2 is but lamely made out, there being there but <i>six</i> energies of the Spirit mentioned. That to Zech. iv. 2, 10 is more to the point: see notes as above), <b>and from Jesus Christ</b> (as we have before had the Father and the Holy Spirit mentioned as the sources of grace and peace, so now the Son, coming last, on account of that which is to follow respecting Him, which has respect to His threefold office of Prophet, King, and Priest: see however below), <b>the faithful witness </b>(see John xviii, 37, “<i>To this end came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.</i>” It is to the general mission of the Redeemer to bear witness to the truth, and not merely to the apocalyptic portion of His testimony which is to follow, that this title must be referred. This book [ver. 2] <i>is the testimony of Jesus Christ</i>: But the <i>title </i>reaches far wider. Embracing as it does that <i>testimony </i>before Pontins Pilate, and indeed that of His whole life of witnessing to the truth, we can perhaps hardly say that it marks out his prophetic office with sufficient distinctness for us to believe it indicated here), <b>the first-born of the dead</b> (death is regarded as the womb of the earth, from which the resurrection<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nodvJllx7a97razykUkhJqtFuuDT_3ji/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

As there St. John evidently shews what a deep impression the whole circumstance here referred to produced on his own mind, so it is remarkable here that he should again take up the prophecy of Zechariah [xii. 10] which he there cites, and speak of it as fulfilled. That this should be so, and that it should be done with the same word <b>pierced him</b>, not found in the Septuagint version of the passage, is a strong presumption that the Gospel and the Apocalypse were written by the same person. The persons intended in this expression are beyond doubt those to whom our Lord prophesied in like terms, Matt. xxvi. 64; viz. those who were His murderers, whether the Jews who delivered Him to be crucified, or the Romans, who actually inflicted His death. That the meaning must not here be generalized to signify all who have by their sins crucified the Son of God afresh, is plain from the consideration that this class are taken out from among that indicated by <i>“every eye shall see Him”</i> which precedes, whereas on that supposition they would be identical with it; for we all have pierced Him in this sense), <b>and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn at Him</b> (i.e. their mourning shall be directed towards Him as its object: in fear for themselves in regard to the consequences of His coming.<br><br>The prophecy is in allusion to Matt. xxiv. 30; and its sense, that all, even the holiest of men, shall mourn at the visible approach of that day. But as Bengel well remarks, there will be then two causes of mourning: <i>hostile terror,</i> and <i>penitential terror.</i> The former will prevail in the impenitent and careless world; the latter even in the comforted and rejoicing church. The holiest saint, when that Presence is manifested, in the midst of his “Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him and He will save us,” will personally feel with St. Peter, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.” The whole is an adaptation and amplification of the words of Zechariah xii. 10). <b>Yea, Amen</b> (both these words are used in 2 Cor. i. 20 as forms of ratification.

Indeed from his entire silence respecting himself in his Gospel, we may well believe that here, where mention of his name was absolutely required, it would. be introduced thus humbly and unobtrusively), <b>and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance</b> [or, <b>patience</b>] <b>in Jesus</b> (the construction and arrangement are peculiar. The conjunction of these terms seems to be made to express, a partaker, as in the kingdom, so in the tribulation and endurance which are in and by Christ: but the insertion of <b>kingdom </b>between <b>tribulation </b>and <b>endurance</b> is startling. Probably, the tribulation brings in the kingdom [Acts xiv. 22], and then as a corrective to the idea that the kingdom in its blessed fulness was yet present, the endurance is subjoined. “John introduces three portions of inheritances in which he declares himself partaker. But the middle one of these, i.e. the kingdom, cannot be possessed, unless with the exercise of tribulation on the one side, and the defence of patience on the other.” Ambrose Ansbert [8th century]), <b>was </b>(found myself) <b>in the island which is called Patmos</b> (see Introduction, § ii. par. 4) <b>on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus</b> (the substantives form the same expression as occurred before, ver. 2, where see note. There they indicated <i>this</i> portion of the divine word and testimony, of which John was a faithful reporter. Whether their meaning is the same here, will depend partly on what sense we assign to <b>“on account of.”</b> In St. Paul’s usage, it would here signify <i>for the sake of,</i> i.e. for the purpose of receiving: so that the Apostle would thus have gone to Patmos by special revelation in order to receive this revelation. Again, keeping to this meaning, these words may mean, that he had visited Patmos in pursuance of, for the purposes of, his ordinary apostolic employment, which might well be designated by these substantives. And such perhaps would have been our acceptation of the words, but that three objections intervene. 1) From what has preceded in this verse, a strong impression remains on the mind that St. John wrote this in a season of tribulation and persecution. Why should he throw over his address this tinge of suffering given by the tribulation and patience, if this were not the case? 2) The usage of our Writer himself in two passages where he speaks of death by persecution [ch. vi. 9, xx. 4] shews that with him <b>on account of</b> [or, <b>for</b>] in this connexion is <i>“because of,”</i> <i>“in consequence of.”</i> And St. John’s own, usage is a better guide in St. John’s writings, than that of St. Paul. Besides which, Origen’s Greek ear found no offence in this usage, for he incorporated it into his own sentence, ... “He condemned John in his testimony, on account of the word of truth, to the island Patmos.” 3) An early patristic tradition relates that St. John was banished to Patmos. See the authorities in the Introduction, and the question discussed, whether we are justified in ascribing this tradition solely to our present passage. These considerations, mainly those arising from the passage itself, compel us, I believe, to understand the words of an exile in Patmos).<h2><u><b>10, 11.</u></h2></b> <b>I was</b> (“Je me trouvais:” not merely <i>“I was,”</i> but <i>“I became”</i>) <b>in the Spirit</b> (i.e. in a state of spiritual ecstasy or trance, becoming thereby receptive of the vision or revelation to follow.

Ebrard well says, “Connexion with surrounding objects through the senses is suspended, and a connexion with the invisible world established.” On the attempt made by some to give the words a different meaning, see below) <b>on the Lord’s day</b> (i.e. on the first day of the week, kept by the Christian church as the weekly festival of the Lord’s resurrection. On any probable hypothesis of the date of this book, this is the earliest mention of the day by this name. This circumstance, coupled with a bias in favour of a peculiar method of interpretation, has led certain modern interpreters, of whom, as far as I know, Wetstein was the first, to interpret the words of the day of <i>the Lord’s coming.</i> So Züllig, and in our own country, Drs. S. R. Maitland and Todd. But 1) the difficulty of the thus early occurrence of this term, <i>“the Lord’s day,”</i> is no real one. Dr. Maitland says [sce Todd’s Lectures on the Apoc., Note B, p. 295], “I know of nothing in the Scripture or in the works of the ante-Nicene Fathers on which to ground such an assumption.” To this we may answer, that the extent of Dr. Maitland’s knowledge of the ante-Nicene Fathers does not, happily for us, decide the question: as the expression occurs repeatedly in those very Fathers: see the citations in my Greek Test. Mr. Elliott, Hor. Apoc. iv. 367 note, has pointed out that the primitive Syriac version renders 1 Cor. xi. 20, “not as befitteth the day of the Lord ye eat and drink,” which is an interesting proof of the early usage. This chronological objection being disposed of, and the matter 2) taken on its own merits, it really is astonishing how any even moderate Greek scholars ean persuade themselves that the words can mean that which these Commentators maintain. See this shewn in my Greck Test.): <b>and I heard a voice</b> (see Ezek. iii. 12) <b>behind me</b> (Isa. xxx. 21),<b> great as of a trumpet, saying</b> (the trumpet is the instrument of festal proclamation, Numb. x. 10: John ii. 15, &c.: accompanies divine manifestations, Exod. xix. 19 f.; Joel ii. 1: Matt. xxiv. 31; 1 Thess. iv. 16. The similarity to the sound of the trampet here was it the loudness and clearness of the voice: see also ch. iv. 1. From this latter it appears that this voice was not that of our Lord, but of one who there also spoke to the Apostle.

Each local church has now its candlestick, to be retained or removed from its place according to its own works):<h2><u><b>13.</u></h2> and in the midst of the candlesticks one like to the Son of Man</b> (i.e. to Christ: see John v. 27: not simply, <i>“to a son of man”</i>)<b>, clothed in a garment reaching to the feet</b> (see the reff. in Daniel and Ezekiel, which the description and even the diction closely resemble.

Some suppose a distinction—the girding round the loins betokening activity, while that round the breast is a sign of repose. But Hengstenberg well observes that this would hardly apply: for Christ is here in fulness of energy as ruler and orderer of His Church. Ebrard seems nearer the truth in regarding the higher girding as a sign of majesty. But perhaps after all the point is not to be pressed; for the angels in ch. xv. 6 are also girt <i>round the breasts</i>. Nor is the golden girdle distinctive of regal majesty: for this they also bear, ibid.):<h2><u><b>14.</u></h2> and his head and his hairs [were] white like white wool, as snow</b> (by the <b>head </b>is perhaps indicated the forehead; not the face, which is afterwards described.

The whiteness signifies <i>purity </i>and <i>glory</i>, not as Augustine and others think, <i>eternity,</i> either here or in Dan. vii. 9), <b>and his eyes as a flame of fire</b> (so Dan. x. 6: representing perhaps, as Vitringa says, “the perspicacity of the divine and pure mind, piercing all secrets.” This may be, notwithstanding that Gabriel has eyes like lamps of fire in Daniel. Though <i>omniscience</i> could not be ascribed to him, the figure might be relatively consistent. But it is perhaps better to consider these physical details rather as in themselves characteristic, than as emblematic of attributes lying beneath them. The “fiery eye” among the sons of men, is indicative of energy and power of command: so also in the Son of man Himself):<h2><u><b>15.</u></h2></b> <b>and his feet were like to chalcolibanus</b> (so literally.

De Wette well remarks that <i>this</i>, which is the more natural rendering, is also required by the symbolism. If the seven churches which the seven stars symbolize, were <i>on </i>the Lord’s hand as rings, they would seem to be serving (adorning ?) Him, and not to be the objects of his action: but now that He <i>holds them in</i> his hand, He appears as their Guardian, their Provider, their Nourisher: and, we may add, their Possessor, who brings them out and puts them forth to be seen when He pleases. His universal Church would hardly be thus represented, but only a portion of it which it pleases Him to take in his hand and hold forth as representing the rest): <b>and out of his mouth a two- edged sharp sword going forth</b> (compare Isa. xi. 4, xlix, 2: also our ch. ii. 16, and Wisd. xviii. 15. The same figure occurs with reference to <i>men </i>in Ps. lv. 21, lvii. 4, lix. 7: and examples of it are given from the Rabbinical writings. The thing signified may perhaps be as in 2 Thess. ii. 8, and in ch. xix. 21; but clearly we must not exclude the attributes of the <i>word of God</i>, Heb. iv. 12, Eph. vi. 17. And this all the more, inasmuch as 1) here the Lord is represented not as taking vengeance on his enemies, but as speaking with his own, both in the way of comforting and of threatening: and 2) in ch. xix. 21, where this very sword is again alluded to as slaying the Lord’s enemies, His title as sitting upon the horse is <i>“the word of God”</i>):<b> and his countenance</b> (not <i>general appearance</i>. Had this been so, how should the Apostle have noted the details just mentioned? for the whole figure of our Lord would have been too dazzling for him to contemplate. It is natural that after describing the eyes, and that which proceeded from the mouth, he should give the general effect of the countenance) <b>as the sun shineth in his strength</b> (sce Judges v. 31: —that is, when unclouded and in full power: not necessarily at midday, but at any time. The construction is again broken: <i>“as the sun shining”</i> would be the regular connexion).<h2><u><b>17, 18.</u></h2></b> <b>And when I saw Him, I fell at his feet as dead</b> (the effect of the divine appearance: see Exod. xxxiii. 20; Job xlii. 6; Isa. vi. 5; Ezek. i. 28; Dan. viii. 17 ff., x. 7 ff. There is no discrepancy in this bodily action with the spiritual nature of the vision, as De Wette thinks, either here or in the places where similar physical effects are described. ch. v. 4, xix. 10, xxii. 8 [Dan. vii. 15]. Düsterdieck well remarks in reply, that the <i>being in the Spirit</i> does not supersede existence in the body. Just as dreamers express their bodily feelings by physical acts, e.g. by starting or weeping, so might St. John while in this ecstasy : see Acts ix. 3). <b>And he placed his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not</b> (see Dan. x. 12, Luke i. 13, 30, ii. 10, Matt. xvii. 7, Mark xvi. 6.

By this mention of His own death and revival, the Lord reassures His Apostle.

The Targum of Jonathan on Deut. xxviii. 12 says, “There are four keys in the hand of the Lord . . . the key of life, of the tombs, of food, and of rain” We have the <i>gates</i> of death as opposed to the gates of the daughter of Zion, Ps. ix. 14; cf. also Job xxxviii. 17; and the gates of Hadés, Matt. xvi. 16, Isa. xxxviii. 10).<h2><u><b>19.</u></h2> Write therefore</b> (‘because I have vouchsafed thee this vision,—I whose majesty is such, and whose manifested loving-kindness to thee.” ‘The connexion is better thus than with ver. 11, as some: “Now that thy fear is over, write what I bade thee.” But it is very doubtful whether ver. 11 is spoken by our Lord at all: see there) t<b>he things which thou sawest </b>(just now: the vision which was but now vouchsafed thee), <b>and what things they are</b> (two meanings of the words thus rendered are possible. 1) <i>‘the things which are,’</i> viz. which exist at the present time. This has been taken by many Commentators, ancient and modern. 2) as above, <i>“what things they </i>[the things which thou sawest] <i>are,”</i> i.e. <i>signify:</i> so some of the ancients and moderns. Both on account of the construction in the original [see my Greck Test.], and because the verb <b>are</b>, unquestionably in this meaning of <i>signify</i>, occurs twice in the next verse, I have no hesitation in taking this latter meaning, as given above), <b>and the things which are about to happen after these </b>(viz. after the things which thou sawest: the next vision, beginning with ch. iv., which itself opens with <i>“after these things </i>I saw.”<i> </i>I would take the verb <b>be </b>in the sense of happening, not in the wide ages of history, but in <i>apocalyptic vision:</i> seeing that, <b>these </b>things meaning “the things which thou sawest,” <i>a present vision</i>,<b> the things which shall be</b> will by analogy mean the things which shall succeed these, i.e. a future vision. Notice, it is not <i>“the things which must come to pass,”</i> as in ver. 1: not the necessity of prophecy, but only the sequence of things seen);<h2><u><b>20.</u></h2> the mystery</b> (i.e. the secret signification) <b>of the seven stars which thou sawest upon</b> (held in, and so standing over, as a wreath) <b>my right hand, and the seven candlesticks of gold</b> (elliptic construction for <i>‘and the mystery of the seven candlesticks,’</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STNPG2_p0yQZMLx26MO-d_on6wnSlAST/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 2, Part 2, Page 603:</a></h3><br> &c.).—<b>The seven stars are</b> (signify) [the] <b>angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks are seven churches </b>(the import of the <b>angels </b>has been much disputed. Very many both ancient and modern Commentators take them for the <i>presiding presbyters</i>, or <i>bishops</i>, of the churches. This view is variously supported. It derives probability from the analogy of the vision itself, in which, seeing that the candelabra represent the churches themselves, existing vessels containing much light, the stars, concentrated sparks of light, should represent some actually existing persons in or connected with the churches. Again it is supported by our finding that throughout the seven Epistles the angel is treated as representing and responsible for the particular church. But before we pass on to the other great section of interpretation, we may at once dismiss those forms of this one which make the <i>angel </i>the <i>ideal representative</i> of the governing body, or an <i>ideal messenger</i> from the church, or an anticipatory idea of the office of Bishop, not yet instituted : or, in short, any idealism at all. As the <i>church </i>is an objective reality, so must the <i>angel </i>be, of whatever kind. This consideration will also affect the current of interpretation which takes the angels to be <i>the churches themselves</i>. The second line of interpretation is that which regards them as <i>angels</i>, in some way representing the churches. In favour of this is 1) the constant usage of this book, in which the word <b>angel </b>occurs only in this sense: 2) the further usage of this book, in which we have, ch. xvi. 4, the <i>angel of the waters</i> introduced without any explanation, who can be none other than the angel presiding over the waters: 3) the expression of our Lord Himself, Matt. xviii. 10, <i>“their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven,”</i> coupled with that expressed by the church in the house of Mary the mother of John Mark, Acts xii. 15, with regard to their disbelief of Peter standing at the door, <i>“it is his angel :”</i> both asserting the doctrine that angels are allotted to persons, and are regarded as representing them: a subject full of mystery, and requiring circumspect treatment, but by no means to be put aside, as is commonly done. 4) The extension of this from individuals to nations in the book of Daniel, which is so often the key to apocalyptic interpretation. See Dan. x. 21, xii. 1: an analogy according to which there might well be angels not only of individuals, but of churches. 5) The fact that throughout these Epistles, nothing is ever addressed individually as to a teacher, but as to some one person reflecting as it were the complexion and fortunes of the church ina way in which no mere human teacher or ruler could. That there is no exception to this in ch. ii. 20, see maintained in note there. 6) To the objection advanced in the comment of Arethas, that “<i>the presiding angel had not sinned</i>, so as to want exhorting to repent, &c.,” the reply may be made, with advantage to this interpretation, that there evidently is revealed to us a mysterious connexion between ministering angels and those to whom they minister, by which the former in some way are tinged by the fates and fortunes of the latter. E. g. in our Lord’s saying cited above, the place of dignity there asserted of the angels of the little children is unquestionably connected with the character of those whose angels they are: and it cannot be following out such a revelation too far to say that, if some of the holy angels are thus and for this reason advanced to honour, others may be similarly, and for the opposite reason, placed in less honour and relatively disgraced. That this idea is found expressed in the Rabbinical writings is a mark of the further development of the truth, which seems to have been first revealed to Daniel. 7) It will be perceived that this interpretation does not lie under any of the objections stated above as idealizing that which ought to be an objective reality. For it contemplates the angels of the churches as really existent, not as ideal beings. It is only when this latter is the case, that those objections can apply. 8) It will also be perceived, that both the circumstances, which were cited as making for the former interpretation, tell equally for this: viz. a) that just noticed, the actual existence of these persons in or belonging to the churches, and b) the fact that in the Epistles the angel is treated as representing and responsible for the particular church.<br><br>So that I cannot but regard this second<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W7N2f4MgFxoy6uPkO_3o8H241G63K5CF/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Views have considerably differed respecting the character of these Epistles, whether they are to be regarded as simply historical, or historico- prophetical, or simply prophetical. The point on which all, I presume, will be agreed is, that the words contained in these Epistles are applicable to and intended for the guidance, warning, and encouragement of the whole Church Catholic, and its several parts, throughout all time. The differing interpretations will here be only briefly alluded to. One account of them will be found in Vitringa’s (Latin) Commentary, pp.27—58: and (but scantily, as most interpreters pass over this portion of the book slightly) in the introductions to the principal commentaries. See also Abp. Trench’s Appendix to his Commentary on the Seven Epistles, pp. 209—225.<br><br>Before commenting on each individual Epistle, I would notice the similar construction of all. This may be thus described. Each Epistle contains, 1. A command, to write to the angel of the particular church. 2. A sublime title of our Lord, taken for the most part from the imagery of the preceding vision. 3. An address to the angel of the church, always commencing with <i>I know</i>, introducing a statement of its present circumstances: continuing with an exhortation either to repentance or to constancy : and ending with a prophetic announcement, mostly respecting what shall be at the Lord’s coming. 4. A promise made to <i>“him that overcometh,”</i> generally accompanied with a solemn call to earnest attention, <i>“He that hath an ear, &c.”</i><h2><u><b>1—7.</u></h2></b>—THE EPISTLE TO THE CHURCH AT EPHESUS. <b>To the angel of the church in Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth fast</b> (compare ch. ii. 25, iii.11) <b>the seven stars in his right hand, He that walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks of gold </b>(assertions of Christ’s being the Lord, the Governor and the Upholder of His Church, agreeably to the vision of ch. i.: coming in suitably in this first Epistle, as beginning the complete number): <b>I know </b>(am aware of: not as some explain it, <i>approve</i>.

But there can I think be little question that the language is <i>conjugal</i>, and the love, as Ambrose Ansbert [“thou hast cast away the affection of a chaste spouse”], and others,—the first fervent chaste and pure love of the newly-wedded bride: see Jer. ii. 2.<br><br>In what particular the Ephesian church had left her first love, is not stated. Perhaps, as Ansbert says, “she was excited with the love of this world:” or, seeing that it is negative, rather than positive delinquency which is blamed, the love of first conversion had waxed cold, and given place to a lifeless and formal orthodoxy). <b>Remember therefore whence thou hast fallen</b> (the first fervour of love is regarded as a height, from which the church had declined), <b>and repent</b> (quickly and effectually, as the tense in the original implies), <b>and do the first works </b>(the works which sprung from that thy first love: those resume); <b>but if not, I [will] come to thee</b> (not Christ's final coming, but his coming in special judgment is here indicated), <b>and will move thy candlestick out of its place </b>(i.e. will make thee cease to be a church: see the fulfilment noticed in Introd., § iii. par. 7),<b> if thou do not repent</b> (shalt not have repented; i. e. by the speedy time indicated in the previous command).<h2><u><b>6.</u></h2></b> <b>Notwithstanding, this thou hast </b>(this one thing: there is no need to supply <i>“good”</i> or the like: of what sort<i> this one thing </i>is, is explained by what follows. We may notice the tender compassion of our blessed Lord, who, in his blame of a falling church, yet selects for praise one particular in which His mind is yet retained.

It would have been well for the church, had this always been remembered. <b>the works</b>, see below, must be referred to the moral delinquencies of this sect) <b>of the Nicolaitans </b>(there has been much dispute who these were. The prevailing opinion among the fathers was, that they were a sect founded by Nicolaus the proselyte of Antioch, one of the seven deacons. But there early becomes evident a desire to vindicate Nicolaus the deacon from the opprobrium of having been the founder of such a sect; and in consequence we soon find another Nicolaus substituted for the deacon of that name. An apocryphal Acts of the Apostles speaks of a Corinthian of this name, infamous for licentious practices. We come now to the second principal view with regard to this sect, which supposes their name to be symbolic, and Nicolaus to be the Greek rendering of Balaam, and to mean,<i> “He ruined, or absorbed the people.”</i> Consequently the name Nicolaitans is said to be equivalent to Balaamites, as is also inferred from ver. 14. This view seems first to have been broached by Heumann in 1712, and since then has been the prevailing one. But in the first place, the names are by no means parallel; and next, the view derives no support from ver. 14 f., where the followers of Balaam are distinct from the Nicolaitans: see note there. And besides, there is no sort of reason for interpreting the name otherwise than historically. It occurs in a passage indicating simple matters of historical fact, just as the name Antipas does in ver. 13. If we do not gain trustworthy accounts of the sect from elsewhere, why not allow for the gulf which separates the history of the apostolic from that of the post-apostolic period, and be content with what we know of them from these two passages? There is nothing repugnant to verisimilitude in the report mentioned by the Fathers, that Nicolaus fell into impurities; nor need all of those who were chosen to aid the Apostles in distributing alms, have been even to the end of their lives spotless and infallible. At least it may be enough for us to believe that possible of one of them, which the post-apostolic Fathers did not hesitate to receive), <b>which I also hate</b> (this strong expression in the mouth of our Lord unquestionably points at deeds of abomination and impurity: compare Isa. lxi. 8; Jer. xliv. 4; Amos v. 21; Zech. viii. 17).<h2><u><b>7.</u></h2></b> Solemn conclusion of the Epistle. <b>He that hath an ear </b>(no fanciful distinction must be imagined between the singular, and the plural which is found in the Gospels [Matt. xi. 15, xiii. 9, &c.].

It directs attention, not to that which follows only, but to the whole contents of the seven Epistles), <b>To him that conquereth</b> (the verb is absolute, without any object expressed.

The promise, and its expression are in the closest connexion with our Lord’s discourse in John vi., as will be seen by comparing Gen. iii. 22. But we need not therefore say that Christ <i>is </i>the tree of life here, nor confuse the figure by introducing one which in its character is distinct from it. Still less is the tree to be interpreted as being the Holy Spirit. See, for the imagery, ch. xxii. 2, 14, 19. The words <b>of God</b>, as following <i>paradise</i>, come from Ezek. xxviii. 13, and set forth the holiness and glory of that paradise, as consisting in God's dwelling and delighting in it).<h2><u><b>8—11.</u></h2></b> THE EPISTLE TO THE CHURCH AT SMYRNA. <b>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna</b> (in accordance with the idea of the angel representing the bishop, many of the ancient Commentators have inferred that Polycarp must have been here addressed. Whether this were chronologically possible, must depend on the date which we assign to the writing of the Apocalypse. He was martyred in A.D. 168, 86 years after his conversion) <b>write; These things saith the first and the last, which was</b> [became] <b>dead and revived</b> (see ch. i. 17, 18. The words here seem to point on to the promise in verses 10, 11): <b>I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty </b>(in outward wealth, arising probably from the <i>tribulation</i>, by the despoiling of the goods of the Christians); <b>nevertheless thou art rich </b>(spiritually; see 2 Cor. vi. 10, ch. iii. 18, and James ii. 5): <b>and </b>(I know) <b>thy calumny from</b> (arising from) <b>those who profess themselves to be Jews, and they are not, but </b>[<b>are</b>] <b>Satan's synagogue</b> (these slanderers were in all probability actually Jews by birth, but not [see Rom. ii. 28; Matt. iii. 9; John viii. 33; 2 Cor. xi. 22; Phil. iii. 4 ff.] in spiritual reality; the same who every where, in St. Paul’s time and afterwards, were the most active enemies of the Christians. When Polycarp was martyred, we read that “all the multitude of Gentiles and Jews dwelling in Smyrna cried out, enraged with a loud voice:” and afterwards when faggots were collected for the pile, “the Jews most eagerly, as is their wont, giving help.” This view is strengthened by the context. Had they been, as some have supposed, Christians, called <i>Jews </i>in a mystical sense, they would hardly have been spoken of as the principal source of calumny against the Church, nor would the collective epithet of <i>Satan’s synagogue</i> be given to them. Abp. Trench brings out there, how <i>church</i>, the nobler word, was chosen by our Lord and His Apostles for the assembly of the called in Christ, while <i>synagogue</i>, which is only once found [James ii. 2] of a Christian assembly [and there, as Düsterdieck notes, not with <i>of God</i>, but <i>your</i>], was gradually abandoned entirely to the Jews, so that in this, the last book of the canon, such an expression as this can be used.

Whether this may have been owing to the fact of the residence of the supreme magistracy at Pergamus, or to some fanatical zeal of the inhabitants for the worship of Æsculapius, or to some particular person or persons dwelling there especially hostile to the followers of Christ, must remain uncertain.—I may remark, that it is plainly out of the question to attempt, as has been done by some, to connect such an expression as this with the prophecies of the latter portion of the book, and to anticipate for the insignificant Pergamus a leading place in their fulfilment. The expression is relevant, as the context shews, merely to the then existing state of the city, and not to any future part which it should take in the fulfilment of prophecy): <b>and thou holdest fast my name</b> (the profession of thy faith in Me), <b>and didst not deny the faith of me in the days of Antipas ny witness</b> (martyr), <b>my faithful one, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth</b> (of Antipas, the shortened form of Antipater,—after the analogy of Hermas for Hermodorus, Lucas aud Silas for Lucanus and Silvanus,—nothing is known to us with certainty, except from this passage. Andreas (cent. vi.) says that he had read the account of his martyrdom: and Arethas (cent. x.) says, that his “martyrdom” was still extant. Ribera gives an account from Simeon Metaphrastes, that he was bishop of Pergamus, and lived to extreme old age: and that when a persecution arose, in the time of Domitian, after having frequently witnessed a good confession he suffered death by being scorched in a hot brazen bull. The Greek and Roman martyrologies contain similar accounts at his day, April 11th. Respecting the childish symbolic meanings which have been imagined for his name, in defiance of philology and of sobriety alike, see my Greek Test.

We may remark, 1) that it is most according to the sense of the passage to understand these sins in the case of the Nicolaitans, as in that of those whom Balaam tempted, literally, and not mystically : 2) that the whole sense of the passage is against the idea of the identity of the Balaamites and the Nicolaitans : and would be in fact destroyed by it. The mere existence of the etymological relation is extremely doubtful [see above on ver. 6]: and even granting it,—to suppose the two identical, would be to destroy the historical illustration by which the present existing sect is described).<h2><u><b>16.</u></h2> Repent therefore </b>(the command is addressed not only to the Nicolaitans, but to the church, which did not, like that of Ephesus, hate them, but apparently tolerated them) : <b>but if not, I</b> [<b>will</b>] <b>come to thee quickly </b>(here again,—though in the common phrase which expresses the last great day,—not said of the Lord’s final coming ; as indeed the language shews, for then He will no longer <i>“make war”</i>), <b>and will make war with them </b>(the Nieolaitans) <b>with </b>(literally, in, as armed with or arrayed in) <b>the sword. of my mouth</b> (many expositors suppose an allusion to the sword of the angel, armed with which he withstood Balaam in the way [Num. xxii. 23, 31], or to that and the sword by which those who sinned in the matter of Baalpeor [Num. xxv. 5] and eventually Balaam himself [Num. xxxi. 8] were slain: but seeing that the connexion with ch. i. 16 is so plainly asserted by our ver. 12, it seems better to confine the allusion to that sword, and not to stretch it to what after all is a very doubtful analogy).<h2><u><b>17.</u></h2></b> <i>Conclusion</i>. For the former clause see on ver. 7. We may notice that in these three first Epistles, the proclamation precedes the promise to him that conquereth: in the four last, it follows the promise.<b>—To him that conquereth I will give to him </b>(sce above on ver. 7)<b> of the manna which is hidden</b> (in this <b>manna</b>, there is unmistakably an allusion to the proper and heavenly food of the children of Israel, as contrasted with the unhallowed idol-offerings ; but beyond that, there is an allusion again [see above on ver. 7] to our Lord’s discourse in John vi., where He describes Himself as the true bread from heaven: not that we need here, any more than in ver. 7 [see note there], confuse the present figure by literally pressing the symbolism of that chapter. Christ’s gifts may all be summed up in the gift of Himself: on the other hand, He may describe any of the manifold proprieties of his own Person and office as His gift. This manna is <b>hidden</b>, in allusion partly perhaps to the fact of the pot of manna laid up in the ark in the holy of holies (Exod. xvi. 33: compare our ch. xi. 19: not to the Jewish fable, that a pot of manna was hidden by Josiah before the wasting of the temple, and shall again be produced in the time of the Messiah]:—but principally to the fact that our spiritual life, with its springs and nourishments, is hid with Christ in God, Col. iii. 3.

Bede interprets it “the body, now white by baptism, then refulgent with the glory of incorruption.” But this is surely out of the question. Some have connected this with the mention of the manna, and cited the Rabbinical tradition, that with the manna fell precious stones and pearls. Others again think of the precious stones bearing the names of the twelve tribes on the breastplate of the High Priest, the order for which was contemporary with the giving of the manna, Exod. xxviii. 17; xxxix. 10, and regard this as indicating the priestly dignity of the victorious Christian, Ebrard remarks, that as the hidden manna was the reward for abstaining from idol- meat, so this for abstinence from fornication. Again Arethas and others have reminded us of the Gentile custom of presenting the victors at the games with a stone or ticket which entitled them to nourishment at the public expense, and to admission to royal festivals. Hence they regard the white stone as the ticket of admission to the heavenly feast. But it may be replied, 1) the feast is mentioned separately under the name of the hidden manna: and 2) the description of the writing on the stone, which follows, will not suit this view. Again, others, regarding the connexion of the white stone with the manna, refer to the use of the lot cast among the priests, <i>which </i>should offer the sacrifice: or to the writing a name, at election by ballot, on a stone or a bean: or to the custom of <i>absolving </i>criminals with a white stone and condemning them with a black one. Some expositors combine two or more of these expositions.<br><br>But it is against all these interpretations, that no one of them fits the conditions of this description. Each one halts in the explanation either of the stone itself, or of that which is written on it. Least of all, perhaps, does the last apply; the verdict of <i>acquittal </i>would be a strange reward indeed to one who has fought and overcome in the strength of an acquittal long ago obtained, Col. iii. 13. The most probable view is that which Bengel gives a hint of, and which Hengstenberg and Düsterdieck hold, that the figure is derived from the practice of using small stones, inscribed with writing, for various purposes, and that, further than this, the imagery belongs to the occasion itself only. Taking it thus, the colour is that of victory, see ch. iii. 3; vi. 2; iv. 4; xix. 14. The <i>name inscribed</i> yet remains for consideration. It is in this, as it would be in every case, the inscription which gives the stone its real value, being, as it is, a token of reward and approval from the Son of God. But <i>what name</i> is this? not what name <i>in each case</i>, for an answer to this question is precluded by the very terms, “<i>which none,</i> &c.:” but<i> of what kind?</i> Is it the name of Christ Himself, or of God in Christ? This supposition is precluded also by the same terms: for any mysterious name of God or of Christ would either be hidden from all [so ch. xix. 12], or known to all who were similarly victorious through grace. These very terms seem to require that it should be the recipient's <i>own name</i>, a <i>new </i>name however; a revelation of his everlasting title, as a son of God, to glory in Christ, but consisting of, and revealed in, those personal marks and signs of God’s peculiar adoption of <i>himself</i>, which he and none else is acquainted with. “If the heart knoweth its own bitterness, and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy” [Prov. xiv. 10], then the deep secret dealings of God with each of us during those times, by which our sonship is assured and our spiritual strife carried onward to victory, can, when revealed to us in the other blessed state, be known thoroughly to ourselves only).<h2><u><b>18—29.</u></h2></b> THE EPISTLE TO THE CHURCH AT THYATIRA. <b>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God</b> (our Lord thus names Himself here, in accordance with the spirit<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uUe4FSsAEogjqZLBKROK1CFnvAQY0spg/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It could not well have been <i>inserted</i>: and was sure to have been erased, from its difficulty, and possibly from other reasons, considering what was the common interpretation of the <i>angel</i>. It does not create any real difficulty: finding its meaning not in the matter of fact at Thyatira, but in the history from which the appellation <b>Jezebel</b> is taken. In 1 Kings xxi. 25 we read, <i>“Ahab, who did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord : whom Jezebel his wife stirred up:”</i> from which text the phrase is transferred entire, importing that this Jezebel was to the church at Thyatira what that other was to Ahab. It is not so easy to determine who is, or who are, imported by the term. The very fact of the name, Jezebel being chosen [for it is impossible, even were this the actual name of a woman, that it should be used here with any other than the symbolic meaning], coupled with <b>thy wife,</b> as above explained, takes us out of the realms of simple fact into those of symbolism. The figure of “Jezebel thy wife” being once recognized in its historical import, it would not be needful that an individual woman should be found to answer to it: the conscience of the Thyatiran church could not fail to apply the severe reproof to whatever influence was being exerted in the direction here indicated. So that I should rate at very little the speculations of many Commentators on the supposed woman here pointed out. Düsterdieck, recently, remarks that the expression,<b> which calleth herself a prophetess</b>, has something individual about it. So it has: but may not this individuality belong just as well to the figure, as to the thing signified by it? The sect or individuals being once concentrated as <b>Jezebel</b>, this expression would follow of course, in the propriety of the figure. On the whole, however, I should feel it more probable that some individual <i>teacher</i>, high in repute and influence at the time, is pointed at. The denunciation of such a teacher under such a title would be at once startling and decisive. Nor would probability be violated by the other supposition, that a favoured and influential party in the Thyatiran church is designated.

This specification of the mischief done shews us that this influence at Thyatira was in the same direction as the evil works of the Nicolaitans at Pergamus, ver. 14. The fact that this was the prevalent direction of the false teaching of the day, is important in a chronological point of view: see Introduction, § iii. par. 6). <b>And I gave her time</b> (not, “in my pre-ordination of what is to be,” as in Mark xiii. 20, but denoting historically that which the Lord had actually done, in vain.

Otherwise, if taken figuratively, it would be only a repetition of the other particular, idolatry).<h2><u><b>22.</u></h2></b> <b>Behold </b>(arrests attention, and prepares the way for something unexpected and terrible),<b> I cast her</b> (evidently against her will: but there is not necessarily violence in the word: it is the ordinary verb for being “cast” on a bed of sickness: so Matt. viii. 6, 14) <b>into a bed </b>(of sickness, see Ps. xli. 3: will change her bed of whoredom into a bed of anguish. So most Commentators. Perhaps the threat has reference to a future pestilence. Some understand the bed to be future punishment, referring to Isa. xiv. 11), <b>and those who commit adultery </b>(not now <i>fornication</i>, but a more general term, embracing in its wide meaning both the fornication and eating things sacrificed to idols, and well known as the word used of rebellious and idolatrous Israel, Jer. iii. 8, v. 7; Ezek. xvi. 32 &c.) <b>together with her</b> (not those who <i>commit adultery with her,</i> Dut those who, as well as she, commit adultery: those who share with her in her adulteries. These, as interpreted by the tone with which the rebuke began, will mean, those who by suffering and encouraging her, make themselves partakers of her sin, And this rather favours the idea that not one individual, but a dominant party, is intended. See below) <b>into great tribulation</b> (this clause forms a kind of parallelism with the former, so that <i>into great tribulation</i> is parallel with <i>into a bed</i>. But it is not to be regarded as interpreting the bed. Her punishment and that of her children [see below] is one thing; that of the partakers in her adulteries, those in the church who tolerated and encouraged her, another, viz. great tribulation.

But it seems doubtful whether so minute a distinction is in the words; whether they are not rather a general designation for the whole inward part of a man): <b>and I will give to you</b> (‘will render, in My doom of judgment.’ The strain of the Lord’s message is suddenly changed into a direct ad- dress to those threatened) <b>to each according to your works</b> (not the mere outward products of the visible life, but the real acts and verities of the inward man, discerned by the piercing eye of the Son of God).<h2><u><b>24.</u></h2></b> <b>But </b>(contrast to those addressed before) <b>to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not</b> (not only do not <i>hold</i>, but are free from any contact with) <b>this teaching, such as have not known the depths</b> (deep places) <b>of Satan, as they call them </b>(it was the characteristic of the falsely named <i>Gnosis </i>[Knowledge], to boast of its <i>Bathea</i>, or depths, of divine things. Tertullian says, in accusing the Valentinian heretics of dark deeds in secret, that if you ask plain questions about their mysteries, they knit their brows, and answer, “<i>It is</i> <b>deep</b>.” We may safely therefore refer the expression to the heretics spoken of, But it is not so clear to whom, as their subject, the words <b>as they call them</b> are to be appropriated, and again <i>whose </i>words <b>“of Satan”</b> are, whether those 1) of our Lord, 2) of the heretics, or 3) of the Christians addressed. If they belong to the <i>Christians</i>, then the sense will be, that they, the Christians, called the <b>depths </b>of the heretics the depths of <b>Satan</b>, and were content to profess their ignorance of them. So far would be true enough; but the sentence would thus be left very flat and pointless, and altogether inconsistent in its tone with the solemn and pregnant words of the rest of the message. If the words <b>as they call them</b> belong to the <i>heretics</i>, we have our choice between two views of the words <b>of Satan</b>: either 1) that the heretics themselves called their own mysteries <b>the depths of Satan</b>.

This has been the sense taken by most Commentators. And it appears to me that this alone comes in any measure up to the requirements of the passage, in intensity of meaning and solemnity, as well as in likelihood); <b>I cast not upon you any other burden </b>(to what do the words refer? There can, I imagine, be little doubt as to the answer, if we remember some of the expressions used in the apostolic decree in which these very matters here in question, fornication and abstaining from unholy meats, were the only things forbidden to the Gentile converts. For our Lord here takes up aud refers to those very words. In Acts xv. 28 we read, <i>“It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us</i> to lay upon you no greater burden <i>than these necessary things, that ye abstain from meats offered fo idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.</i>” This act of simple obedience, and no deep matters beyond their reach, was what the Lord required of them. And this <i>burden</i> resolved itself into keeping the faith once delivered to the saints, as enjoined in the next sentence. The word has been very variously understood:—of the trouble given them by Jezebel and her followers: —of the punishments about to befall the heretics, which were not to be feared by the Christians:—of the burden of previous suffering implied in the word <b>patience</b> above,—and of the sense of “burden,” so often occurring in the prophets when they denounce the divine threatenings. But to my mind the allusion to the apostolic decree is too clear and prominent to allow of any other meaning coming into question: at least any other which sets that entirely aside. Others may be deduced and flow from that one, which have meaning for the church now that those former subjects of controversy have passed away): <b>but</b> (“<i>only:</i>” i.e., forget not that the licence just accorded involves this sacred obligation) <b>that which ye have</b> (see ch. iii. 11: not to be restricted in its sense to their stedfastness in resisting Jezebel and hers, but representing the sum total of Christian doctrine and hope and privilege; the <i>“faith once for all delivered to the saints”</i> of Jude 3), <b>hold fast</b> (the word in the original sets forth not so much the continuing habit, as the renewed and determined grasp of every intervening moment of the space prescribed) <b>until the time when I shall come</b> (the original gives an uncertainty when the time shall be, which we cannot convey in our language).<h2><u><b>26.</u></h2> And</b> (the announcement of reward to the conqueror <i>now first</i> precedes the proclamation to hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: and is joined, <i>here alone</i>, by “<b>and</b>” to the preceding portion of the Epistle; being indeed more closely connected with it in this case than in any of the others: see below)<b> he that conquereth and he that </b>(by this second designation this second class is precluded from being taken as merely explanatory of the first, and is specified as included in it) <b>keepeth to the end</b> (it is remarkable, that immediately after the words, so pointedly alluded to above, in the apostolic decree, Acts xv. 28, was added, <i>from which if ye </i><b>keep </b><i>yourselves, ye shall do well</i>) <b>my works</b> (contrast to <b>her </b><i>works</i>, ver. 22: but extending beyond that contrast to a general and blessed truth. <b>My </b><i>works</i>, i.e. which belong to Me, are the attributes of Myself and of Mine), <b>I will give to him authority over the nations</b> (compare the words, “<i>Have thou </i><b>authority </b><i>over the cities,</i>” Luke xix. 17, which is the reward of him who obeyed the command, <i>“Occupy</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZl53zGU0aZG8MlQB2V6zROBu-g59BMo/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The saying, as rendered by them, is sanctioned by being thrice quoted in this book, see ch. Xii. 5, xix. 15) <b>them with a rod of iron </b>(a sceptre of severity: ie. of inflexible justice), <b>as the vessels of pottery are broken up</b> (crushed, or shivered: the original gives the idea of the multitudinous fragments collapsing into an heap: the “broken to shivers” of the A.V. is very good), <b>as I also have received from my Father</b> (viz. in Ps. ii. 9, in which Psalm it is said, <i>“Thou art my Son,”</i> ver. 7. The power there conferred on Me, I will delegate to my victorious servant). <b>And I will give to him the star of the morning</b> (it is not easy to say what, in strict exactness, these words import. The interpretations given are very various and inconsistent. The early Expositors, Andreas and Arethas, Understand it of the Lucifer of Isa. xiv. 12, i.e. the devil, whom our Lord saw as lightning fall from heaven.—or, as there imported, the King of Babylon, the most powerful monarch on earth. Another ancient meaning given is the day-star arising in the hearts of the faithful, spoken of by St. Peter, 2 Pet. i. 19. Victorinus (century iv.) says it is <i>the first resurrection.</i> Many others, ancient and modern, understand Christ Himself, who, ch. Xxii. 16, declares Himself to be <i>the bright and morning star:</i> and doubtless, as has been before remarked on the fruit of the tree of life, ver. 7, and on the hidden manna, ver. 17, in the mystical sense, Christ Himself is the sum and inclusion of all Christ’s gifts: this truth serves to connect the symbolism of all these passages, but does not justify us in disturbing that of one by introducing that of another. Here the morning star clearly is not Christ Himself, the very terms of the sentence separating the two. Then again, we have Lyra’s interpretation, the glorious body; Grotius’s, that it is brightness as much exceeding all other, as the morning star excels the other stars. And this interpretation is probably near the mark. In Dan. xii. 3 we read that the righteous shall shine <i>as the stars,</i> and in Matt. xiii. 43 that they <i>shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</i> And in Prov. iv. 18, we read that “the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” Still, this interpretation does not quite satisfy the words <b>I will give him:</b> unless indeed the poetic imagery be, that he is imagined as clad in the glory of that star, putting it on as a jewel, or as a glittering robe. De Wette supposes that the star is to be given to him as its ruler: but such an interpretation would lead into a wide field of speculation which does not seem to have been opened by Scripture, and is hardly required by the passage itself). <h2><u><b>29.</u></h2></b> See above, on ver. 7.<h1><u>CHAP.

We have mention in ch. i. 4 of the seven spirits which are before God's throne: and we there found occasion to interpret them of the plenitude of the Godhead in its attributes and energies. See, for further elucidation, ch. iv. 5, v. 6. These spirits, this plenitude, Christ, the Lord of the Church, possesses, is clothed and invested with, in all fulness. From Him the spiritual life of his churches comes as its source, in all its elements of vitality. He searches all the depths both of our depravity and of His own applications of grace. He has in his hand all the Spirit’s power of conviction. He wields the fire of purification and the fire of destruction. Whether the Spirit informs, or rebukes, or warns, or comforts, or promises, whether He softens or hardens men’s hearts, it is Christ who, searching the hearts as Son of God and feeling their feelings as Son of man, wields and applies the one and manifold Spirit.<br><br>The designation here has its appropriateness in the whole character of this solemn Epistle. The Lord of the Church comes, armed with all the powers of the Spirit; searching the depths of hypocrisy, judging of the worthlessness of works not done in faith. The difficulty of this general attribute of Christ, and not any one selected specially as applying to Sardis being here introduced, seems to be best accounted for, not, as Ebrard, by the general prophetic import of the Epistle, but by the fact that. the minatory strain of the Epistle justities the alleging the whole weight and majesty of the divine character of our Lord, to create alarm and bring about repentance), <b>and the seven stars</b> (the former symbolism [ch i. 16, 20] still holds in all its strictness. Nor have we the least right here, as some do, to suppose that the stars and the spirits are identical. The motive mentioned above would fully account for this designation also: The Lord of all the churches: He who appoints them their ministering angels, and has them, and all that is theirs, in His hand): <b>I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest</b> (I need only mention for warning the childish fancy, that the Bishop of Sardis was named Zosimus or Vitalis (<i>living</i>). The expression explains itself: thou hast a repute that thou livest: art <i>nominally</i>, as we commonly now say, Christian), <b>and </b>(the mere copula carries the contrast far more vividly and pathetically than when it is made rhetorically complete by inserting “yet”) <b>art dead</b> (spiritually dead: void of vitality and fruitfulness: sunk in that deep deadly sleep which, if not broken in upon and roused up, is death itself: so St. Paul, Eph. v. 14). <b>Be</b> (literally, <b>become</b>: because a change is involved: become what thou art not) <b>watchful</b> (we can hardly help in English substituting the adjective for the participle “watching;” thereby losing objective vividness, and getting instead a subjective attribute of character. “Awake and watch” would be, in paraphrase, tantamount to the text), <b>and strengthen the remaining things, which were</b> (the time is transferred to that indicated by the fulfilment of the command: which were, when thou shalt apply thyself to strengthen them) <b>about to die</b> (there is a question whether these <i>remaining matters </i>are to be understood as <i>things</i>, matters in which the Sardian church was not yet totally without spiritual vitality, or as <i>persons</i>, who were not yet passed into the almost universal death-slumber of hypocrisy. The latter view is taken by very many Commentators. And there is nothing in the construction to preclude it. But if I mistake not, there is in the context. For to assume that the <i>persons remaining </i>could be thus described, would surely be to leave no room for those mentioned with so much praise below in ver. 4.<b> Had the things which remain</b> not occurred, we might have well understood <i>“strengthen those that were ready to die,”</i> of confirming those thy weak members who ow account of the general deadness were near losing their spiritual life altogether: but<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNXOlEBjYEiKz3AcIFChZVVPtULNetAt/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

We must therefore take the other view,—“strengthen those thy remaining few graces, which in thy spiritual deadly slumber are not yet quite extinct”): <b>for I have not found thy works complete in the sight of my God </b>(up to the mark and measure of being acceptable to Him: i.e. not wrought in that living faith which alone renders human works acceptable to God, by uniting them to Him on whom the Father looks with perfect approval. Düsterdieck well observes, “The express reference to the absolute rule of all Christian morality is here put the more strongly and strikingly, because this church had <i>among men</i> a name that she lived.” The <b>my </b>binds on the judgment of Him who speaks to that of God). <b>Remember </b>[<b>therefore</b>] <b>how </b>(not subjective, “<i>with</i> what manner of reception,” but objective, “after what sort:” as in Eph. iv. 20; 1 Cor. xv. 11) <b>thou hast received</b> (perfect tense; said of the permanent deposit of doctrine entrusted) <b>and heardest</b> (merely past tense: said of the act of hearing, when it took place), <b>and keep</b> (what thou hast received and heardest: keep, as an abiding habit),<b> and repent</b> (the command is of a quick and decisive act of amendment). <b>If therefore</b> (the <b>therefore </b>is hardly because it is assumed, in the present evil state of the Sardian church, that the exhortation will be in vain: far rather, because repentance is so grievously needed. And it follows on the plain declaration which has been made of that present evil state; coming forcibly and unexpectedly where we should rather have looked for <i>“But if”</i>) <b>thou dost not watch</b> (shalt not have awaked and become watchful, before the time about to be indicated in the threat which is coming),<b> I will come as a thief </b>(these words do not here refer to our Lord’s final coming, but to some signal judgment in which He would overtake the Sardian church. Just as the formula derived from the great truth of the suddenness of His second coming is frequently applied to His final judgment in Jerusalem, so is it to other His partial and special advents to judgment in the case of individuals and churches), <b>and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee. Nevertheless</b> (notwithstanding this state of apathy even to spiritual death) <b>thou hast </b>(belonging to thee as members. Notice as Bengel remarks, that these few had not separated themselves from the church in Sardis, notwithstanding its degraded state) <b>a few names</b> (“men who may be counted by name:” compare Acts i. 15; ch. xi. 13, note. The term would hardly be used except of a limited number) <b>in Sardis, which have not defiled their garments</b> (literally, did not defile: the past tense is from the standing-point of the future day presently introduced, as so commonly when life is looked back on from the great time of retribution. The meaning of the figure [which occurs also in Jude 23] has been variously given. There can be little doubt that the simpler and more general explanation is the right one: viz. who have not sullied the purity of their Christian life by falling into sin): <b>and they shall walk with me in white</b> (the white here is not to be identified with the undefiled garments which they now wear: it is a new and glorious hue of victory: see ch. vi. 11; vii. 9; xix. 8.

An allusion to Zech. iii. 3 ff. is far more obvious. <b>with me</b>, in remarkable accord with our Lord’s prayer in John xvii. 21, “<i>Father, I will that they whom Thou hast given Me, where I am, there they also may be </i><b>with me:</b>” see also Luke xxiii. 43), <b>for they are worthy</b> (the <i>worthiness </i>here is found in the terms of the sentence itself. They have <i>kept their garments undefiled:</i> they of all others then are the persons who should walk in the glorious white robes of heavenly triumph. Exactly thus in ch. xvi. 5, 6, <i>“They shed blood, and thou gavest them blood to drink:</i><b> they are worthy.</b>” To dream of any merit here implied, is not only to miss, but to run counter to the sense of the whole saying and situation. The absence of defilement is only explained by ch. vii. 14, <i>“They washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:”</i> and as Vitringa excellently says, “Un<i>worthiness</i> here marks the proportion and congruency which was between the state of grace in which they had been on earth, and of the glory which the Lord had decreed for them according to the measure of this very law of grace”). <b>He that conquereth, he </b>(the reading “<i>he that conquereth</i> <b>thus</b>,” found in so many MSS., seems to have arisen originally in a very usual confusion of the long and short <i>o</i> in Greek, and then to have been retained, from not being altogether without meaning; “<i>thus</i>,” i.e. as those first mentioned) <b>shall be clad in white garments </b>(the concluding promise takes the hue of what had gone before, and identifies those just spoken of with these victorious ones): <b>and I will not wipe out his name out of the book of life</b> (this again takes its colour from the preceding. Those who have a name that they <i>live</i>, and are dead, are necessarily wiped out from the book of <i>life</i>: only he whose name is a living name, can remain on those pages. Here again the Rabbinical expositors have gone wrong in imagining that the genealogical tables of the priests are alluded to. Far rather is the reference to the ordinary lists of citizens, or of living members of any body or society, from which the dead are struck out. Thus they whose names have been once inscribed in this book, whether by their outward admission into Christ’s church in baptism, or by their becoming living members of Him by faith, if they endure to the end as His soldiers and servants, and obtain the victory, shall not, as all His mere professed members shall, have their names erased from it. The figure itself, of the book of life, is found as early as Exod. xxxii. 32 f.); <b>and I will his name in the presence of my Father and in the presence of his angels </b>(see Matt. x.32; Luke xii. 8, both of which are here combined: see also Luke ix. 26; Mark viii. 38.

In Isa. xxii. 22, it is said of Eliakim son of Hilkiah, <i>“The key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open:”</i> which is manifestly the passage here incorporated into the Lord’s message: and the sense is that whatever inferior degrees there may be of this power of opening and shutting the church [<i>the house of David</i>, with reference to the false Jews below], the supreme power, the one true key, belongs to the Lord Christ alone. It is hardly justified, and serves but little purpose, to attempt to set up a distinction between “the key <i>of David</i>” here, and “the key of <i>the house of David</i>” in Isaiah. The key is the same in both cases: but the One possesses, it as his own by right, the other has it merely entrusted to him; laid on his shoulder. See on the whole sense, Matt. xvi. 19), <b>who openeth, and no one shall shut; and shutteth, and no one shall open</b> (these words are to be taken not merely of the power of Christ to forgive sins, but generally, as indeed the next ver. requires. Christ only has power to admit into and exclude from His kingdom; to enlarge the work and opportunities of His church, and to contract them): <b>I know thy works</b> (these words stand by themselves; not as connected with what follows below, the intervening sentence, “<i>behold, ... shut,</i>” being considered parenthetical.<br><br>They are words of comfort and support to the Philadelphian church):<b> behold, I have given before thee a door opened</b> (i.e. have granted, in my possession and administration of the key of David, that a door should stand opened. The door is variously understood: but most Expositors take it to mean, as in 1 Cor. xvi. 9; 2 Cor. ii. 12; Col. iv. 3 [otherwise in Acts xiv. 27], an opportunity for the mission work of the church. And this appears to be the true sense here, by what follows in ver. 9, promising conversion of those who were now foes.<br><br><b>before thee,</b> because the course is naturally <i>forward</i>), <b>which no one is able to shut: because</b> (gives the reason of what preceded; the Lord will confer this great advantage on the Philadelphian church, <i>because...</i>) <b>thou hast little power</b> (not as A.V. <i>“a little strength,”</i> thereby virtually reversing the sense of the words: the original importing <i>“thy strength is but small,”</i> and the A. V. importing <i>“thou hast some strength,”</i> the fact of its smallness vanishing under the indefinite term <i>“a little.”</i><br><br>This smallness of strength must not be attributed to a scanty bestowal of miraculous powers on the Philadelphian church, but to the fact of the fewness of the congregation of Christians there: possibly <i>also </i>to their poverty as contrasted with the wealth of their Jewish adversaries), <b>and </b>(using that little well) <b>didst keep my word, and didst not deny my name </b>(the past tenses perhaps refer to some time of especial trial when both these temptations, to break Christ’s word and deny His name, were<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-aAZOweJDMYmVLdh2ONMTpzgrRWJx74S/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Düsterdieck takes it as used of that great proof which Christ gave of His love by dying for His church, appealing to the same tense in Eph. v. 25; Gal. ii. 20; 1 John iv. 10, 11. But thus we lose the especial reference to the particular church which seems to be involved in the recognition. It is the love bestowed on the Philadelphian church, in signalizing its success in the work of Christ, that these converted enemies shall recognize). <b>Because thou didst keep the word of my endurance</b> (or, <b>patience</b>: the word preached to thee, enjoining that endurance which belongs to Me and mine, see ch. i. 9), <b>I also</b> (I on my side: the <b>also </b>expressing reciprocity) <b>will keep thee</b> (<b>thee</b>, emphatic and prominent) <b>from </b>(from out of the midst of: but whether by <i>immunity from</i>, or by <i>being brought safe through</i>, the preposition does not clearly define)<b> the hour of temptation</b> (the appointed season of sore trial: literally, <b>of the temptation</b>, of the well-known and signal temptation.

In this great trial, the servants of Christ shall be kept safe, ch. vii. 3.

Thus Grotius understands it of the persecution under Nero; Lyra, of the future increase of that under Domitian, which was raging as the Apostle wrote: others, of those under Trajan: others again, of the troubles which should arise on account of Antichrist, which is nearer the mark).<h2><u><b>11.</u></h2> I come quickly</b> (these words, which in different senses and with varying references<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 2, Part 2, Revelation, Pages 622-754 missing.</h2>
