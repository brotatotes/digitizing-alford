This name came to be applied to the writings themselves which contain this news, very early. Justin Martyr, in the second century speaks of “the memoirs drawn up by the Apostles, which are called gospels (euangelia).”<h3><u><b>according to Matthew</b>]</u></h3> <i>as delivered by</i> Matthew, implies <i>authorship or editorship</i>. It is not merely equivalent to <i>of Matthew</i>, which would have been said, had it been meant. Nor does it signify that the original teaching was Matthew’s and the present gospel drawn up after that teaching. Eusebius tells us, that Matthew “delivered to writing the gospel according to him.”<h1><u><b>CHAP. I. 1–17.</b>]</u></h1> GENEALOGY OF JESUS CHRIST. <h2><u><b>1.</b> <b>book of the generation</b>]</u></h2> Not always used of a pedigree only: see reff. Here however it appears that it refers exclusively to the genealogy, by “<i>Jesus Christ</i>” being used in the enunciation, and the close being “<i>Jesus</i> which is called <i>Christ</i>.’ Then ver. 17 forms a conclusion to it, and ver. 18 passes on to other matter. <h3><u><b>Jesus</b>]</u></h3> See on ver. 21.<h3><u><b>Christ</b>]</u></h3> The word is equivalent to the Hebrew <i>Messiah</i>, <b>anointed</b>. It is used of kings, priests, prophets, and of the promised Deliverer. It is here used (see ver. 16) in that sense in which it became affixed to Jesus as the name of our Lord. It does not once thus occur in the progress of the Evangelic <i>history</i>; only in the prefatory parts of the Gospels, here and vv. 16, 17, 18: Mark i. 1: John i. 17, and once in the mouth of our Lord Himself, John xvii. 3; but continually in the Acts and Epistles. This may serve to shew that the evangelic memoirs themselves were of earlier date than their incorporation into our present Gospels.<h3><u><b>son ... son</b>]</u></h3> both times refers to our Lord. <i>Son of David</i> was an especial title of the Messiah: see reff. That He should be <i>son of Abraham</i>, was too solemn a subject of prophecy to be omitted here, even though implied in the other. These words serve to shew the character of the Gospel, as written <i>for Jews</i>. Luke, ch. iii. 23 ff., carries his geneology farther back.<h2><u><b>2. and his brethren</b>]</u></h2> These additions probably indicate that Matt. did not take his genealogy from any family or public documents, but constructed it himself. <h2><u><b>3.</b>]</u></h2> These children of Judah were not born in marriage: see Gen. xxxviii. 16–30. Both the sons are named, probably as recalling the incident connected with their birth. The reason for the women (Thamar, Rahab, Ruth, and Bathsheba) being mentioned, has been variously assigned: it might be, to meet the objection of the Jews to <i>our Lord’s</i> birth: or <i>for the sake of minute accuracy</i>.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kAZ62IkvEX4smgOwKAir10L3ArE5bJI/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 69:</a></h3><br>It most probably is, that the Evangelist omitted what was ordinary, but stated what was doubtful or singular. It has been suggested, that as these women are of Gentile origin or dubious character, they may be mentioned as introducing the calling of Gentiles and sinners by our Lord: also, that they may serve as types of the mother of our Lord, and are consequently named in the course of the genealogy, as she is at the end of it.<h2><u><b>5. Rachab</b>]</u></h2> It has been imagined, on chronological grounds, that this Rachab must be a different person from Rahab of Jericho. But those very grounds completely tally with their identity. For Naashon father of Salmon), prince of Judah (1 Chron. ii. 10), offered his offering at the setting up of the tabernacle (Num. vii. 12) 39 years before the taking of Jericho. So that Salmon would be of mature age at or soon after that event; at which time Rahab was probably young, as her father and mother were living (Josh. vi. 23). Nor is it any objection that Achan, the fourth in descent from Judah by Zara, is contemporary with Salmon, the sixth of the other branch: since the generations in the line of Zara average 69 years, and those in the line of Phares 49, both within the limits of probability. The difficulty of the interval of 366 years between Rahab and David does not to this passage only, but equally to Ruth iv. 21, 22; and is by no means insuperable, especially when the extreme old age of Jesse, implied in 1 Sam. xvii. 12, is considered.—I may add that, considering Rahab’s father and mother were alive, the house would hardly be called <i>the house Of Rahab</i> except on account of the character commonly assigned to her.<h2><u><b>8. Joram ... Ozias</b>]</u></h2> Three kings, viz. Ahaziah, Joash, Amaziah (1 Chron. iii. 11, 12), are here omitted. Some think that they were erased on account of their connexion, by means of Athaliah, with the accursed house of Ahab. Simeon is omitted by Moses in blessing the tribes (Deut. xxxiii.): the descendants of Zebulun and Dan are over in 1 Chron., and none of the latter tribe are sealed in Rev. vii. But more probably such erasion, even if justifiable by that reason, was not made on account of it, but for convenience, in order to square the numbers of the different portions of the genealogies, as here. Compare, as illustrating such omissions, 1 Chron. viii. 1 with Gen. xlvi. 21.<h2><u><b>11. Josias . . . Jechonias</b>]</u></h2> Eliakim, son of Josiah and father of Jechonias, is omitted ; which was objected to the Christians by Porphyry. The reading which inserts Joacim (i.e. Eliakim) rests on hardly any foundation, and would make fifteen generations in the second “<i>fourteen.</i>” The solution of the difficulty by supposing the name to apply to both Eliakim and his son, and to mean the former in ver. 11 and the latter in ver. 12, is unsupported by example, and contrary to the usage of the genealogy. When we notice that the <i>brethren </i>of Jechonias are his <i>uncles</i>, and find this way of speaking sanctioned by 2 Chron. xxxvi. 10, where Zedekiah, one of these, is called his brother, we are led to seek our solution in some manner of speaking of these kings, by which Eliakim and his son were not accounted two distinct generations. If we compare 1 Chron. iii. 16 with 2 Kings<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_BKuwTsR2yN9sCJjniNyRbo-tD2B5su-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In the latter passage, where we have “his father’s brother,” the LXX render “his son.” <h2><u><b>12. Jechonias .. .. Salathiel</b>]</u></h2> So also the genealogy in 1 Chron. iii. 17. When, therefore, it is denounced (Jer. xxii. 30) that Jechoniah should be ‘childless,’ this word must be understood as explained by the rest of the verse, ‘for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David and ruling any more in Judah.’ <h3><u><b>Salathiel ... Zorobabel</b>]</u></h3> There is no difficulty here which does not also exist in the O. T. Zerubbabel is there usually called the son of Shealtiel (Salathiel). Ezra iii. 2, &c. Neh. xii. 1, &c. Hag. i.1, &c In 1 Chron. iii, 19, Zerubbabel is said to have been the son of Pedaiah, brother of Salathiel. Either this may have been a different Zerubbabel, or Salathiel may, according to the law, have raised up seed to his brother.<h2><u><b>18. Zorobabel ..... Abiud</b>]</u></h2> Abiud is not mentioned as a son of the Zerubbabel in 1 Chron. iii—Lord A. Hervey, On the Genealogies of our Lord, p. 122 ff., has made it probable that Abiud is identical with the Hodaiah of 1 Chron. iii. 24, and the Juda of Luke iii. 26–On the comparison of this genealogy with that given in Luke, see notes, Luke iii. 23-38.<h2><u><b>17. fourteen generations</b>]</u></h2> If we carefully observe Matthew’s arrangement, we shall have no difficulty in completing the three “<i>fourteens</i>.” For the first is from Abraham to David, of course inclusive. The second from David (again inclusive) to the <i>migration</i>; which gives no name, as before, to be included in both the second and third periods, but which is mentioned simultaneously with the begetting of Jechonias, leaving him for the third period. This last, then, takes in from Jechonias to JESUS CHRIST inclusive. So that the three stand thus, according to the words of this verse: (1) from Abraham to David. (2) From David to the migration to Babylon, i.e. about the time when Josiah begat Jechonias. (3) From the migration (i.e. from Jechonias) to Christ.<h2><u><b>18–25.</b>]</u></h2> CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS BIRTH.<h2><u><b>18. espoused</b>]</u></h2> i.e. betrothed. The interval between betrothal and the consummation of marriage was sometimes considerable, during which the betrothed remained in her father’s house, till the bridegroom came and fetched her. See Deut. xx. 7 <h3><u><b>came together</b>]</u></h3> Here to be understood of living together in one house as man and wife. Chrysostom well suggests, that the conception was not allowed to take place before the betrothal, both that the matter might take place more in privacy, and that the Blessed Virgin might escape slanderous suspicion.<h3><u><b>was found</b>]</u></h3> not merely for <i>was</i>, as some have said, but in its proper meaning:— <b>she was discovered to be</b>, no matter by whom. The words “of (by) the Holy Ghost,” are the addition of the Evangelist declaring the matter of fact, and do not<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jfUI4ricWusHkHMTAL0npHCp00WWaTSo/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Deut. xxii. 24. <h3><u><b>just</b>]</u></h3><b> “and not willing”</b> is, not the explanation of <b>just</b>, but an additional particular. He was a strict observer of the law,—and (yet) not willing to expose her. The sense of ‘<i>kind</i>,’ ‘<i>merciful</i>,’ proposed by some instead of <b>just</b>, is inadmissible.<h3><u><b>privily</b>]</u></h3> Not ‘<i>without any writing of divorcement</i>,’ which would have been unlawful; but according to the form prescribed in Deut. xxiv. 1. The husband might either do this, or adopt the stronger course of bringing his wife to justice openly. The punishment in this case would have been death by stoning. Deut. xxii. 23.<h2><u><b>20. behold</b>]</u></h2> answers to the Hebrew “hinneh,” and is frequently used by Matt. and Luke to introduce a new event or change of scene: not so often by Mark, and never with this view in John.<h3><u><b>an angel</b>]</u></h3> The announcement was made to Mary openly, but to Joseph in a dream; for in Mary’s case faith and concurrence of will were necessary—the communication was of a higher kind,—and referred to a thing future; but here it is simply an advertisement for caution’s sake of an event which had already happened, and is altogether a communication of an inferior order: see Gen. xx. 3. But see on the other hand the remarks at the close of the notes on ver. 21. <h3><u><b>son of David</b>]</u></h3> These words would recall Joseph’s mind to the promised seed, the expectation of the families of the lineage of David, and at once stamp the message as the announcement of the birth of the Messiah. May it not likewise be said, that this appellation would come with more force, if Mary also were <i>a daughter</i> of David? The addition, “<b>thy wife</b>,” serves to remind Joseph of that relation which she already held by betrothal, and which he was now exhorted to recognize. See above on ver. 19.<h2><u><b>21. Jesus</b>]</u></h2> The same name as Joshua, the former deliverer of Israel. Philo says, “Jesus is, being interpreted, ‘The salvation of the Lord.’” <h3><u><b>He</b>]</u></h3> emphatically: <b>He alone</b>: best rendered, perhaps, ‘<i>it is He that</i>.’ <h3><u><b>his people</b>]</u></h3> In primary sense, <i>the Jews</i>, of whom alone Joseph could have understood the words: but in the larger sense, all who believe on Him: an explanation which the tenor of prophecy (cf. Gen. xxii. 18: Deut. xxxii. 21), and the subsequent admission of the Gentiles, warrant. Cf. a similar use of ‘Israel’ by St. Peter, Acts v.31. <h3><u><b>from their sins</b>]</u></h3> It is remarkable that in this early part of the evangelic history, in the midst of pedigrees, and the disturbances of thrones by the supposed temporal King of the Jews, we have so clear an indication of the <i>spiritual nature of the office of Christ</i>. One circumstance of this kind outweighs a thousand cavils against the historical reality of the narration. If I mistake not, this announcement reaches further into the deliverance to be wrought, by Jesus, than any thing mentioned by the Evangelist subsequently. It thus bears the internal impress of a message from God, treasured up and related in its original formal terms.—“Sins” is not put for the <i>punishment of sin</i>, but is the sin itself—<b> the practice of sin</b>, in its most pregnant sense. ‘How suggestive it is,’ remarks Bishop Ellicott, ‘that while to the loftier spirit of Mary the name of Jesus is revealed with all the prophetic associations of more than David’s glories—to Joseph, perchance the aged Joseph, who might have long seen and realized his own spiritual needs, and the needs of those around him, it is specially said, thou shalt call his name Jesus: <i>for He shall save his people from their sins.</i>’ Historical Lectures on the Life of our Lord, p. 56. <h2><u><b>22. that it might be fulfilled</b>]</u></h2> It is impossible to interpret that in any other sense than<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G3Cig3vXSNbHnBACrQ6-d1VuSRPw6a3j/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 72:</a></h3><br><b>in order that</b>. The words “all this was done,” and the uniform usage of the N.T., forbid any other. Nor, if rightly viewed, does the passage require any other. Whatever may have been the partial fulfilment of the prophecy in the time of Ahaz, its reference to a different time, and a higher deliverance, is undeniable: and then, whatever causes contributed to bring about all this, might be all summed up in the fulfilment of the divine purpose, of which that prophecy was the declaration. The accomplishment of a promise formally made is often alleged as the cause of an action extending wider than the promise, and purposed long before its utterance. And of course these remarks apply to every passage where the phrase is used. Such a construction can have but one meaning. If such meaning involve us in difficulty regarding the prophecy itself, far better leave such difficulty, in so doubtful a matter as the interpretation of prophecy, unsolved, than create one in so simple a matter as the rendering of a phrase whose meaning no indifferent person could doubt. The immediate and literal fulfilment of the prophecy seems to be related in Isa. viii. 1–4. Yet there the child was <i>not </i>called Emmanuel: but in ver. 8 that name is used as applying to one of far greater dignity. Again, Isa. ix. 6 seems to be a reference to this prophecy, as also Micah v. 3.<h2><u><b>23. the virgin</b>]</u></h2> the words are from the Septuagint. Such is the rendering of the LXX. The Hebrew word is the more general term, “<i>the young woman</i>,” and is so translated by Aquila. <h3><u><b>they shall call</b>]</u></h3> This indefinite plural is surely not without meaning here. <b>Men shall call</b>—i.e. it shall be a name by which He shall be called —one of his appellations. The change of person seems to shew, both that the prophecy had a literal fulfilment at the time, and that it is here quoted in a form suited to its greater and final fulfilment. The<br><br>Hebrew has, ‘<i>thou shalt call</i>’ (fem.).<h3><u><b>Emmanuel</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>God (is) with us</b>. In Isaiah, prophetic primarily of deliverance from the then impending war; but also of final and glorious deliverance by the manifestation of God in the flesh.<h2><u><b>25.</b>]</u></h2> With regard to the much-controverted sense of this verse we may observe, (1) That the primâ facie impression on the reader certainly is, that <b>knew her not</b> was confined to the period of time here mentioned. (2) That there is nothing in Scripture tending to remove this impression, either (a) by narration,—and the very use of the term, “<i>brethren of the Lord</i>” (on which see note at ch. xiii. 55), without qualification, shews that the idea was not repulsive: or (b) by implication,—for every where in the N. T. marriage is spoken of in high and honourable terms; and the words of the angel to Joseph rather imply, than discountenance, such a supposition. (3) On the other hand, the words of this verse do not <i>require </i>it: the idiom being justified on the contrary hypothesis. See my Greek Test. On the whole it seems to me, that <i>no one would ever have thought of interpreting the verse any otherwise than in its primâ facie meaning, except to force it into accordance with a preconceived notion of the perpetual virginity of Mary</i>. It is characteristic, and historically instructive, that the great impugner of the view given above should be Jerome, the impugner of marriage itself: and that his opponents in its interpretation should have been branded as heretics by after ages.

Another name for our Bethlehem was Ephrath; Gen. xxxv. 19; xlviii. 7; or Ephrata, Micah v. 2. It was six Roman miles to the south of Jerusalem, and was known as ‘the city of David,’ the origin of his family, Ruth i. 1, 19.<h3><u><b>in the days of Herod</b>]</u></h3> HEROD THE GREAT, son of Antipater, an Idumæan, by an Arabian mother, made king of Judæa on occasion of his having fled to Rome, being driven from his tetrarchy by the pretender Antigonus. This title was confirmed to him after the battle of Actium by Octavianus. He sought to strengthen his throne by a series of cruelties and slaughters, putting to death even his wife Mariamne, and his sons Alexander and Aristobulus. His cruelties, and his affectation of Gentile customs, gained for him a hatred among the Jews, which neither his magnificent rebuilding of the temple, nor his liberality in other public works, nor his provident care of the people during a severe famine, could mitigate. He died miserably, five days after he had put to death his son Antipater, in the seventieth year of his age, the thirty-eighth of his reign, and the 750th year of Rome. The events here related took place a short time before his death, but necessarily more than forty days; for he spent the last forty days of his life at Jericho and the baths of Callirrhoe, and therefore would not be found by the magi at Jerusalem. The history of Herod’s reign is contained in Josephus, Antt. books xiv. — xvii.<br><br>It would be useless to detail all the conjectures to which this history has given rise. From what has been written on the subject it would appear, (1) That <b>the East</b> may mean either <i>Arabia, Persia,</i> <i>Chald</i>æ<i>a, or Parthia, with the provinces adjacent</i>. See Judges vi. 3: Isa. xli. 2; xlvi. 11: Num. xxiii. 7. Philo speaks of “the Eastern nations and their leaders the Parthians.” In all these countries there were <b>magi</b>, at least persons who in the wider sense of the word were now known by the name. The words in ver. 2 seem to point to some land not very near Judæa, as also the result of Herod’s enquiry as to the date, shewn in “two years old.” (2) If we place together (<i>a</i>) the prophecy in Num. xxiv. 17, which could hardly be unknown to the Eastern astrologers, —and (<i>b</i>) the assertion of Suetonius “that there prevailed an ancient and consistent opinion in all the East, that it was fated that at that time those should go forth from Judæa who should rule the empire:”—and of Tacitus, to the same effect and nearly in the same words,—and (<i>c</i>) the prophecy, also likely to be known in the East, of the seventy weeks in Daniel ix. 24;—we can, I think, be at no loss to understand how any remarkable celestial appearance at this time should have been interpreted as it was. (3) There is no ground for supposing the magi to have been <i>three</i> in number (as first, apparently, by Leo the Great, A.D. 450); or to have been <i>kings</i>. The <i>first</i> tradition appears to have arisen from the number of their gifts: the <i>second</i>, from the prophecy in Isa. lx. 3. Tertullian seems to deduce it from the similar prophecy in Ps. lxxii. 10, for, he says, the Magi were most commonly kings in the East.<h2><u><b>2. his star</b>]</u></h2> There is a question, whether this expression of the magi, <b>we have seen his star</b>, <i>points to any miraculous appearance</i>, or to something observed in the course of their watching the heavens. <i>We know the magi to have been devoted to astrology</i>: and on comparing the language of our text with this undoubted fact, I confess that it appears to me the most ingenuous way, fairly to take account of that fact in our exegesis, and <i>not to shelter ourselves from an apparent difficulty by the hypothesis of a miracle</i>. Wherever supernatural agency is asserted, or may be reasonably inferred, I shall ever be found foremost to insist on its recognition, and impugn every device of rationalism or semi-rationalism; but it does not therefore follow that I should consent to attempts, however well meant, <i>to introduce miraculous interference where it does not appear to be borne out by the narrative</i>. The principle on which this commentary is conducted, is that of <i>honestly endeavouring to ascertain the sense of the sacred text, without regard to any preconceived systems, and fearless of any possible consequences</i>. And if the scientific or historical researches of others seem to contribute to this, my readers will find them, as far as they have fallen within my observation, made use of for that purpose. It seems to me that the preliminary question for us is, Have we here in the sacred text a miracle, or have we some natural appearancé which God in His Providence used as a means of indicating to the magi the birth of His Son?<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QdaTQfzJbp7I2BEuFyW_uMla010HBJh3/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 74:</a></h3><br>Different minds may feel differently as to the answer to this question. And, seeing that much has been said and written on this note in no friendly spirit, I submit that it is not for any man to charge another, who is as firm a believer in the facts related in the sacred text as he himself can be, with weakening that belief, because he feels an honest conviction that it is here relating, not a miracle, but a natural appearance. It is, of course, the far <i>safer</i> way, as far as reputation is concerned, to introduce miraculous agency wherever possible: but the present Editor aims at truth, not popularity.<br><br>Now we learn from astronomical calculations, that a remarkable conjunction of the planets of our system took place a short time before the birth of our Lord. In the year of Rome 747, on the 29th of May, there was a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the 20th degree of the constellation Pisces, close to the first point of Aries, which was the part of the heavens noted in astrological science as that in which the signs denoted the greatest and most noble events. On the 29th of September, in the same year, another conjunction of the same planets took place, in the 16th of Pisces: and on the 5th of December, a third, in the 15th degree of the same sign. Supposing the magi to have seen the <i>first</i> of these conjunctions, they saw it actually <b>in the East</b>; for on the 29th of May <i>it would rise</i> 3½ hours before sunrise. If they then took their journey, and arrived at Jerusalem in 2 little more than <i>five</i> months (the journey from Babylon took Ezra <i>four</i> months, see Ezra vii. 9), if they performed the route from Jerusalem to Bethlehem in the evening, as is implied, the <i>December conjunction</i>, in 15° of Pisces, would be before them <i>in the direction of Bethlehem</i>, 1½ hour east of the meridian at sunset. These circumstances would seem to form a remarkable coincidence with the history in our text. are in no way inconsistent with the word <b>star</b>, which cannot surely (see below) be pressed to its mere literal sense of one single star, but understood in its wider astrological meaning: nor is this explanation of <i>the star directing them to Bethlehem</i> at all repugnant to the plain words of vv. 9, 10, importing its motion from S.E. towards S.W., the direction of Bethlehem. We may further observe, that <i>no part of the text respecting the star, asserts, or even implies, a miracle</i>; and that the very slight apparent inconsistencies with the above explanation are no more than the <i>report of the magi</i> themselves, and the <i>general belief of the age</i> would render unavoidable. If this <i>subservience of the superstitions of astrology to the Divine purposes</i> be objected to, we may answer with Wetstein, “We must infer therefore that these men came to their conclusion from the rules of their art: which though beyond all doubt futile, vain, and delusive, might yet be sometimes permitted to hit on a right result. Hence appears the wonderful wisdom of God, who used the wickedness of men to bring Joseph into Egypt,—who sent the King of Babylon against the Jews by auguries and divinations (Ezek. xxi. 21, 22), and in this instance directed the magi to Christ by astrology.”<br><br>It may be remarked that Abarbanel the Jew, who knew nothing of <i>this</i> conjunction, relates it as a tradition, that no conjunction could be of mightier import than that of Jupiter and Saturn, which planets were in conjunction A.M. 2365, before the birth of Moses, in the sign of Pisces; and thence remarks that that sign was the most significant one for <i>the Jews</i>. From this consideration he concludes that the conjunction of these planets in that sign, in his own time (A.D. 1463), betokened the near approach of the birth of the Messiah. And as the Jews did not invent astrology, but learnt it from the Chaldæans, this idea, that a conjunction in Pisces betokened some great event in Judæa, must have prevailed among Chaldæan astrologers.<br><br>It is fair to notice the influence on the position maintained in this note of the fact which seems to have been substantiated, that the planets did not, during the year B.C. 7, approach each other so as to be mistaken by any eye for one star: indeed not “within double the apparent diameter of the moon.” I submit, that even if this were so, the inference in the note remains as it was. The <i>conjunction of the two planets</i>, complete or incomplete, would be that which would bear astrological significance, not their looking like one star. The two bright planets seen in the east,—the two bright planets standing over Bethlehem,—these would on each occasion have arrested the attention of the magi; and this appearance would have been denominated by them <b>his star</b>.<h3><u><b>in the east</b>]</u></h3> i.e. either in the <i>Eastern country from which they came, </i>or in the<i> Eastern quarter of the heavens.</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M6ZRrS0C0NqXnJl0aMHw4M19CFVzBFD6/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

There may also be a trace of the popular notion that the times of the Messiah would be ushered in by great tribulations.<h2><u><b>4. when he had gathered</b>]</u></h2> i.e. says Lightfoot, he <i>assembled the Sanhedrim</i>.

It must be remembered that though the words are the answer of the Sanhedrim to Herod, and not a citation of the prophet by the Evangelist, yet they are by the latter as correct.<h3><u><b>princes</b>]</u></h3> or <b>thousands (LXX)</b>. The tribes were divided into thousands, and the names of the thousands inscribed in the public records of their respective cities. In Judges vi. 15 Gideon says “Behold my thousand is weak in Manasseh” (see English version, margin), on which Rabbi Kimchi annotates, “Some understand Alphi to mean ‘my father,’ as if it were Alluph, whose signification is ‘prince or lord.’” And thus, it appears, did the Sanhedrim understand the word (which is the same) in Micah v. 2. The word, without points, may mean either “<i>among the thousands,</i>” or “<i>among the princes.</i>”<h3><u><b>out of thee shall come</b>]</u></h3> It has been remarked that the singular expression, which occurs both in Tacitus and Suetonius (see above), “<i>there should go forth from Judea,</i>” may have been derived from these words of the LXX.<h2><u><b>9.</b>]</u></h2><b> stood over</b> may mean ‘<i>over that part of Bethlehem where the young child was,</i>’ which they might have ascertained by enquiry. Or it may even mean, ‘<i>over the whole town of Bethlehem.’</i> If it is to be understood as standing <i>over the house</i>, and thus <i>indicating </i>to the magi the <i>position of the object of their search</i>, the whole incident must be regarded as miraculous, But this<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O--lanXVDcoufS8MmtVELN1cwkBI8Nv4/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In the parallel account as regarded the shepherds, in Luke ii. 16, he is mentioned. I would rather regard the omission here as indicating a <i>simple matter of fact</i>, and contributing to shew the truthfulness of the narrative:—that Joseph <i>happened not to be present</i> at the time. If the meaning of <i>the house</i> is to be pressed (as in a matter of detail I think it should), it will confirm the idea that Joseph and Mary, probably under the idea that the child was to be brought up at Bethlehem, <i>dwelt there some time</i> after the Nativity. Epiphanius, supposes that Mary was at this time on a visit to her Kindred at Bethlehem (possibly at a Passover) as much as two years after our Lord’s birth. But if Mary had kindred at Bethlehem, how could she be so ill-provided with lodging, and have (as is implied in Luke ii. 7) sought accommodation at an inn? And the supposition of two years having elapsed, derived probably from the “<i>two years old</i>” of ver. 16, will involve us in considerable difficulty. There seems to be no reason why the magi may not have come within the forty days before the Purification, which itself may have taken place in the interval between their departure and Herod’s discovery that they had mocked him. No objection can be raised to this view from the “two years old” of ver. 16: see note there. The general idea is, that the Purification was <i>previous </i>to the visit of the magi. Being persuaded of the historic reality of these narratives of Matt. and Luke, we shall find no difficulty in also believing that, <i>were we acquainted with all the events as they happened, their reconcilement would be an easy matter</i> ; whereas now the two independent accounts, from not being aware of, seem to exclude one another. This will often be the case in ordinary life; e.g. in the giving of evidence. And nothing can more satisfactorily shew the veracity and independence of the narrators, where their testimony to the main facts, as in the t case, is consentient.<h3><u><b>treasures</b>]</u></h3> <i>chests </i>or <i>bales</i>, in which the gifts were carried during their journey. The ancient Fathers were fond of tracing in the gifts symbolical meanings: “as to the king, the gold: as to one who was to die, the myrrh: as to a god, the frankincense.” Origen, against Celsus; and similarly Irenæus. We cannot conclude from these gifts that the magi came from <i>Arabia</i>,—as they were common to all the East. Strabo says that the best frankincense comes from the borders of Persia.<h2><u><b>13–23.</b>]</u></h2> FLIGHT INTO EGYPT.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDO9cK5k-bwdse12-FVA9_NLgunseSqg/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

He must be understood, on account of “<i>by night</i>” below, as having arisen the same night and departed forthwith. Egypt, as <i>near</i>, as <i>a Roman province and independent of Herod</i>, and <i>much inhabited by Jews</i>, was an easy and convenient refuge.<h2><u><b>15. Out of Egypt</b>]</u></h2> This citation shews the almost universal application in the N.T. of the prophetic writings to the expected Messiah, as the general antitype of all the events of the typical dispensation. We shall have occasion to remark the same again and again in the course of the Gospels. It seems to have been a received axiom of interpretation (which has, by its adoption in the N. T., received the sanction of the Holy Spirit Himself, and now stands for our guidance), that the subject of all allusions, the represented in all parables and dark sayings, was He who was to come, or the circumstances attendant on His advent and reign.—The words are written in Hosea <i>of the children of Israel</i>, and are rendered from the Hebrew. —A similar expression with regard to Israel is found in Exod. iv. 22, 23.<br><br><b>that it might be fulfilled</b> must not be ex- plained away: it never denotes the event or mere result, but always the <i>purpose</i>.<h2><u><b>16.</b>]</u></h2> Josephus makes no mention of this slaughter; nor is it likely that he would have done. Probably no great number of children perished in so small a place as Bethlehem and its neighbourhood. The modern objections to this narrative may be answered best by remembering the monstrous character of this tyrant, of whom Josephus asserts, “a dark choler seized on him, maddening him against all.’ Herod had marked the way to his throne, and his reign itself, with blood; had murdered his wife and three sons (the last just about this time); and was likely enough, in blind fury, to have made no enquiries, but given the savage order at once.—Besides, there might have been a reason for not making enquiry, but rather taking the course he did, which was sure, as he thought, to answer the end, without divulging the purpose. The word “<i>privily</i>” in ver. 7 seems to favour this view.<h3><u><b>was mocked</b>]</u></h3> The Evangelist is speaking of Herod’s view of the matter.<h3><u><b>the borders thereof</b>]</u></h3> The word <i>coasts </i>is the common rendering of the Greek <i>horia</i> in the A.V. It does not imply any bordering on a sea shore, but is an old use for <i>parts, or neighbourhood</i>, as côte in French. See margin of A.V.<br><br><b>the borders thereof</b> will betoken the insulated houses, and hamlets, which belonged to the territory of Bethlehem.<h3><u><b>from two years old</b>]</u></h3> This expression must not be taken as any very certain indication of the time when the star did actually appear. The addition <b>and under</b> implies that there was uncertainty in Herod’s mind as to the age pointed out; and if so, why might not the jealous tyrant, although he had accurately ascertained the date of the star’s appearing, have taken a range of time extending before as well as after it, the more surely to attain his point?<h2><u><b>17. that which was spoken by Jeremy</b>]</u></h2> Apparently, an accommodation of the prophecy in Jer. xxxi. 15, which was originally written of the Babylonish captivity. We must not draw any fanciful distinction between “<b>then was fulfilled</b>” and “that might be fulfilled,” but rather seek our explanation in the acknowledged system of prophetic interpretation among the Jews, still extant in their rabbinical books, and now sanctioned to us by N.T. usage; at the same time remembering, for our caution, how little even now we understand of the full bearing of prophetic and typical words and acts. None of the expressions of this prophecy must be closely and literally pressed. The link of connexion seems to be <i>Rachel's sepulchre</i>, which (Gen. xxxv. 19: see also<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2f_IJ_JGZO_2kdKgwwB0o8hNs2k5_or/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

We must also take into account the close relation between the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, which had long subsisted. Ramah was six miles to the <i>north </i>of Jerusalem, in the tribe of Benjamin (Jer. xl. 1: “Er-Ram, marked by the village and green patch on its summit, the most conspicuous object from a distance in the approach to Jerusalem from the South, is certainly ‘Ramah of Benjamin.’” Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 213; so that neither must this part of the prophecy be strictly taken.<h2><u><b>20. for they are dead</b>]</u></h2> The plural here is not merely idiomatic, nor for lenity and forbearance, in speaking of the dead; but perhaps a citation from Exod. iv. 19, where the same words are spoken to Moses, or betokens, not the number, but the category. Herod the Great died of a dreadful disease at Jericho, in the seventieth year of his age, and the thirty-eighth of his reign, A.U.C. 750.<h2><u><b>22.</b>]</u></h2> ARCHELAUS was the son of Herod by Malthace, a Samaritan woman: he was brought up at Rome; succeeded his father, but never had the title of king, only that of Ethnarch, with the government of Idumæa, Judæa, and Samaria, the rest of his father’s dominions being divided between his brothers Philip and Antipas. But, (1) very likely the word <i>reign </i>is here used in the wider meaning :—(2) Archelaus did, in the beginning of his reign, give out and regard himself as king: (3) in ch. xiv. 9, Herod the Tetrarch is called <i>the King</i>.— In the ninth year of his government Archelaus was dethroned, for having governed cruelly the Jews and Samaritans, who sent an embassy to Rome against him, and he was banished to Vienne, in Gaul. This account gives rise to some difficulty as compared with St. Luke’s history. It would certainly, on a first view, appear that this Evangelist was not aware that Nazareth had been before this the abode of Joseph and Mary. And it is no real objection to this, that he elsewhere calls Nazareth “<i>His country,</i>” ch. xiii. 54,57. It is perhaps just possible that St. Matthew, writing for Jews, although well aware of the previous circumstances, may not have given them a place in his history, but made the birth at Bethlehem the prominent point, seeing that his account begins at the birth (ch. i. 18), and does not localize what took place before it, which is merely inserted as subservient to that great leading event. If this view be correct, all we could expect is, that his narrative would contain <i>nothing inconsistent</i> with the facts related in Luke; which we find to be the case.—I should prefer, however, believing, as more consistent with the fair and conscientious interpretation of our text, that St. Matthew himself was not aware of the events related in Luke i. ii., and wrote under the impression that Bethlehem was the original dwelling-place of Joseph and Mary. Certainly, <i>had we only his Gospel</i>, this inference from it would universally be made.<br><br><b>turned aside</b> must not be pressed into the service of reconciling the two accounts by being rendered ‘<i>returned;</i>’ for the same is used (ver. 14) of the journey to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGGbVkzCubRLGnaO6VWn5ULiG-z9GAFX/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In searching for such sense, the following hypotheses have been made—none of them satisfactory:— (1) Euthymius says, “Do not enquire what prophets said this: for you will not find out: because many of the prophetic books have perished, some in the captivities, some by neglect of the Jews, some also by foul play.” So also Chrysostom and others. Bar the expression “<i>by the prophets</i>” seems to have a wider bearing than is thus implied. (2) Others say, the general sense of the prophets is, that Christ should be a <i>despised person, as the inhabitants of Nazareth were</i> (John i. 47). But surely this part of the Messiah’s prophetic character is not general or prominent enough, in the absence of any direct verbal connexion with the word in our text, to found such an interpretation on: nor, on the other hand, does it appear that an inhabitant of Nazareth, as such, was despised; only that the obscurity of the town was, both by Nathanael and the Jews, contrasted with our Lord’s claims. (3) The <i>Nazarites </i>of old were men holy and consecrated to God; e.g. Samson (Judg. xiii. 5), Samuel (1 Sam. i. 11), and to this the words are referred by Tertullian, Jerome, and others. But (<i>a</i>) our Lord did not (like John the Baptist) lead a life in accordance with the Nazarite vow, but drank wine, &c., and set himself in marked contrast with John in this very particular (ch. xi. 18, 19); and (b) the word here is not <i>Nazarite</i>, but <i>Nazarene</i>, denoting an inhabitant of Nazareth. (4) There may be an allusion to the Hebrew “<i>Netser,</i>” a branch, by which name our Lord is called in Isa. xi. 1, and from which word it appears that the name Nazareth is probably derived. So “<i>learned Hebrews</i>” mentioned by Jerome on Isa. xi. 1, and others. But this word is only used in the place cited; and in by far the more precise prophecies of the Branch, Zech. iii. 8; vi. 12: Jer. xxiii. 5; xxxiii. 15, and Isa. iv. 2, the word “<i>Tsemach</i>” is used.—I leave it, therefore, as an unsolved difficulty.<h1><u><b>CHAP. III. 1–12.</b>]</u></h1> PREACHING AND BAPTISM OF JOHN. Mark i. 1–8: Luke iii. 1–17 (John i. 6–28). Here the <i>synoptic narrative</i> (i.e. the narrative common to the three Evangelists) begins, its extent being the same as that specified by Peter in Acts i. 22, ‘<i>from the baptism of John unto that same day that He was taken up from us.</i>’ For a comparison of the narratives in the various sections, see notes on St. Mark. In <i>this </i>Gospel, I have generally confined myself to the <i>subject-matter</i>.<h2><u><b>1. In those days</b>]</u></h2> The last matter mentioned was the dwelling at Nazareth; and though we must not take the connexion strictly as implying that <i>Joseph </i>dwelt there all the intermediate thirty years, “<i>those days</i>” must be understood to mean that we take up the persons of the narrative where we left them; i.e. dwelling at Nazareth.<h3><u><b>came</b>]</u></h3> literally, <b>comes forward—</b>‘makes his appearance.’ Euthymius asks the question, <i>whence?</i> and answers it, <i>from the recesses of the wilderness</i>. But this can hardly be, owing to the “<i>in the wilderness</i>” following. The verb is used absolutely. The title “John <i>the Baptist</i>” shews that St. Matthew was writing for those who well knew John the Baptist as an historical personage. Josephus, in mentioning him, calls him “<i>John who is called the Baptist.</i>” John was strictly speaking a <i>prophet</i>; belonging to the legal dispensation; a rebuker of sin, and preacher of repentance. The expression in St. Luke, “<i>the word of God came to John,</i>” is the usual formula for the divine commission of the Prophets (Jer. i. 1: Ezek. vi.1; vii. 1, &c.). And the effect of the Holy Spirit on John was more in accordance with the O.T. than the N.T. inspiration; more of a sudden overpowering influence, as in the Prophets, than a gentle indwelling manifested through the individual character, as in the Apostles and Evangelists.—The baptism of John was of a deeper significance than that usual among the Jews in the case of proselytes, and formed an integral part of his divinely appointed office. It was emphatically the baptism of <i>repentance </i>(Luke iii. 3), but not that of <i>regeneration </i>(Titus iii. 5).<br><br>We find in Acts xviii. 24–26; xix. 1–7, accounts of persons who had received the baptism of John, who believed, and (in Apollos’s case) taught accurately the things (i.e. facts concerning the Lord; but required instruction (in doctrine), and rebaptizing in the name of the Lord Jesus. Whether the baptism practised by the disciples before the Resurrection was of the same kind, and required this renewal, is uncertain. The fact of our Lord Himself having received baptism from John, is decisive against the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w8hmSlu9BwQCcwfTv0ESbr24JZtcgMQ2/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This tract was not strictly a <i>desert</i>, but thinly peopled, and abounding in pastures for flocks. This <i>wilderness </i>answers to “<i>all the country round about Jordan</i>” in Luke iii. 3. See note on ch. iv. 1.<h2><u><b>2. Repent</b>]</u></h2> Used by the Baptist in the O.T. sense of <i>turning to God as His people</i>, from the spiritual idolatry and typical adultery in which the faithless among the Jews were involved. This, of course, included personal amendment in individuals. See Luke iii. 10–14. Josephus describes John as “‘commanding the Jews to practise virtue, and justice to their neighbour, and piety towards God, and thus to receive his baptism.”<h3><u><b>the kingdom of heaven</b>]</u></h3> An expression peculiar in the N.T. to St. Matthew. The more usual one is “<i>the Kingdom of God:</i>” but “<i>the Kingdom of heaven</i>” is common in the Rabbinical writers, who do not however, except in one or two places, mean by it <i>the reign of the Messiah</i>, but <i>the Jewish religion—the theocracy</i>. Still, from the use of it by St. Matthew here, and in ch. iv. 17, x. 7, we may conclude that it was used by the Jews, and understood, to mean <i>the advent the Christ</i>, probably from the prophecy in Dan. ii. 44; vii. 13, 14, 27.<h2><u><b>3. For this is he</b>]</u></h2> <i>Not the words of the Baptist</i>, meaning “<i>for I am he,</i>” as in John i. 23, but <i>of the Evangelist</i>; and “<i>is</i>” is not for “<i>was,</i>” but is the prophetic present, representing to us the place which the Baptist fills in the divine purposes, Of <b>for</b>, Bengel says well, that it gives tho cause why John then came forward, as described in ver. 1, 2, viz. because it had been thus predicted. —The primary and literal application of this prophecy to <i>the return from captivity</i> is very doubtful. If it <i>ever had</i> such an application, we may safely say that its predictions were so imperfectly and sparingly fulfilled in that return, or any thing which followed it, that we are necessarily directed onward to its greater fulfilment—the announcement of the kingdom of Christ. Euthymius remarks, that the ways and paths of the Lord are men’s souls, which must be cleared of the thorns of passion and the stones of sin, and thus made straight and level for His approach.<h2><u><b>4. And the same John</b>]</u></h2> rather, <b>now John himself</b>, recalling the reader from the prophetic testimony, to the person of John. As John was the Elias of prophecy, so we find in his outward attire a striking similarity to Elias, who was “<i>an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins.</i>” 2 Kings i. 8. The garment of camel’s hair was not the camel’s skin with the hair on, which would be too heavy to wear, but raiment woven of camel’s hair. From Zech. xiii. 4, it seems that such a dress was known as the prophetic garb: ‘neither shall they (the prophets) wear a rough garment to deceive.’<h3><u><b>locusts</b>]</u></h3> There is no difficulty here. The locust, permitted to be eaten, Levit. xi. 22, was used as food by the lower orders in Judea, and mentioned by Strabo and Pliny as eaten by the Æthiopians, and by many other authors, as articles of food. Jerome mentions it as the custom in the East and Libya: and Shaw found locusts eaten by the Moors in Barbary. (Travels, p. 164.)<h3><u><b>wild honey</b>]</u></h3> See 1 Sam. xiv. 25. Here again there is no need to suppose any thing else meant but honey made by wild bees. Schulz found such honey in wilderness in our own time. See Psalm lxxxi. 16: Judg. xiv. 8: Deut. xxxii.13.<h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2><b> all the region round about Jordan</b> means all the neighbourhood of<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTqBUm0mLRHiKEGBPvPFRlON0h58A-bq/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Parts of Peræa, Samaria, Galilee, and Gaulonitis come under this denomination.—There need be no surprise at such multitudes going out to John. The nature of his announcement, coupled with the prevalent expectation of the time, was enough to produce this effect. See, as strictly consistent with this account, chap. xi. 7—15.<h2><u><b>6. were baptized</b>]</u></h2> When <i>men </i>were admitted as proselytes, three rites were performed— <i>circumcision, baptism, </i>and <i>oblation</i>; when <i>women</i>, two—<i>baptism </i>and <i>oblation</i>. The baptism was administered in the day-time, by immersion of the whole person; and while standing in the water the proselyte was instructed in certain portions of the law. The whole families of proselytes, including infants, were baptized. It is most probable that John’s baptism in outward form resembled that of proselytes. See above, on ver. 1. Some deny that the proselyte baptism was in use before the time of John: but the contrary has been generally supposed, and maintained. Indeed the baptism or lustration of a proselyte on admission would follow, as a matter of course, by analogy from the constant legal practice of lustration after all uncleannesses: and it is difficult to imagine a time when it would not be in use. Besides, it is highly improbable that the Jews should have borrowed the rite from the Christians, or the Jewish hierarchy from John.<h3><u><b>confessing their sins</b>]</u></h3> From the form and expression, this does not seem to have been merely ‘shewing a contrite spirit,’ ‘confessing themselves sinners,’ but <i>a particular and individual confession</i>; not, however, made privately to John, but before the people: see his exhortation to the various classes in Luke iii. 10–15: nor in every case, but in those which required it.<h2><u><b>7. Pharisees and Sadducees</b>]</u></h2> These two sects, according to Josephus, Antt. xiii. 5. 9, originated at the same period, under Jonathan the High Priest (B.C. 159–144). The PHARISEES, deriving their name probably from “<i>Parash,</i>” ‘he separated,’ took for their distinctive practice the strict observance of the law and all its requirements, written and oral. They had great power over the people, and are numbered by Josephus, as being, about the time of the death of Herod the Great, above 6000. We find in the Gospels the Pharisees the most constant opponents of our Lord, and His discourses frequently directed against them. The character of the sect as a whole was <i>hypocrisy</i>; the outside acknowledgment and honouring of God and his law, but inward and practical denial of Him; which rendered them the enemies of the simplicity and genuineness which characterized our Lord’s teaching. Still, among them were undoubtedly pious and worthy men, honourably distinguished from the mass of the sect; John iii.1: Actsv.34, The various points of their religious and moral belief will be treated of as they occur in the text of the Gospels.<br><br>The SADDUCEES are <i>said </i>to have derived their name from one Sadok, about the time of Alexander the Great (B.C. 323): but they were named from the Hebrew <i>Tsaddik, righteousness</i>, more probably. They <i>rejected all tradition</i>, but did not, as some have supposed, confine their canon of Scripture to the Pentateuch. The denial of a future state does not appear to have been an original tenet of Sadduceism, but to have sprung from its abuse. The particular side of religionism represented by the Sadducees was bare literal moral conformity, without any higher views or hopes. They thus escaped the dangers of tradition, but fell into deadness and worldliness, and a denial of spiritual influence. While our Lord was on earth, this state of mind was very prevalent among the educated classes throughout the Roman empire; and most of the Jews of rank and station were Sadducees. —The two sects, mutually hostile, are found frequently in the Gospels united in opposition to our Lord (see ch. xvi. 1, 6, 11; xxii. 23, 34; also Acts iv. 1); the Pharisees representing hypocritical superstition; the Sadducees, carnal unbelief.<h3><u><b>come</b>]</u></h3> It would appear here as if these Pharisees and Sadducees came with others, and because others did, without any worthy motive, and they were probably deterred by his rebuke from undergoing baptism at his hands. We know, from Luke vii. 30, that the Pharisees in general ‘<i>were not baptized of him.</i>’<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rl5i5G9Rsu3XxvKzPE5SQnFuJAn95zS9/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 82:</a></h3><br><h3><u><b>the wrath to come</b>]</u></h3> The reference of John’s ministry to prophecy concerning Elias, Mal iii. 1; iv. 5(Mark i. 2), would naturally suggest to men’s minds ‘the wrath to come’ there also foretold. It was the general expectation of the Jews that troublous times would accompany the appearance of the Messiah. John is now speaking in the true character of a prophet, foretelling the wrath soon to be poured on the Jewish nation.<h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2><b> therefore</b> expresses an inference from their apparent intention of fleeing from the wrath to come: q.d. ‘if you are really so minded,’. . .<h2><u><b>9. think not to say</b>]</u></h2> Not merely equivalent to “<i>say not</i>:” but, <b>Do not fancy you may say</b>, &c. The expression <b>to say within yourselves</b>, as similar expressions in Scripture (e.g. Ps. x. 6, 11; xiv.1: Eccl. i. 16; ii. 15, al. fr.), is used to signify the act by which outward circumstances are turned into thoughts of the mind.<h3><u><b>of these stones</b>]</u></h3> The pebbles or shingle on the beach of the Jordan. He possibly referred to Isa. li. 1, 2. This also is prophetic, of the admission of the Gentile church. See Rom. iv. 16: Gal iii. 29. Or we may take the interpretation which Chrysostom prefers, also referring to Isa. li. 1, 2: <i>Think not that your perishing will leave Abraham without children: for God is able to raise him up children even from stones, as He created man out of dust at the beginning,</i> The <i>present </i>tenses, “<i>is laid,</i>” “<i>is cut down,</i>” imply the law, or habit, which now and henceforward, in the kingdom of heaven prevails: ‘<i>from this time it is so.</i>’<br><br><b>ll. whose shoes,</b> &c.) Lightfoot shews that it was the token of a slave having become his master’s property, to <i>loose </i>his shoe, to <i>tie </i>the same, or to <i>carry</i> the necessary articles for him to the bath. The expressions therefore in all the Gospels amount to the same.<h3><u><b>with the Holy Ghost, and with fire</b>]</u></h3> This was literally falfilled at the day of Pentecost: but Origen and others refer the words to the baptism of the <i>righteous by the Holy Spirit</i>, and <i>of the wicked by fire</i>. I have no doubt that this this is a mistake in the present case, though apparently (to the superficial reader) borne out by ver. 12. The <i>double </i>symbolic reference of fire, elsewhere found, e.g. Mark ix. 50, as purifying the good and consuming the evil, though <i>illustrated </i>by these verses, is hardly to be pressed into the interpretation of <i>fire </i>in this verse, the prophecy <i>here </i>being solely of that higher and more perfect baptism to which that of John was a mere introduction. To separate off “<i>with the Holy Ghost</i>” as belonging to one set of persons, and “<i>with fire</i>” as belonging to another, when both are united in “<i>you,</i>” is in the last degree harsh, besides introducing confusion into the whole. The members of comparison in this verse are <i>strictly parallel</i> to one another: the <i>baptism by water</i>, the end of which is “<i>repentance,</i>” a mere transition state, a note of preparation,—and the <i>baptism by the Holy Ghost and fire</i>, the end of which is (ver. 12) <i>sanctification</i>, the entire aim and purpose of man’s creation and renewal. Thus the <i>official superiority</i> of the Redeemer (which is all that our Evangelist here deals with) is fully brought out. The superiority of <i>nature </i>and <i>pre-existence</i> is reserved for the fuller and more dogmatic account in John i.<h2><u><b>12. whose fan,</b> &c.]</u></h2> In the Rabbinical work Midrash Tehillim, on Ps. ii., the same figure is found: “The winnowing is at hand: they throw the straw into the fire, the chaff to the wind, but preserve the wheat in the floor; so the nations of the world shall be the conflagration of a<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/106VN0ytWZtnOeK2pCb7yDHoa9nVHi8Lr/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Or perhaps owing to the verb (<b>shall cleanse from one end to the other</b>), the <i>floor itself</i>, which was an open hard-trodden space in the middle of the field. See “The Land and the Book,” p. 538 ff., where there is an illustration. “Very little use is now made of the <i>fan</i>, but I have seen it employed to <i>purge the floor</i> of the refuse dust, which the owner throws away as useless,” p. 540.<h3><u><b>chaff</b>]</u></h3> Not only <i>the chaff</i>, but also <i>the straw</i>: see reff.: ‘all that is not wheat.’<h2><u><b>13–17.</b>]</u></h2> JESUS HIMSELF BAPTIZED BY HIM. Mark i. 9–11: Luke iii. 21, 22. It does not appear exactly <i>when the baptism of our Lord took place</i>. If the comparative age of the Baptist is taken into account, we should suppose it to have been about six months after this latter began his ministry. But this is no sure guide. The <i>place </i>was <i>Bethany </i>(the older reading), <i>beyond Jordan</i>; John. i. 28.<h2><u><b>13. to be baptized</b>]</u></h2> Why should our Lord, who was <i>without sin</i>, have come to <i>a baptism of repentance?</i> Because He was <i>made sin for us</i>: for which reason also He suffered the curse of the law. It became Him, being <i>in the likeness of sinful flesh</i>, to go through those appointed rites and purifications which belonged to that flesh. There is no more strangeness in His having been baptized by John, than in His keeping the Passovers. The one rite, as the other, belonged to sinners—and <i>among the transgressors He was numbered</i>. The prophetic words in Ps, xl. 12, spoken in the person of our Lord, indicate, in the midst of sinlessness, the most profound apprehension of the sins of that nature which He took upon him. I cannot suppose the baptism to have been sought by our Lord merely t<i>o honour John</i>, or as <i>knowing that it would be the occasion of a divine recognition</i> of his Messiahship, and thus pre-ordained by God: but <i>bonâ fide</i>, as bearing the infirmities and carrying the sorrows of mankind, and thus beginning here the triple baptism of water, fire, and blood, two parts of which were now accomplished, and of the third of which He himself speaks, Luke xii. 50, and the beloved Apostle, 1 John v. 8.—His baptism, as it was our Lord’s <i>closing </i>act of obedience under the Law, in His hitherto concealed life of legal submission, His fulfilling all righteousness, so was His <i>solemn inauguration and anointing for the higher official life of mediatorial satisfaction</i> which was now opening upon Him. See Rom. i. 3, 4. We must not forget that the <i>working out of perfect righteousness in our flesh</i> by the entire and spotless keeping of God’s law (Deut. vi. 25), was, in the main, <i>accomplished during the thirty years previous to our Lord’s official ministry.</i><br><br><b>14. forbad</b>) Rather, <b>tried to hinder</b>: the word implies the active and earnest preventing, with the gesture, or hand, or voice. There is only an <i>apparent </i>inconsistency between the speech of John in this sense, and the assertion made by him in John i, 33, ‘I knew him not.’ Let us regard the matter in this light :—John begins his ministry by a commission from God, who also admonishes him, that He, whose Forerunner he was, would be in time revealed to him by a special sign. Jesus comes to be baptized by him. From the nature of his relationship to our Lord, he could not but know those events which had accompanied his birth, and his subsequent life of holy and unblamable purity and sanctity. My impression from the words of this verse certainly is, that he <i>regarded Him as the Messiah</i>. Still, his belief wanted that full and entire assurance which the occurrence of the predicted sign gave him, which the word <b>knew </b>implies, and which would justify him in announcing Him to his disciples as the Lamb of God.<h2><u><b>15. now</b>]</u></h2> The exact meaning is difficult. It cannot well be that which the A. V. at first sight gives, that something was to be done <i>now</i>, inconsistent with the actual and hereafter-to-be-manifested relation of the two persons, Rather—‘<i>though what has been said</i> (ver, ]4) <i>is true, yet the time is</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AVhFtL9gXD5xntO8PsVNywim0qtrYJ78/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Stier remarks that now was fulfilled the prophetic announcement of Ps. xl. 7, 8.<h3><u><b>us</b>]</u></h3> not for me, but for me and thee. I cannot help thinking that this word glances at the relationship and previous acknowledged destinations of the speakers. It has however a wider sense, as spoken by Him who is now first coming forth officially as the <i>Son of Man</i>, extending over <i>all those whose baptism plants them in his likeness</i>, Rom. vi.<h3><u><b>righteousness</b>]</u></h3> <b>requirements of the law</b>. See ch. vi. 1, where the sense is general, as here.<h2><u><b>16. baptised</b>]</u></h2> On this account I would make the following remarks. (1) The appearance and voice seem to have been manifested to <i>our Lord and the Baptist only</i>. They may have been <i>alone </i>at the time: or, if not, we have an instance in Acts ix. 7, of such an appearance being confined to one person, while the others present were unconscious of it. We can hardly however, with some of the Fathers, say, that it was “<i>a spiritual beholding,</i>” — or that “<i>the appearance was a vision, not reality.</i>” (2) The Holy Spirit descended not only in the <i>manner </i>of a dove, but <i>in bodily shape</i> (|| Luke): which I cannot understand in any but the literal sense, as THE BODILY SHAPE OF A DOVE, seen by the Baptist. There can be no objection to this, the straightforward interpretation of the narrative, which does not equally apply to the Holy Spirit being <i>visible at all</i>, which John himself asserts Him to have been (John i. 32—34), even more expressly than is asserted here. Why the Creator Spirit may not have assumed an organized body bearing symbolical meaning, as well as any other material form, does not seem clear. This was the ancient, and is the <i>only honest</i> interpretation. All the modern explanations of the “<i>like a dove,</i>” as importing the <i>manner </i>of coming down belong to the vain rationalistic attempt to reduce down that which is miraculous. The express assertion of St. Luke, and the fact that all four Evangelists have used the same expression, which they would not have done if it were a mere medium of comparison, are surely a sufficient refutation of this rationalizing (and, I may add, blundering) interpretation. (3) Two circumstances may be noticed respecting the manner of the descent of the Spirit:it was, <i>as a dove</i> :—the Spirit as manifested in our Lord was <i>gentle </i>and <i>benign</i>. This was not a sudden and temporary descent of the Spirit, but a <i>permanent </i>though special anointing of the Saviour for his holy office. It ‘<i>abode upon Him,</i>’ John i. 32. And from this moment His ministry and mediatorial work (in the active official sense) begins. Immediately, the Spirit carries Him away to the wilderness: the day of His return thence (possibly; but see notes on John i. 29) John points Him out as the Lamb of God: then follows the calling of Andrew, Peter, Philip, and Nathanael, and the third day after is the first miracle at the marriage in Cana. But we must not imagine any <i>change </i>in the nature or person of our Lord to have taken place at his baptism. The anointing and crowning are but <i>signs </i>of the official assumption of the power which the king has by a right independent of, and higher than these. (4) The whole narrative is in remarkable parallelism with that of the Transfiguration. There we have our Lord supernaturally glorified in the presence of two great prophetic personages, Moses and Elias, who speak of His decease, —on the journey to which He forthwith sets out (ch. xvii. 22, compared with xix. 1); and accompanied by the same testimony of the voice from heaven, uttering the same words, with an addition accordant with the truth then symbolized. (5) In connexion with apocryphal additions, the following are not without interest: <i>When Jesus had gone down to the water, a flame was lit up in the Jordan: and when He had come up from the water, lo, the heavens</i>, &c.

Mark i. 12, 13: Luke iv. 1–13.<h2><u><b>1. led up of (by) the spirit</b>]</u></h2> The Spirit carried Him away, (see Acts viii. 39,) “<i>driveth him,</i>” Mark i. 12. Had St. Luke’s “<i>was led in</i> (thus literally) <i>the Spirit</i>” been our <i>only </i>account, we might have supposed what took place to have been done <i>in a vision</i>: but the expressions in the two other Evangelists entirely preclude this. The <i>desert </i>here spoken of may either be the traditional place of the Temptation near Jericho (thence called <i>Quarantaria</i>: it is described in “The Land and the Book,” p. 617, as a high and precipitous mountain, with its side facin the plain perpendicular, and apparently as high as the rock of Gibraltar, and with caverns midway below, hewn in the rock), or as scripture parallelism between Moses, Elias, and our Lord, leads one to think, the <i>Arabian desert of Sinai</i>. <b>to be tempted</b>] The express <i>purpose</i> of His being <i>led up</i>. Hence it is evident that our Lord this time wes not ‘led up’ of his own will and design: but, as a part of the conflict with the Power of Darkness, He was <i>brought </i>to the Temptation. As He had been subject to his earthly parents at Nazareth, so now He is subject, in the outset of his official course, to His Heavenly Parent, and is by His will thus carried up to be tempted. In reverently considering the nature and end of this temptation, we may observe, (1) That the whole is <i>undoubtedly an objective historical narrative</i>, recording an actual conflict between our Redeemer and the Power of Evil. (2) That it is undetermined by the <i>letter </i>of the sacred text, whether the Tempter appeared <i>in a bodily shape</i>, or, <i>as a spirit</i>, was permitted to exert a certain power, as in ver. 5, and ver. 8, over the person of our Lord, even as the Holy Spirit did in ver.1. If the latter were the case, the words spoken at the various of the temptation, were suggested by this Evil Power to the soul of our Redeemer. But (3) such an interpretation, while it cannot justly be accused of unreality by any who do not reject belief in the spiritual world, hardly meets the expressions of the text, “<i>came</i> (approached) <i>to him,</i>” ver. 9, and “<i>leaveth him</i>” ver. 11. Nor do the two members of ver. 11 correspond to one another in this case, for the angels must have been visible and corporeal, as in the parallel case at Gethsemane, Luke xxii. 43.<h2><u><b>2. when he had fasted</b>]</u></h2> Not in the wider ecclesiastical sense of the word, but its strict meaning, of <i>abstaining from all food whatever</i>; Luke, ver.2. Similarly Moses, Exod. xxxiv. 28; and Elijah, 1 Kings xix. 8.<h3><u><b>he was afterward an hungred</b>]</u></h3> Then probably <i>not during the time itself</i>. The period of the fast, as in the case of Moses, was Spent in a spiritual ecstasy, during which the wants of the natural body were suspended.<h2><u><b>3. when the tempter came</b>]</u></h2> From the words of both St. Mark and St. Luke, it appears that our Lord was tempted <i>also during the forty days</i>. Whether the words of St. Mark, “<i>he was with the wild beasts,</i>” allude to <i>one kind</i> of temptation, is uncertain: see note on Mark i. 13.—The words “<i>came to him</i>” need not be understood of the <i>first </i>approach, but the first <i>recorded</i>— ‘at a certain time the tempter approaching, &c’<h3><u><b>If thou be</b>]</u></h3> “thinking to beguile Him with his flattery,” Chrys. Or, as Euthymius, “thinking that He would be irritated by this address, as being reproached with not being the Son of God.” At all events, there is no <i>doubt </i>expressed, as some think.<h3><u><b>Son of God</b>]</u></h3> Our Lord does not give way to the temptation, so as to meet him with an open declaration, ‘I am the Son of God:’ thus indeed He might have asserted his lordship over him, but not have been <i>his Conqueror for us</i>. The first word which He uses against him, reaches far deeper: ‘<i>Man</i> shall not live,’ &c. “This, like the other text, is taken from the history of Israel’s temptation in the wilderness: for Israel represents, in a foreshadowing type, the Son of Man, the servant of God Righteousness, the one that was <i>to come</i>, in whom alone that nature which in all men has degenerated into sin, ‘<i>fulfils all righteousness</i>’ Adam stood not,—Israel according to the flesh stood not,—when the Lord their God tempted them: but rather, after Satan’s likeness, tempted their God: but now the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rSz76FMAC9EaGw_3N7yTR4yqO7NSiIZH/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Compare John iv. 32, 34.<h2><u><b>5. taketh him up</b>]</u></h2> power being most probably given to the tempter over the person of our Lord. In St. Luke, this temptation stands <i>third</i>. The real order is evidently that in the text; for otherwise our Lord’s final answer, ver. 10, would not be in its place. It may be observed, that St. Luke makes no assertion as to succession, only introducing each temptation with <i>and</i>: whereas “<i>then</i>” and “<i>again</i>” here seem to mark succession. For “the holy city” see reff.<br><br><b>setteth him</b> —by the same power by which he brought Him.<h3><u><b>pinnacle</b>]</u></h3> The general opinion, that our Lord was placed on <i>Herod’s royal portico</i>, is probably right. That portico overhung the ravine of Kedron from a dizzy height, so as to make one giddy with looking down, as described by Josephus, Antt. xv. 11. 5. The argument that it was probably <i>on the other side, next the court</i>, is grounded on the perfectly gratuitous assumption, that an <i>exhibition to the people</i> was intended. There is no authority for this in the text; the temptation being one not of ambition, but of <i>presumption</i>. The inference from Eusebius, who, quoting Hegesippus, (Hist. ii. 23) describes James the Just as set on and thrown from the pinnacle of the temple, among the people, is not decisive: for this term might embrace either side, as ‘the cornice,’ or ‘the parapet’ would.<h2><u><b>6. It is written</b>]</u></h2> cited (nearly verbatim from the LXX, as almost all the texts in this narrative) as applying to all servants of God in general, and à fortiori to the Son of God: not as a of the Messiah.<h2><u><b>7. again</b>]</u></h2> not ‘on the contrary,’ which the original word never simply means, not even in Gal. v. 3: 1 John ii. 8. The addition of a second Scripture <i>qualifies </i>and <i>interprets </i>the first; but <i>does not refute</i> it.<h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> The enquiry where and what this mountain was, is entirely nugatory, no data being furnished by the text.<h3><u><b>sheweth him all the k. of the world</b>]</u></h3> The additional words in Luke, “<i>in a moment of time,</i>” are valuable as pointing out to us clearly the supernatural character of the vision. If it be objected, that in that case there was no need for the ascent of the mountain,—I answer, that such natural accessories are made use of frequently in supernatural revelations: see especially Rev. xxi. 10. The attempts to restrict “the world” to <i>Palestine</i>, (which was, besides, God’s peculiar portion and vineyard, <i>as distinguished from</i> the Gentile world,) or <i>the Roman</i> empire, are mere subterfuges: as is also the giving to “sheweth” the sense of “points out the direction of.”<br><br>In this last temptation the enemy reveals himself openly, as the Prince of this world, and as the father of lies: for though power is given him over this world and its sons, his assertion here is most untrue.<h2><u><b>10.</b>]</u></h2> Our<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YsdYaMigMQs9Qh5GKcfgOniMSdqRpnNZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

CALLING OF PETER, ANDREW, JAMES, AND JOHN. Mark i. 14—20. Luke iv. 14, 15. Between the last verse and this is a considerable interval of time. After returning from the Temptation (see note on John i. 28, end) our Lord was pointed out by John the Baptist, (ib. vv. 29—34,) and again on the morrow to two of his disciples, Andrew and (probably) John, who followed Him, and were (on the next day? see note, John i. 44) joined by Simon Peter (35—43): then on the morrow Philip and Nathanael we recalled (44—52); three days after was marriage in Cana (ii. 1- 11); then our Lord went down to Capernaum and remained not many days (12); then followed the Passover; the cleansing of the temple (13—22); the belief of many on Jesus (23—25); the discourse with Nicodemus (iii. 1—21); the baptizing by Jesus (i.e. his disciples) (22—24); the question about purifying, and testimony of the Baptist (25—36); the journey through Samaria into Galilee, and discourse with the woman of Samaria (iv. 1—42); the return to Cana, and healing of the ruler’s son in Capernaum (43—54); and the journey to Jerusalem related in John v. 1. After that chapter St. John breaks off the first part his narrative; and between his v. 47 and vi. 1, comes in the synoptic narrative, Matt. iv. 12—xiv. 15: Mark i.14—vi. 30: Luke iv. 14—ix. 10. This omission is in remarkable consistency with St. Matthew's account of his own calling in ch. ix. 9. Being employed in his business in the neighbourhood of Capernaum, he now first becomes personally acquainted with the words and actions of our Lord. From what circumstance the former miracle in Capernaum had not attracted his attention, we cannot, of course, definitely say; we can, however, easily conceive. Our Lord was not then <i>in </i>Capernaum; for the ruler sent to Him, and the cure was wrought by word at a distance. If Matthew’s attention had not been called to Jesus before, he might naturally omit such a narrative, which John gives probably from personal knowledge. The <i>synoptic narrative generally</i> omits this whole section of our Lord’s travels and ministry. Its sources of information, until the last visit to Jerusalem, seem to have been <i>exclusively Galilean</i>, and <i>derived from persons who became attached to Him at a later period than any of the events recorded in that first portion of John’s Gospel</i>. The objections to this view are, the narrative, in the three Gospels, of the baptism and temptation: but the former of these would be abundantly testified by John’s disciples, many of whom became disciples of Jesus; and the latter could only have been derived from the mouth of our Lord Himself.<h2><u><b>12. delivered up</b>]</u></h2> This seems to have been the usual and well-known term for the imprisonment of John. The same word in the original is also the usual one for the betrayal and apprehension of our Lord Himself.<h3><u><b>departed</b>]</u></h3> <b>re- tired, withdrew</b>; see ch. ii. 22, and note. No notice is given <i>whence </i>this withdrawal took place. The narrative is evidently taken up after an interval, and without any intention that it should follow closely on ver. 11. Wieseler sees in this a proof that St. Matthew recognized a ministry in Judæa during the interval. I cannot quite think this, but certainly he does not <i>exclude </i>it.<h2><u><b>13. leaving Nazareth</b>]</u></h2> Not on account of the behaviour of the Nazarenes to Him after the preaching in<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Z_uSkXwesX7LQZeZzLnLhFIAtjGaOJi/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It besides was the residence of four at least of the Apostles, Andrew and Peter, and James and John—and probably of Matthew. “<i>Kephar Nahum,</i>” <i>the village of consolation</i>. So Josephus. It is from this time called ‘<i>His own city,</i>’ ch. ix. 1, see also ch. xvii. 24.<h2><u><b>15.</b>]</u></h2> This prophecy is spoken with direct reference to the days of the Messiah. It is here freely rendered from the Hebrew, without any regard to the LXX, which is wholly different. This, coming so immediately after a string of quotations literally from the LXX, seems to mark the beginning of a new portion of the Gospel, agreeably to what was said before.<h3><u><b>the way of the sea</b>]</u></h3> the country round the coast of the lake. All the members of this sentence are in apposition with one another: thus <i>beyond Jordan</i> is not a description of the land before spoken of, which was not thus situated, but of a different tract. The later meaning of the phrase, as signifying the tract to the west of the Jordan, and which naturally sprung during the captivity, is not to be thought of in Isaiah, who wrote before that event.<h3><u><b>Galilee of the Gentiles</b>]</u></h3> <i>Galilee superior</i>, near to Tyre and Sidon, which was inhabited by a variety of nations.<h2><u><b>17. began to preach ..</b>]</u></h2> That is, <i>began His ministry in Galilee</i>. The account of Matthew, being that of an eyewitness, begins where his own experience began. It is not correct to suppose, as some of the German Commentators have done, (De Wette, Strauss,) that this preaching of repentance was <i>of a different character from the after-teaching of our Lord</i>: we recognize the same formula, though only partly cited, in ch. x.7: Luke x. 10, and find our Lord <i>still preaching repentance</i>, Luke xiii. 3, after repeated declarations of His Messiahship.<h2><u><b>18. by the sea of Galilee</b>]</u></h2> The lake of Gennesareth or Tiberias (John vi. 1), called in the O.T. “the sea of Chinnereth,” Num. xxxiv. 11, or Chinneroth, Josh. xii. 3. It is of an oval shape, about 13 geographical miles long, and 6 broad: and is traversed by the Jordan from N. to S. “Its most remarkable feature is its deep depression, being no less than 700 feet below the level of the ocean.” See the interesting article by Mr. Porter in Smith’s Biblical Dictionary.<br><br>If we give any consideration to the circumstances here related, we cannot fail to see that the account in John is admirably calculated to complete the narrative. We have there furnished to us the reason why these two brethren were so ready to arise and follow One, whom, if we had this account only, we should infer they had never before seen. Add to this, that there is every probability that one of the other pair of brethren, John the son of Zebedee, is there described as having gone with Andrew to the dwelling of our Lord. It also tends to confirm the chronological view here taken, that Philip, the only one mentioned expressly by John as <i>having been called by Jesus</i>, is <i>not mentioned here as called</i>: and that Andrew, and the other disciple of John the Baptist, clearly were not <i>called </i>by Jesus in John i. 35–40, or the words “<i>abode with him that day,</i>” could not have been used: that these two <i>continued </i>disciples of the Baptist, is not probable; but that they were henceforth,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Im1V2Onc86GQCpWNBmVGXFiv3pD8EvvU/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

I believe that the disciple whom Jesus loved was in His company during the whole of the events in John ii. iii. iv. and v., and on His return from Judea with His disciples, John having for a time returned to his business, as our Lord was now resident in Capernaum, received, as here related, this more solemn and final call. We must remember, that the disciples would naturally have gone up to Jerusalem at the Passover, John ii. 23, <i>without a call from the Lord</i>, and by what they saw there would become more firmly attached to him. The circumstance related in John xxi, that even after they were assured of the Resurrection, the Apostles <i>returned to their occupation</i> as fishermen, gives additional probability to the usual nation of the call in our text.<h2><u><b>20. left their nets, and followed him</b>]</u></h2> i.e. <i>from this time they were constant followers</i> of the Lord. But when He happened to be in the neighbourhood of their homes, they resumed their fishing; cf. Luke v. 1–11, which occurrence was, in my belief, different from, and later than the one related in our text. See notes there.<h2><u><b>23—25.</b>]</u></h2> HE MAKES A CIRCUIT OF GALILEE. (Mark i. 89: Luke iv. 44, ordinarily: but qu.? There is no necessity for believing this circuit of Galilee to be identical with those, even if we read <i>Galilee</i> in the passage in Luke. Our Lord made <i>many such circuits</i>.)<h2><u><b>23. synagogues</b>]</u></h2> These were the places of religious assembly among the Jews after the return from the captivity. Tradition, and the Targums, ascribe a very early origin to synagogues: and Deut. xxxi. 11, and Ps. lxxiv. 8, are cited as testimonies of it. But the former passage does not necessarily imply it: and it is doubtful whether that Psalm was not itself written after the captivity. They are generally supposed to have originated in Babylon, and thence to have been brought, at the return, into the mother land. See Neh. viii. 1–8. At the Christian era there were synagogues in every town, and in some larger towns several. See Acts ix. 2,20. In Jerusalem, according to the Rabbinical writings, there were upwards of 450. (See Acts vi. 9, and note.) The people assembled in them on sabbath and festival days, and in later times also on the second and fifth days of each week, for public prayer and the hearing of portions of Scripture. See Luke iv. 16: Acts xiii, 15. The officers of the synagogues were (1) <i>the ruler of the synagogue</i>, Luke viii. 49; xiii, 14: Acts xviii. 8, 17, who had the care of public order, and the arrangement of the service; (2) the Elders, Luke vii. 3: Mark v. 22: Acts xiii. 15, who seem to have formed a sort of council under the presidency of the Ruler; (3) the <i>legate </i>or <i>angel of the assembly</i>, who was the reader of prayers, and also secretary and messenger of the synagogues; (4) the <i>minister </i>(Luke iv. 20), or chapel clerk, whose office was to prepare the books for reading, to sweep, open, and shut the synagogue. Besides these, there appear to have been alms-gatherers. The synagogue was fitted up with seats, of which the first row were an object of ambition with the scribes (ch. xxiii. 6). A pulpit for the reader, lamps, and a chest, for keeping the sacred books, appear to complete the furniture of the ancient synagogue. Punishments, e.g. scourging, were inflicted in the synagogues. (See ch. x. 17; xxiii. 34: Luke ix. 49: Acts xxii. 19; xxvi.11.) The catechizing also of children seems to have taken place there, as also disputations on religious questions.—Our Lord was allowed to read and teach in the synagogues, although of mean extraction according to the flesh, because of His miracles, and His supposed character as the professed leader and teacher of a religious sect.<h3><u><b>preaching the gospel</b>]</u></h3> For the exact meaning of<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13KJvlV0Gm6kZ-NSVFtiME6YE_O5Co2Jd/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In this form peculiar to Matthew.<br><br>Without attempting a solution of the many difficulties which beset the question of time, place, and arrangement of our Lord’s Sermon on the Mount, I shall state the principal views of these subjects, and make some remarks upon them. One of the weightiest questions is, as to <i>the identity or otherwise of the Sermon with that given in Luke</i> vi. 20—49. There is (I) the view that they <i>are identical</i>. This is generally taken by ordinary readers of Scripture, from their similarity in many points. It is also taken by most of the modern German Commentators, who uniformly reject every attempt at harmonizing by supposing the same or similar words to have been twice uttered. This view is, however, beset by difficulties. For (<i>a</i>) the Sermon in Luke is expressly said to have been delivered <i>after </i>the selection of the Apostles: whereas that in the text is as expressly, by continual consecutive notes of time extending to the call of Matthew (before which the Apostles cannot have chosen,) placed <i>before </i>that event. And it is wholly unlikely that St. Matthew, assuming him to be the author of our Gospel, would have made a discourse, which he must have heard immediately after his call as an Apostle, take place that call.— Then (<i>b</i>) <i>this</i> discourse was spoken on <i>a mountain</i>,—<i>that</i>, after descending from a mountain, in the <i>plain</i>. Possibly this may be got over, by rendering St. Luke's expression “on a level place.” See note on Luke: and the citation from Stanley below. And again (<i>c</i>), the two discourses are, though containing much common matter, <i>widely different</i>. Of 107 verses in Matt., Luke contains only <i>thirty</i>: <i>his four</i> beatitudes are balanced by as many <i>woes</i>: and in his text, parts of the sermon are introduced by sayings, which do not precede them in Matt. (e.g. Luke vi. 39 ff., 45 ff.), but which naturally connect with them. (II) St. Luke <i>epitomized</i> this discourse, leaving out whatever was unsuitable for his Gentile readers, e.g. ch: v. 17–38. But this is improbable: for Luke in several verses is <i>fuller </i>than Matthew, and the whole discourse, as related by him, is connected and consecutive. (III) The two discourses are <i>wholly distinct</i>. This view is maintained by Greswell, vol. ii, Diss. xi., and principally from the arguments above noticed. But it also is not without grave difficulties, especially if we suppose, as most do, that Luke had the Gospel of Matthew before him. That two discourses wholly distinct should contain so much in common, seems unlikely and unnatural. It is hardly credibly that two great public special occasions should be selected by the Lord near the commencement of His ministry, and two discourses delivered to the same audience, not <i>identical</i>, which might have been very probable, and impressive from that very circumstance,—nor consecutive, nor explanatory the one of the other, but, only coinciding in fragments, and not even as two different reports at the distance of some years might be expected to do.

(IV) St. Matthew <i>gives a general compendium of the sayings of our Lord during this part of His ministry</i>, of which St. Luke’s discourse formed a <i>portion</i>, or perhaps was <i>another shorter compendium</i>. But the last stated objection applies with still greater force to this hypothesis, and renders it indeed quite untenable. Besides, it labours under the chronological difficulty in all its bearings. And to one who has observed throughout the close contextual connexion of the parts in this discourse, it will be quite incredible that they should be a mere collection of sayings, set down at hazard. See notes throughout. (V) The apparent discrepancies are sometimes reconciled by remembering, that <i>there is no fixed time mentioned in any Evangelist for the special ordination of the Apostles</i>, and that it is very doubtful whether they were at any set moment so ordained all together. Thus Matthew may have been a usual hearer of our Lord, and present with the whole of the Apostles, as related in Luke, though not yet formally summoned as related in Matt. ix. 9 ff. The introduction of the discourse in Luke by the words “<i>And it came to pass in those days</i>” (which I maintain to be, on Luke vi. 12, not only <i>possibly</i>, but <i>expressly </i>indefinite, and to indicate that the event so introduced may have happened at any time during the current great period of our Lord’s ministry, before, during, or after, those last narrated,) allows us great latitude in assigning Luke’s discourse to any precise time. This, however, leaves the difficulties (above stated under I) in supposing the discourses identical, in force, except the chronological one.—With regard to the many sayings of this sermon which occur, dispersed up and down, in Luke, see notes in their respective places, which will explain my view as to their connexion and original times of utterance, in each several instance. See also notes on Luke vi. 20—49.<h2><u><b>1. the mountain</b>]</u></h2> Either <i>some hill</i> near Capernaum well known by this name, and called by it in the reff. to Mark and Luke, (tradition, not earlier probably than the Crusades, which points out a hill between Capernaum and Tiberias as the Mount of Beatitudes, near the present Saphet, is in such a matter worthless as an authority. But the situation seems to modern travellers [see Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 368] “so strikingly to coincide with the intimations of the narrative, as almost to force the inference that in this instance the eye of those who selected the was for once rightly guided. It is the only height seen in this direction from the shores of the lake of Gennesareth. The plain on which it stands is easily accessible from the lake, and from that plain to the summit is but a few minutes’ walk. The platform at the top is evidently suitable for the collection of a multitude, and corresponds precisely to the ‘level place’ to which He would ‘come down’ as from one of its higher horns to address the people. Its situation is central both to the peasants of the Galilean hills, and the fishermen of the Galilean lake, between which it stands, and would therefore be a natural resort both to Jesus and His disciples when they retired for solitude from the shores of the sea, and also to the crowds who assembled ‘from Galilee, from Decapolis, from Jerusalem, from Judæa, and from beyond Jordan.’ None of the other mountains in the neighbourhood could answer equally well to this description, inasmuch as they are merged into the uniform barrier of hills round the lake: whereas this stands separate — ‘the mountain,’ which alone could lay claim to a distinct name, with the exception of the one height of Tabor, which is too distant to answer the requirements,”) or <i>the mountain district</i>, certainly imported by the word in ch. xiv. 23.—See a full description of the locality in Tholuck, Bergpredigt, ed. 3, pp. 63 ff.<h3><u><b>his disciples</b>]</u></h3> in the wider sense: including those of the Apostles already called, and all who had, either for a long or a short time, attached themselves to him as hearers. See John vi. 66.<h2><u><b>2. opened his mouth</b>]</u></h2> as in reff., a solemn introduction to some discourse or advice of importance.<h3><u><b>them</b>]</u></h3> i.e. his disciples. The discourse (see vv. 13, 14, 20, 48; ch. vi. 9; vii. 6) was spoken directly to the disciples, but (see vii. 28, 29) also generally to the multitudes. It is a divine commentary on the words with which His own and the Baptist’s preaching opened: “<i>Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</i>” It divides itself into various great sections, which see below.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WWeFavVWhI1JncjrlMsj7SHc7Umub6TO/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

As little can the <i>bare literal</i> sense of the words, which Julian scoffed at, be understood: viz. those who are <i>ill-furnished in mind</i>, and uneducated. See Rev. iii. 17. The idea (De Wette) is not improbable, that our Lord may have had a reference to the poor and subjugated Jewish people around him, once members of the theocracy, and now expectants of the Messiah’s temporal kingdom; and, from their condition and hopes, taken occasion to preach to them the deeper spiritual truth.<h3><u><b>their’s is the kingdom of heaven</b>]</u></h3> See Luke iv. 17—21: James ii. 5. The kingdom must here be understood in its widest sense: as the combination of all rights of Christian citizenship in this world, and eternal blessedness in the next, ch. vi. 33. But Tholuck well observes, that all the senses of “<i>the kingdom of God,</i>” or “<i>of heaven,</i>” or “<i>of Christ,</i>” are only different sides of the same great idea—the <i>subjection of all things to God in Christ.</i><h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> The spiritual qualification in the former verse must be carried on to this, and the mourning understood to mean not only that on account of sin, but <i>all such as happens to a man in the spiritual life</i>. All such mourners are blessed: for the Father of mercies and God of all consolation being their covenant God, His comfort shall overbear all their mourning, and taste the sweeter for it. In Luke ii. 25, the Messiah’s coming is called “<i>the consolation of Israel.</i>”—This beatitude is by many editors placed after ver. 5. But the authority is by no means decisive, and I cannot see how the logical coherence of the sentence is improved by it.—In placing these two beatitudes first, the Lord follows the order in Isa. lxi. 1, which He proclaimed in the synagogue at Nazareth, Luke iv. 18.<h2><u><b>5. the meek</b>]</u></h2> A citation from Ps. xxxvii. 11. The usual dividers and allotters of the earth being mighty and proud conquerors, and the Messiah being expected as such a conqueror, this announcement that the meek should inherit the earth, struck at the root of the temporal expectations of power and wealth in the Messiah’s kingdom. This meekness is not mere outward lowliness of demeanour, but that true <i>meekness</i> of Eph. iv. 2, whose active side is love, and its passive side long-suffering. On the promise, compare Isa. lvii. 13–15; lx. 21; 1 Cor. iii. 22. That kingdom of God which begins in the hearts of the disciples of Christ, and is not “of (sprung from) <i>this world,</i>” shall work onwards till it shall become <i>actually a kingdom over this earth</i>, and its subjects shall <i>inherit the earth</i>: first in its millennial, and finally in its renewed and blessed state for ever.<h2><u><b>6.</b>]</u></h2> See Ps. cvii. 9; lxv. 4; xxii. 26: Isa. xli. 17. This <i>hunger and thirst</i> is the true sign of that new life on which those born of the Spirit (John iii. 3, 5) have entered; and it is after <i>righteousness</i>, i.e. <i>perfect conformity to the holy will of God</i>. This was <i>His </i>meat, John iv. 34, They shall be <i>satisfied—in the new heaven and new earth, in which dwelleth righteousness</i>, 2 Pet. iii. 13. Compare the remarkable parallel Ps. xvii. 15. This hunger and thirst after righteousness, is admirably set forth in the three first petitions of the Lord’s prayer,—‘Hallowed be Thy name—Thy kingdom come—Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.’<h2><u><b>7. merciful</b>]</u></h2> “We may shew mercy, not by alms only, but by words: and if we have no other way, by tears. For manifold is the form of mercy, and wide is this command: They shall obtain mercy, here, from men; and there, from God,” Euthymius, expanding Chrysostom. This beatitude comprises every degree of sympathy and mutual love and help; from that fulness of it which is shed abroad in those who have been forgiven much, and therefore love much,—down to those first beginnings of the new birth, even among those who know not the Lord,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18hjFrQm9PbuINsB3JQSrcI4wA_dIyDpT/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is no Levitical cleanness, nor mere moral purity, that is here meant; but that <i>inner purity</i>, which (Acts xv. 9) is brought about by faith, has its fruit (1 Tim. i. 5) in <i>love</i>; which is opposed to all “<i>double mindedness</i>”’ (James i. 8), and all hypocrisy and outward colouring; so that pure in heart are those who have their “<i>hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.</i>” There is an allusion to the nearer vision of God attained by progressive sanctification, of which St. Paul speaks, 2 Cor. iii. 18,— begun indeed in this life, but not perfected till the next, 1 Cor. xiii. 12.<h2><u><b>9. peacemakers</b>]</u></h2> More than ‘<i>the peaceful</i>’ (Vulg.). is doubtful whether the word ever has this meaning. Thus Euthymius, mostly after Chrysostom: They who not only are themselves not men of strife, but make peace between others when at strife. They shall be called sons of God, because they have imitated His only Son; whose office it is to bring together the separated and to reconcile those at variance. But even thus we do not seem to reach the full meaning, which probably is, “<i>they that work peace;</i>” not confining the reference to the reconciliation of persons at variance: see note on James iii. 18.<h3><u><b>shall be called</b>]</u></h3> <i>implies </i>the reality, as in ver. 19; <b>shall</b> (not only be, but also) <b>be called</b>, i.e. recognized, in the highest sense, both generally, and by the Highest Himself, as such. Let it ever be remembered, according to the order of these beatitudes, and the assertion of James iii. 17, that the wisdom from above is <b>first</b> <i>pure</i>, <b>then </b><i>peaceable</i>, implying no compromise with evil. And it is in the working out of this purity that Luke xii. 51 is especially true. St. Augustine remarks, that martyrs are made not by the mere fact of suffering, but by the <i>cause </i>for which they suffer. And therefore it is added, ‘<i>for righteousness’ sake.</i>’<h2><u><b>10. persecuted</b>]</u></h2> See 1 Pet. iii. 14; iv. 14, which probably refers to this verse. The repitition of the promise in ver. 8 is a close of the string of promises as it began.<h2><u><b>11.</b>]</u></h2> With the preceding verse the beatitudes end, in their general reference, and in this our Lord addresses <i>His disciples</i> particularly. The actions described in this verse are the expansion of <b>persecuted </b>in the last.<h2><u><b>12. your reward</b>]</u></h2> A reward, not of debt, but of grace, as parable in ch. xx. 1 ff. clearly represents it. ‘An expression,’ as De Wette observes, ‘taken from our earthly commerce, and applied to spiritual things;” in which however we must remember, that the principal reference is to God as the giver, and not to us as the deservers: see the parable above cited, where the reward is not what was <i>earned</i>, but what was <i>covenanted</i>. These words, <i>in heaven</i>, must not be taken as having any bearing on the question as to the <i>future habitation</i> of the glorified saints. Their use in this end similar expressions is <i>not local</i>, but <i>spiritual</i>, indicating the blessed state when the kingdom of heaven shall have fully come. The local question is to be decided by wholly different testimonies of Scripture;— by the general tenor of prophecy, and the analogies of the divine dealings: and all of these seem to point rather to this earth, purified and renewed, than to <i>the heavens</i> in any ordinary sense of the term, as the eternal habitation of the blessed.<h3><u><b>so persecuted they</b>]</u></h3> For instance, Jeremiah was scourged, Jer. xx. 2; Zechariah son of Jehoiada was stoned, 2 Chron. xxiv. 21; Isaiah, according to Jewish tradition, was sawn asunder by Manasseh.—The reasoning implied in ‘for’ may be thus filled up: ‘and great will be <i>their </i>reward in heaven.”<br><br><b>13.</b>) The transition from the preceding verses is easy and natural, from the “<i>persecuted for righteousness’ sake,</i>” of which vv. 11, 12 were a sort of application, and the allusion to the ancient Prophets, to “<i>ye are the salt of the earth.</i>”—Elisha <i>healed the unwholesome</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yXDXupsjN1NcsUy1f8BdQsMUjDPZmLfJ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Yet it is worth noticing, that Maundrell, in his travels, found salt in the Valley of Salt, near Gehul, which had the appearance, but not the taste, having lost it by exposure to the elements (see the citation below);—and that Schǒttgen maintains that a kind of bitumen from the Dead Sea was called ‘salt of Sodom,’ and was used to sprinkle the sacrifices in the temple; which salt was used, when its savour was gone, to strew the temple pavement, that the priests might not slip. This, however, is but poorly made out by him. Dr. Thomson, ‘The Land and the Book,’ p. 381, mentions a case which came under his own observation: where a merchant of Sidon had stored up a quantity of salt in cottages with earthern floors, in consequence of which the salt was spoiled, and Dr. T. saw “large quantities of it literally thrown into the street, to be trodden under foot of men and beasts.” He adds, “It is a well-known fact that the salt of this country, when in contact with the ground, or exposed to rain and sun, does become insipid and useless. From the manner in which it is gathered, much earth and other impurities are necessarily collected with it. Not a little of it is so impure that it cannot be used at all: and such salt soon effloresces and turns to dust— not to fruitful soil, however. It is not only good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility wherever it is thrown: and this is the reason why it is cast into the street.”<br><br><b>the earth</b> means <i>mankind, and all creation</i>: but with a more <i>inward </i>reference, as to the working of the salt, than in “<i>the world,</i>” ver. 14, where the <i>light</i> is something <i>outwardly shewn</i>.<h3><u><b>shall it be salted</b>]</u></h3> it, i.e. the salt. The sense is: ‘If you become untrue to your high calling, and spiritually effete and corrupted, there are no ordinary means by which you can be re-converted and brought back to your former state, inasmuch as you have no teachers and guides over you, but ought yourselves to be teachers and guides to others.’ But we must not from this suppose that our Lord denies all repentance to those who have thus fallen: the scope of His saying must be taken into account, which is not to crush the fallen, but to quicken the sense of duty, and cause His disciples to walk worthily of their calling. (See Heb. vi. 4–6, and note on Mark ix. 49, 50.)<br><br>The <i>salt in the sacrifice</i> is the type of God’s <i>covenant of sanctification,</i> whereby this earth shall be again hallowed for Him: His people are the <i>instruments</i>, in His hand, of this wholesome salting: all His servants in general, but the teachers and ministers of His covenant in particular. There docs not appear to be any allusion to <i>ecclesiastical excommunication</i>.<h2><u><b>14. the light of the world</b>]</u></h2> And yet only in a lower and derivative sense; Christ Himself being “<i>the true light which lighteth every man,</i>” John i. 9; “the light of the world,” viii. 12. His ministers are “<i>candles,</i>” John v. 35, and “lights,” Phil. ii. 15, <i>receiving </i>their light, and only burning <i>for a time</i>: lights <i>lighted</i>, whereas He is Light <i>lighting</i>, as Augustine. And here too, light in this verse = candle in ver. 15, where the comparison is resumed. so also Eph. v. 8:—<b>light</b>, <i>as partaking of His Light</i>: for every thing lighted (see note, ib. ver. 13) is light.<h3><u><b>cannot be hid</b>]</u></h3> Of course it is possible that our Lord may have had <i>some town</i> before Him thus situated, but <i>not Bethulia</i>, whose very existence is probably fabulous, being only mentioned in the apocryphal book of Judith. Recent travellers, as Dr. Stanley and Thomson (Sinai and Palestine, p. 429: The Land and the Book, p. 273), have thought that, notwithstanding the fact shewn by Robinson, that the actual city of Safed was not in existence at this time, some ancient portion of it, at all events its fortress, which is ‘as aged in appearance as the most celebrated ruins in the country’ (Thomson), may have been before the eye of our Lord as He spoke. It is ‘placed high on a bold spur of the Galilean Anti-Lebanon,’ and answers well to the description of a city ‘lying on the mountain top.’ ‘The only other in view would be the village and fortress of Tabor, distinctly visible from the mount of Beatitudes, though not from the hills on the lake side. Either or both of these would<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ucEq9d2-D8rT_xZg7cdRTCqthFQ2qDzL/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But the CHURCH OF GOD, the <i>city on a hill</i> (Isa. ii. 2: Gal. iv. 26: see also Heb. xii. 22), in allusion to their present situation, on a mountain, is most probably leading thought.<h2><u><b>15. do men light</b>]</u></h2> literally, <b>do they light</b>: shewing, in the spiritual reference of the parable, that these lights of the world are ‘<i>lighted</i>’ by Him for whose use they are. See above.<h2><u><b>16. so</b>]</u></h2> i.e. <i>like a candle on a candlestick—like a city on a hill</i>; not merely, ‘so... that,’ as our English version seems rather to imply. By rendering in like manner, the ambiguity will be avoided. The sense of this verse is as if it were “<i>that, seeing your good works they may &c.</i>” . . . the <i>latter </i>verb, and not the former, carrying the purpose of the action. Thus the praise and glory of a well-lighted and brillant feast would be given, not to the lights, but to the master of the house; and of a stately city on a hill, not to the buildings, but to those who built them.<br><br>The whole of this division of our Lord’s sermon is addressed to <i>all His followers</i>, not exclusively to the ministers of his word. All servants of Christ are the salt of the earth, the light of the world (Phil. ii. 15). And all that is here said applies to us all. But à fortiori does it apply in its highest sense, to those who are, among Christians, selected to teach and be examples; who are as it were the towers and pinnacles of the city, not only not hid, but seen far and wide above the rest.<h2><u><b>17—48.</b>]</u></h2><i> The</i> SECOND PART OF THE SERMON, <i>in which our Lord sets forth His relation, as a lawgiver, to the law of Moses, especially as currently interpreted according to the letter only</i><h2><u><b>17. I am come</b>]</u></h2> more properly, <b>I came</b>. Observe how our Lord, through the whole sermon, sets forth Himself, in his proceeding forth from God, as truly “<i>He that was to come.</i>”<h3><u><b>the law, or the prophets</b>]</u></h3> It is a question whether our Lord includes the <i>prophecies</i>, properly so called, in His meaning here. I think <i>not</i>: for no person professing himself to be the Messiah would be thought to <i>contradict the prophecies</i>, but <i>to fulfil them</i>. Neither, it appears, does He <i>here </i>allude to the <i>sacrificial</i> and <i>typical </i>parts of the law, but to the<i> moral</i> parts of both the law and the prophets; which indeed he proceeds to cite and particularize. If however we prefer to include both ceremonial and moral in this assertion, we may understand it in its more general sense, as applying, beyond the instances here given, to His typical fulfilment of the law, which could not as yet be unfolded.<h3><u><b>to fulfil</b>]</u></h3> This verb implies more than the <i>mere fulfilling</i>: it has the sense of <b>filling out</b> or expanding: i.e. here, giving a deeper and holier sense to—fulfilling in the <i>spirit</i>, which is nobler than the letter. Theophylact compares the ancient law to a <i>sketch</i>, which the painter does not wipe out, but fills in. The gnostic Marcion characteristically enough maintained that the Judaizing Christians had altered this verse, and that it originally stood,—think ye that I came to <i>fulfil</i>, &c.? I came to <i>destroy</i>, not to <i>fulfil</i>.<h2><u><b>18. verily</b>]</u></h2> literally, <b>Amen</b>: equivalent to “<i>truly</i>” in St. Luke, ix. 27; xii. 44; xxi. 3. <b>jot (Iota)</b> is the Hebrew Jod, the smallest letter in the alphabet: <b>tittles</b>, literally <b>horns</b>, <i>horn-like projections</i>, are the little turns of the strokes by which one Hebrew letter differs from another similar to it. The Rabbinical writings have many sayings similar in sentiment to this, but spoken of the <i>literal</i> written law.<br><br>It is important to observe in <i>these days</i> how the Lord here <i>includes</i> <i>the O.T. and all its unfolding of the divine purposes regarding Himself, in His teaching</i> of the citizens of the kingdom of heaven. I say this, because it is always in <i>contempt and setting aside of the O.T.</i> that rationalism has begun. First, <i>its historical truth</i>—then <i>its theocratic dispensation</i> and the <i>types </i>and <i>prophecies </i>connected with it, are swept away; so that Christ came to fulfil nothing, and becomes only a teacher or a martyr: and thus the way is paved for a similar rejection of the N.T.;—beginning with the narratives of the birth<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18emL-PLhyMBQMXuSMe-44tMOuDAHuDNm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It should be a maxim for every expositor and every student, that Scripture is a <i>whole</i>, and stands or falls together. That this is now beginning to be deeply felt in Germany, we have cheering testimonies in the later editions of their best Commentators, and in the valuable work of Stier on the discourses of our Lord. [Since however these words were first written, we have had lamentable proof in England, that their warnings were not unneeded. The course of unbelief which has issued in the publication of the volume entitled “ Essays and Reviews,” has been in character and progress, exactly that above described: and owing to the injudicious treatment which has multiplied tenfold the circulation of that otherwise contemptible work, its fallacies are now in the hands and mouths of thousands, who, from the low standard of intelligent Scriptural knowledge among us, will never have the means of answering them. 1862. To this it may now be added, that even a Bishop of the Church of England has come before the world as a champion of that unbelief, in its first phase as described above. We may hope that his work, judging from the blunders already in the renderings of Hebrew words on which his arguments are founded, will soon be added to the catalogue of attacks by which the enemies of our holy faith have damaged nothing save their own reputation and influence. 1863.] <h2><u><b>19.</b>]</u></h2> There is little difficulty in this verse, if we consider it in connexion with the verse preceding, to which it is bound by the <b>therefore </b>and the <b>these</b>, and with the following, to which the <b>for </b>(ver. 20) unites it. Bearing this in mind, we see (1) that <b>break</b>, on account of what follows in ver. 20 and after, must be taken in the higher sense, as referring to the <i>spirit</i> and not the letter: <b>whosoever shall break</b> (have broken), in the sense presently to be laid down. (2) That <b>these least commandments</b> refers to <b>one jot or tittle</b> above, and means one of these minute commands which seem as insignificant, in comparison with the greater, as the <i>jot </i>and <i>tittle </i>in comparison with great portions of writing. (3) That <b>shall be called least</b> does not mean ‘<i>shall be excluded from,</i>” inasmuch as the question is not of <i>keeping or not keeping</i> the commandments of in a legal sense, but of <i>appreciating, and causing others to appreciate</i>, the import and weight of even the most insignificant parts of God’s revelation of Himself to man; and rather therefore applies to teachers than to Christians in general, though to them also through the “<i>break</i>” and “<i>do.</i>” (4) That <i>no deduction can be drawn from these words, binding the Jewish law, or any part of it, as such, upon Christians</i>. That this is so, is plainly shewn by what follows, where our Lord proceeds to pour upon the letter of the law the fuller light of the spirit of the Gospel: thus lifting and expanding (not destroying) every jot and tittle of that precursory dispensation into its fall meaning in the life and practice of the Christian; who, by the indwelling of the divine Teacher, God’s Holy Spirit, is led into all truth and purity. (5) That <i>these words of our Lord are decisive against such persons, </i>whether ancient or modern<i>, as would set aside the Old Testament as without significance, or inconsistent with the New</i>.

" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 97:</a></h3><br>The whole of the rest of our Lord’s sermon is a comment on, and illustration of, the assertion in this verse.<h3><u><b>scribes</b>]</u></h3> Persons devoted to the work of reading and expounding the law, whose office seems first to have become frequent after the return from Babylon. They generally appear in the N.T. in connexion with the Pharisees: but it appears from Acts xxiii. 9, that there were Scribes attached to the other sects also. In Matt. xxi. 15, they appear with the chief priests; but it is in the <i>temple</i>, where (see also Luke xx. 1) they acted as a sort of police. In the description of the assembling of the great Sanhedrim (Matt. xxvi. 3: Mark xiv. 53; xv. 1) we find it composed of c<i>hief priests</i>, <i>elders</i>, and <i>Scribes</i>: and in Luke xxii. 66, of <i>chief priests</i> and <i>Scribes</i>. The Scribes uniformly opposed themselves to our Lord; watching Him to find matter of accusation, Luke vi. 7; xi. 53, 54; perverting His sayings, Matt. ix. 3, and His actions, Luke v. 30; xv. 2; seeking to entangle Him by questions, Matt. xxii. 35 (see note there); Luke x. 25; xx. 21; and to embarrass Him, Matt. xii. 38. Their authority as expounders of the law is recognized by our Lord Himself, Matt. xxiii. 1, 2; their adherence to the oral traditionary exposition proved, Matt. xv. 1 ff.; the respect in which they were held by the people shewn, Luke xx. 46; their existence indicated not only in Jerusalem, but also in Galilee, Luke v. 17,—and in Rome, Josephus, Antt. xviii. 3.5. They kept schools and auditories for teaching the youth, Luke ii. 46; Acts v. 34, compared with xxii. 3; are called by Josephus <i>expounders of our patriarchal laws</i>, Antt. xvii. 6. 2; <i>sophists</i>, B.J. i. 33. 2. The literal rendering is “<b>shall abound more than the Scribes and Pharisees,</b>” i.e. more than that <i>of the S.</i> and <i>P.</i> Notice, that not only the <i>hypocrites </i>among the Scribes and Pharisees are here meant; but the declaration is, “ Your righteousness must be of a <i>higher order</i> than any yet attained, or conceived, by Scribe or Pharisee.”<h3><u><b>ye shall in no case enter, &c.</b>]</u></h3> A very usual formula (see ch. vii. 21; xviii. 3; xix. 17, 23, 24: John iii. 5 al.); implying exclusion from the blessings of the Christian state, and from the inheritance of eternal life.<h2><u><b>21—48.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Six examples of the true</i> FULFILMENT <i>of the law by Jesus</i>.—FIRST EXAMPLE. <i>The law of murder</i>.<h2><u><b>21. Ye have heard</b>]</u></h2> viz. by the reading of the law in the synagogues, and the expositions of the Scribes.<h3><u><b>by them of old time</b>]</u></h3> In this case, Moses and his traditional expounders are classed together; but the words may also be rendered, ‘<i>to</i> the ancients,’—which last interpretation seems to me to be certainly the right one. Meyer has well observed that “it was said to them of old time” corresponds to “but I say to you,” and the “I” to the understood subject of “was said.” He has not, however, apprehended the deeper truth which underlies the omission of the <i>subject </i>of <i>was said</i>, that it was the <i>same person</i> who said both. It will be noticed that our Lord does not here speak against the <i>abuse </i>of the law by tradition, but that every instance here given is either from <i>the law itself</i>, or <i>such traditional teaching as was in accordance with it</i> (e.g. the latter part of this verse is only a formal expansion of the former). The contrasts here are not between <i>the</i> <i>law misunderstood and the law rightly understood</i>, but between the <i>law and its ancient exposition</i>, which in their letter, and as given, were <i>empty</i>,—and <i>the same as spiritualized, fulfilled, by Christ</i>: not between <i>two lawgivers</i>, Moses and Christ, but between <i>they of old time</i> and <i>you</i>; between (the idea is Chrysostom’s) the children by the same husband, of the <i>bondwoman </i>and of the <i>freewoman</i>. The above remarks comprise a brief answer to the important but somewhat misapprehended question, whether a impugned the Mosaic law itself, or only its inadequate interpretation by the Jewish teachers? There is no inconsistency in the above view with the assertion in ver. 19: the just and holy and true law was necessarily restricted in meaning and degraded in position, until He came, whose office it was to fulfil and glorify it.<h3><u><b>the judgment</b>]</u></h3> viz. the courts in every city, ordered Deut. xvi. 18, and explained by Josephus Antt. iv. 8. 14 to consist of seven men, and to have the power of life and death. But “<i>the judgment</i>” in the next verse (see note) is the court of judgment in the Messiah’s kingdom.<br><br><b>23.</b>) The sense is: ‘There were among the Jews three well-known degrees of guilt, coming respectively under the cognizance of the local and the su e courts; and after these is set the Gehenna of fire, the end of the malefactor, whose corpse, thrown out into the valley of Hinnom, was devoured by the worm or the flame.

In the thing compared, the “<i>judgment</i>” inflicted death by the sword, the “<i>council</i>” death by stoning, and the disgrace of the “<i>Gehenna of fire</i>” followed as an intensification of the horrors of death; but the punishment is one and the same—<i>death</i>. So also in the subject of the similitude, <i>all the punishments are spiritual; all result in eternal death; but with various degrees</i> (the nature of which is as yet hidden from us), as the degrees of guilt have been. So that the distinction drawn by the Romanists between <i>venial</i> and mortal sins, finds not only no countenance, but direct confutation from this passage. The words here mentioned must not be superstitiously supposed to have any damning power in themselves (see below), but to represent <i>states of anger and hostility</i>, for which an awful account hereafter must be given.<h3><u><b>Raca</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>empty</b>; a term denoting contempt, and answering to “<i>O vain man,</i>” James ii. 20.<h3><u><b>Moreh</b>]</u></h3> Two interpretations have been given of this interpretations have been given i word. Either it is (1), as usually understood, a Greek word, ‘<i>Thou fool</i>’ and used by our Lord Himself of Scribes and Pharisees, ch. xxiii. 17, 19,—and “<i>fools</i>” (literally “<i>senseless</i>”) of the disciples, Luke xxiv. 25; or (2) a Hebrew word signifying ‘<i>rebel,</i>’ and the very word for uttering which Moses and Aaron were debarred from entering the land of promise: ... ‘Hear now, ye rebels,’ Num. xx.10. In presence of this doubt, it is best to leave the word untranslated, as was done with <b>Raca</b> before.<h3><u><b>hell fire</b>]</u></h3> more properly, <b>the Gehenna of fire</b>. To the S.E. of Jerusalem was a deep and fertile valley, called ‘<i>the vale of Hinnom</i>’ and rendered “Gehenna,” Josh xviii. 16 LXX. In this valley (also called Tophet, Isa. xxx. 33: Jer. vii. 31) did the idolatrous Jews burn their children to Moloch, and Josiah (2 Kings xxiii. 10) therefore polluted it; and thenceforward it was the place for the casting out and burning all offal, and the corpses of criminals; and therefore its name, “<i>the Gehenna of fire,</i>” was used to signify the place of everlasting punishment.<h2><u><b>23 f. Therefore</b>]</u></h2> An inference from the guilt and danger of all bitterness and hostility of mind towards another declared in the preceding verse.<br><br><b>thy gift</b>, is any kind of gift—sacrificial or eucharistic.<br><br><b>hath ought against thee</b> is remarkable, as being purposely substituted for the converse. It is not <i>what complaints we have against others</i> that we are to consider at such a time, but <i>what they have against us</i>; not what ground <i>we have given</i> for complaint, but what complaints <i>they</i>, as matter of fact, <i>make </i>against us.—See the other side dealt with, Mark xi. 25.<h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> <b>be reconciled</b>: i.e. <b>become reconciled</b> —<i>thyself</i>, without being influenced by the status of the other towards thee. Remove the offence, and make friendly overtures to thy brother. <b>first </b>belongs to “<i>go thy way,</i>” not to “<i>be reconciled:</i>” “first go thy way” is opposed to “then come,” the <i>departure</i> to the <i>return</i>, not “be reconciled” to “offer.” No conclusion whatever can be drawn from this verse as to the admissibility of the term <i>altar </i>as applied to the Lord’s table under the Christian system. The whole language is Jewish, and can only be understood of Jewish rites. The <i>command</i>, of course, applies in full force as to reconciliation re the Christian offering of praise and thanksgiving in the Holy Communion; but further nothing can be inferred.<h2><u><b>25.</b>]</u></h2> The whole of this verse is the earthly example of a spiritual duty which is understood, and runs parallel with it. The sense may be given: ‘As in worldly affairs, it is prudent to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nXNZpPvgXiyn4x927gezCY3NbdJ6bgBt/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The <b>way</b>, in the interpretation, is the way in which all men walk, the “<i>way of all the earth</i>” of 1 Kings ii. 2, the “<i>way whence I shall not return</i>” of Job. xvi. 22. In the civil process, it represents the attempt at arbitration or private arrangement before coming into court.<h2><u><b>26.</b>]</u></h2> These words, as in the earthly example they imply future liberation, because an earthly debt can be paid in most cases, so in the spiritual counterpart they amount to a negation of it, because the debt can never be discharged. We have “<i>until he should pay what was due,</i>” in ch, xviii. 30, where the payment was clearly impossible. The minister is the officer of the court who saw the sentences executed. If we are called on to assign a meaning to it in the interpretation, it must represent the chief of those who in ch. xviii. 34, are hinted at by “<i>the tormentors,</i>” viz, the great enemy, the minister of the divine wrath.<br><br><b>farthing</b>, the fourth of an <i>as</i>.<h2><u><b>27—30.</b>]</u></h2> SECOND EXAMPLE. <i>The law of adultery</i>.<h2><u><b>28. whosoever looketh ..</b>]</u></h2> The precise meaning should in this verse be kept in mind, as the neglect of it may lead into error. Our Lord is speaking of the sin of <i>adultery</i>, and therefore, however the saying may undoubtedly apply by implication to cases where this sin is out of the question—e. g. to the impure beholding of an <i>un</i>married woman with a view to fornication (it being borne in mind that spiritually, and before God, all fornication <i>is</i> adultery, inasmuch as the unmarried person is bound in loyalty and chastity to <i>Him</i>: see Stier below)—yet the <i>direct </i>assertion in this verse must be understood as applying to the cases where <i>this </i>sin is in question. And, again, the <b>looketh on... to lust after</b>, must not be interpreted of the casual evil thought which is checked by holy watchfulness, but the gazing <i>with a view to feed that desire</i>. And again, <b>hath adulterously used her already in his heart</b>, whatever it may undoubtedly <i>imply </i>respecting the guilt incurred in God’s sight, does not <i>directly state</i> any thing; but plainly understood, affirms that the man who can do this—viz. ‘gaze with a view to feed unlawful desire ’—has already in his heart passed the barrier of criminal intention; made up his mind, stifled his conscience; in thought, committed the deed. But perhaps there is justice in Stier’s remark, that our Lord speaks here after the O.T. usage, in which, both in the seventh commandment and elsewhere, <i>adultery </i>also <i>includes fornication</i>; for marriage is the becoming one flesh,—and therefore every such union, except that after the manner and in the state appointed by God, is a violation and contempt of that holy ordinance. The rendering of the A. V., “<i>hath committed adultery with her,</i>” is objectionable, as making her a party to the sin, which the original does not.<h2><u><b>29.</b>]</u></h2> Chrysostom observes, that these commands relate not to the limbs themselves, which are not in fault, but to the evil desire, which <i>is</i>. An admonition, arising out of the truth announced in the last verse, to <i>withstand the first springs and occasions of evil desire, even by the sacrifice of what is most useful and dear to us</i>. We may observe here, that our Lord grounds His precept of the most rigid and decisive <i>self-denial</i> on the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qC4V3G1BKImnybgUqH_DUischAieDIGz/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

See ch. xviii. 8, 9, and notes. <b>31 32.</b>] THIRD EXAMPLE. <i>The law of divorce</i>. See note on ch. xix. 7–9. Lightfoot gives a form of the “<i>writing of divorcement</i>” which was a divorcement a <i>mensâ et thoro</i>, and placed the woman absolutely in her own power, to marry whom she pleased. In Deut. xxiv. 1, the allowable reason of divorce is ‘some uncleanness.’ This the disciples of Shammai interpreted only of adultery; those of Hillel of any thing which amounted to uncleanness in the eyes of the husband.<h2><u><b>32.</b>]</u></h2> <b>fornication</b> must be taken to mean sin, not only before marriage, but after it also, in a wider sense, as including <i>adultery</i> likewise. In the similar places, Mark x. 11; Luke xvi. 18, this exception does not occur; see however our ch. xix. 9. The figurative senses of <i>fornication</i> cannot be admissible here, as the law is one having reference to a definite point in actual life; and this, its aim and end, restricts the meaning to that kind of fornication immediately applicable to the case. Otherwise this one strictly guarded exception would give indefinite and universal latitude.<h3><u><b>causeth her to commit adultery</b>]</u></h3> viz. by her second marriage, thus put within her power.<h3><u><b>and whosoever</b>]</u></h3> How far <i>the marriage of the innocent party after separation</i> (on account of fornication) is <i>forbidden </i>by this or the similar passage ch. xix. 9, is a weighty and difficult question. By the Roman Church such marriage is <i>strictly forbidden</i>, and the authority of Augustine much cited, who strongly upholds this view, but not without misgivings later in life. On the other hand, the Protestant and Greek Churches <i>allow</i> such marriage. Certainly it would appear, from the literal meaning of our Lord’s words, that it <i>should not be allowed</i>: for if by such divorce the marriage be altogether dissolved, how can the <i>woman</i> be said to commit adultery by a second marriage? or how will St. Paul’s precept (1 Cor. vii. 11) find place? for stating this as St. Paul does, prefaced by the words “<i>not I, but the Lord,</i>” it must be understood, and has been taken, as <i>referring to this very verse</i>, or rather (see note there) to ch. xix. 6 ff., and consequently can only suppose fornication as the cause. Besides which, the tenor of our Lord’s teaching in other places (see above) seems to set before us the state of marriage as absolutely <i>indissoluble as such</i>, however he may sanction the expulsion <i>a mensâ et thoro</i> of an unfaithful wife. Those who defend the other view suppose <b>divorced</b> to mean, <i>unlawfully divorced</i>, not for fornication: and certainly this is not improbable. We may well leave a matter in doubt, of which Augustine could say, that it was so obscure, that error on either side is venial.<h2><u><b>33—37.</b>]</u></h2> FOURTH EXAMPLE. <i>The law of oaths</i>.<h2><u><b>33, 34.</b>]</u></h2> The exact meaning of these verses is to be ascertained by two considerations. (1) That the Jews held all those oaths <i>not to be binding</i>, in which the <i>sacred name of God did not directly occur</i>:—see Philo and Lightfoot cited in my Gr. Test. A stress is to be laid on this technical distinction in the quotation made by our Lord; and we must understand as belonging to the quotation, ‘but whatever thou shalt swear not to the Lord may be transgressed.’ (2) Then our Lord passes so far beyond this rule, that He lays down (including in it the understanding that all oaths must, be kept <i>if made</i>, for that they are all<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hnb6ngZ1IFzhDO8Q1rnjDwt0k555HbSc/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 101:</a></h3><br>Ultimately referable to swearing by God) the rule of the Christian community, which is <i>not to swear at all</i>; for that every such means of strengthening a man’s simple affirmation arises out of the evil in human nature, is rendered requisite by the distrust that sin has induced, and is, therefore, out of the question among the just and true and pure of heart. See James v. 12, and note there, as explanatory why, in both cases, swearing by the name of God is not specified as forbidden. In the words, ‘Swear not at all,’ our Lord does not so much make a positive enactment by which all swearing is to individuals forbidden, e.g. on solemn occasions, and for the satisfaction of others, (for that would be a mere technical Pharisaism, wholly at variance with the spirit of the Gospel, and inconsistent with the example of <i>God himself</i>, Heb. vi. 13–17; vii. 21; <i>of the Lord when on earth, whose “verily verily I say unto you”</i> was a solemn asseveration, and who at once respected the solemn adjuration of Caiaphas, ch. xxvi. 63, 64; of <i>His Apostles</i>, writing under the guidance of His Spirit, see Gal. i. 20: 2 Cor. i. 23: Rom. i. 9: Phil. i. 8, and especially 1 Cor. xv. 31; of <i>His holy angels</i>, Rev. x. 6,) as declare to us, that the <i>proper state</i> of Christians is, to <i>require no oaths</i>; that when <i>evil</i> is expelled from among them, every <i>yea </i>and <i>nay </i>will be as decisive as an oath, every promise as binding as a vow. We observe (<i>a</i>) that these verses imply the unfitness of <i>vows </i>of every kind as rules of Christian action; (<i>b</i>) that the greatest regard ought to be had to the scruples of those, not only sects, but individuals, who object to taking an oath, and every facility given in a Christian state for their ultimate entire abolition.<h2><u><b>34, 35.</b>]</u></h2> Compare ch. xxiii. 16–22. Dean Trench observes (Serm. on Mount, p. 55), ‘Men had learned to think that, if only God’s name were avoided, there was no irreverence in the frequent oaths by heaven, by the earth, by Jerusalem, by their own heads, and these brought in on the slightest need, or on no need at all; just - as now-a-days the same lingering half-respect for the Holy Name will often cause men, who would not be wholly profane, to substitute for that name sounds that nearly resemble, but are not exactly it, or the name, it may be, of some heathen deity.’<h2><u><b>36.</b>]</u></h2> Thou hast no control over the appearance of grey hairs on thy head—thy head is not thine own;—thou swearest then by a creature of God, whose destinies and changes are in God’s hand; so that <i>every oath is an appeal to God</i>. And, indeed, men generally regard it as such now, even unconsciously.<h3><u><b>Yea, yea; Nay, nay</b>]</u></h3> The similar place, James v. 12, admirably illustrates this— “<i>let your yea be yea, and your nay nay:</i>” —let these only be used, and they in simplicity and unreservedness.<h3><u><b>cometh of evil</b>]</u></h3> The gender of evil is ambiguous, as it may be also in the Lord’s prayer, ch. vi, 13: but see note there. It is quite immaterial to the <i>sense</i>, in which gender we understand it; for the evil of man’s corrupt nature is in Scripture spoken of as the <i>work of “the evil One,”</i> and is <i>itself “that which is evil.”</i> See John viii. 44: 1 John iii. 8.<h2><u><b>38—41.</b>]</u></h2> FIFTH EXAMPLE. <i>The law of retaliation</i>.<h2><u><b>38.</b>]</u></h2> That is, <i>such was the public enactment of the Mosaic law</i>, and, as such, it implied a private spirit of retaliation which should seek such redress; for the example evidently refers to <i>private </i>as well as public retribution. Here again our Lord appears to speak of the <i>true state and perfection of a Christian community</i>,—not to forbid, in those mixed and but half-Christian states, which have ever divided so-called Christendom among them, the infliction of judicial penalties for crime. In fact Scripture speaks, Rom. xiii. 4, of <i>the minister of such infliction</i> as the <i>minister</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xex2DM0KXd4cFcOs-UGP6u9CZySggbDB/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But as before, our Lord shews us the <i>condition to which</i> a Christian community should <i>tend</i>, and to further which every private Christian’s own endeavours should be directed. It is quite beside the purpose for the world to say, that these precepts of our Lord are too highly pitched for humanity, and so to find an excuse for violating them. If we were disciples of His in the true sense, these would, in their <i>spirit</i>, as indicative of frames of mind, be <i>strictly observed</i>; and, <i>as far</i> as we are His disciples, we shall <i>attain to such their observance</i>.<br><br>Here again, our Lord does not <i>contradict</i> the Mosaic law, but <i>expands</i> and <i>fulfils</i> it, declaring to us that the necessity for it would be altogether removed in the complete state of that kingdom which He came to establish.<br><br>Against the notion that <b>an eye for an eye</b> &c. sanctioned all kinds of private revenge, Augustine remarks that the ancient precept was rather intended to allay, than to stimulate anger; as a limit to vindictiveness, not a licence.<h2><u><b>39.</b>]</u></h2> Here again, we have our divine Lawgiver legislating, not in the bondage of the letter, so as to stultify His disciples, and in many circumstances to turn the salt of the earth into a means of corrupting it,—but in the freedom of the spirit, laying down those great principles which ought to regulate the inner purposes and consequent actions of His followers. Taken <i>slavishly </i>and <i>literally</i>, neither did our Lord Himself conform to this precept (John xviii. 22, 23), nor His Apostles (Acts xxiii. 3). But <i>truly</i>, and in the <i>spirit</i>, our blessed Redeemer obeyed it: ‘He gave his back to the smiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, and hid not his face from shame and spitting’ (Isa. 1. 6): and his Apostles also, see 1 Cor. iv. 9–13.<h3><u><b>evil</b>]</u></h3> i.e. here <b>the evil man</b>; ‘him who injures thee.’ Or, perhaps, in the indefinite sense, as before, <b>evil</b>, generally, ‘when thus directed against thee.’ Only, the other possible meaning there, ‘<i>the evil One,</i>’ is precluded here. “<i>Resist the devil,</i>” James iv. 7: but not <i>this particular form</i> of his working (viz. malice directed against thyself) so as to revenge it on another.<h2><u><b>40, 41.</b>]</u></h2>: See note on ver. 39. This is of <i>legal contention only</i>, and is thus distinguished from the violence in ver. 39.<br><br><b>take away</b>, i.e. in pledge for a debt: see Exod. xxii. 6.<br><br><b>coat</b>, the inner and less costly garment; <b>cloke</b>, the outer and more valuable, used also by the poor as a coverlet by night (Exod. as above). In Luke vi. 29 the order is inverted , and appears to be that in which the two garments would be taken from the body, that verse referring to abstraction by <i>violence</i>. See the apostolic comment on this precept, 1 Cor. vi. 7.<h3><u><b>compel</b>]</u></h3> The original word is one derived from the Persian name of the post-couriers who carried the government despatches: and is thence used of any compulsory “<i>pressing</i>” to go on service. ‘The Jews particularly objected to the duty of furnishing posts for the Roman government; and Demetrius, wishing to conciliate the Jews, promised, among other things, that their beasts of burden should not be pressed for service. Hence our Saviour represents this as a burden.’ Josephus. The billeting of the Roman soldiers and their horses on the Jews was one kind of this compulsion.<h2><u><b>42.</b>]</u></h2> The proper understanding of the command in this verse may be arrived at from considering the way in which the Lord Himself, who declares, ‘If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it’ (John xiv. 14), performs this promise to us. It would obviously be, not a promise of love, but a sentence of condemnation to us, understood in its bare literal sense; but our gracious Saviour, knowing what is good for us, so answers our prayers, that we never are sent empty away; not always, indeed, receiving <i>what </i>we ask,—but that which, in the very disappointment, we are constrained thankfully to confess is better than our wish. So, in his humble sphere, should the Christian giver act. To give every thing to every one—the sword to the madman, the alms to the impostor, the criminal request to the temptress— would be to act as the enemy of others<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1co_tiKJ-Yo4Vhm4aVnugyo-s4ItI0FIk/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But our Lord’s ‘<i>fulfilment</i>’ of neighbourly love extends it to all mankind—not only foreign nations, but even those who are actively employed in cursing, reviling, and persecuting us; and the hating of enemies is, in His <i>fulfilment</i> of it, no longer an individual or national aversion, but a coming out and being separate from all that rebel.<h2><u><b>45. sons</b>]</u></h2> i.e. in being <i>like Him</i>. Of course there is allusion to our <i>state of children by covenant and adoption</i>; but the <i>likeness </i>is the point especially here brought out. So <i>imitators of God</i>, Eph. v. 1. The more we lift ourselves above the world’s view of the duty and expediency of revenge and exclusive dealing, into the mind with which the ‘righteous Judge, strong and patient, who is provoked every day,’ yet does good to the unthankful and evil,—the more firmly shall we assure, and the more nobly illustrate, our place as sons in His family, as <i>having entered into the kingdom of heaven</i>.<h3><u><b>for</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>because</b>, ‘in that:’ gives the particular in which the conformity implied by “<i>sons</i>” consists. There is a sentiment of Seneca remarkably parallel: “If thou wouldest imitate the gods, confer benefits even on the ungrateful: for the sun rises on the wicked as well as on others, and the seas are open for pirates’ use.”<h2><u><b>46. publicans</b>]</u></h2> This race of men, so frequently mentioned as the objects of hatred and contempt among the Jews, and coupled with sinners, were not properly the <i>publicans</i>, who were wealthy Romans, the rank of knights, farming the revenues of the provinces; but their underlings, heathens or renegade Jews, who usually exacted with recklessness and cruelty. “The Talmud classes them with thieves and assassins, and regards their repentance as impossible.” Wordsw. In interpreting these verses we must carefully give the persons spoken of their correlative value and meaning: <b>ye</b>, Christians, sons of God, the true theocracy, the <i>Kingdom of heaven</i>,—these, “<i>publicans</i>” or “<i>Gentiles</i>,” men of this world, actuated by worldly motives,— ‘what thank have <i>ye</i> in being like <i>them</i>?’<h2><u><b>47. salute</b>]</u></h2> Here, most probably in its literal sense, Jews did not salute Gentiles: Mohammedans do not salute Christians even now in the East.<h2><u><b>48.

No countenance is given by this verse to the ancient Pelagian or the modern heresy of perfectibility in this life. Such a sense of the words would be utterly at variance with the whole of the discourse. See especially vv. 22, 29, 32, in which the imperfections and conflicts of the Christian are fully recognized. Nor, if we consider this verse as a solemn conclusion of the second part of the Sermon, does it any the more admit of this view, asserting as it does that likeness to God in inward purity, love, and holiness, must be the continual aim and end of the Christian in all the departments of his moral life. But how far from having attained this likeness we are, St. Paul shews us (Phil. iii, 12); and every Christian feels, just <i>in the proportion in which he has striven after it</i>.<h1><u><b>CHAP. VI. 1–18.</b>]</u></h1> <i>The</i> THIRD DIVISION OF the SERMON, <i>in which the disciples of Christ are warned against hypocritical display of their good deeds, by the examples of abuses of the duties of almsgiving</i> (ver. 2), <i>praying</i> (ver. 5), <i>and fasting</i> (ver. 16).<h2><u><b>1.</b>]</u></h2> The discourse of our Lord now passes <i>from actions to motives</i>; not that He has not spoken to the heart before, but then it was only by inference, now directly.<h3><u><b>righteousness</b>]</u></h3> not <i>‘benevolence</i>,’ or <i>‘alms</i>,’ as in rabbinical usage,—for this meaning is never found in the N.T., and here we have <b>doing alms</b> treated of as a distinct head below. It is best then to understand <b>righteousness </b>as in ch. v. 20, as a general term, including the three duties afterwards treated of.<br><br>The words <b>to be seen of</b> (by) <b>them </b>clearly define the course of action objected to:—not the open benevolence of the Christian who lets his light shine that men may glorify God, but the ostentation of him whose <i>object </i>is the praise and glory coming from man. “For,” says Chrysostom, “a man may do his good deeds before men, but not in order to be seen by them; and a man may do them not before men, but in order to be seen by them.”<h2><u><b>2–4,</b>]</u></h2> FIRST EXAMPLE. <i>Almsgiving</i>.<h2><u><b>2. sound a trumpet</b>]</u></h2> A proverbial expression, not implying any such custom of the hypocrites of that day, -but the habit of self-laudation, and display of good works in general. Many Commentators, among whom are Calvin and Bengel, think that the words are to be taken literally: and Euthymins mentions this view. But Lightfoot says, that he finds no trace of such a practice among the customs in almsgiving.<h3><u><b>before thee</b>]</u></h3> According to the way in which the former verse is taken, these words are variously understood to apply to the trumpet being <i>held up before the mouth in blowing, or to another person going before</i>.<h3><u><b>synagogues</b>]</u></h3> If this bears the ordinary meaning of places of worship, the literal meaning of the previous words cannot well be maintained. The synagogues, as afterwards the Christian churches, were the regular places for the collection of alms.<h3><u><b>have</b>]</u></h3> literally, <b>have in full,— exhaust</b>: not <i>have </i>their <i>due reward</i>.<h2><u><b>3.</b>]</u></h2> thy, emphatic: see ch. v. 48. This is another popular saying, not to be pressed so as to require a literal interpretation of it in the act of almsgiving, but implying simplicity, both of intention and act. Equally out of place are all attempts to explain the right and left hand symbolically, as was once the practice. The sound sense of Chrysostom preserves the right interpretation, where even Augustine strays into symbolism.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyV7BnYSv25y4P0z5YhLUk4QuFRle2fC/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

See 1 Sam. i. 26: 1 Kings viii. 22. The command in Mark (xi. 25) runs, “<i>when ye stand praying</i> ...” See also Luke xviii. 11, 13. Indeed, of the two positions of prayer, considering the place, kneeling would have been the more singular and savouring of ostentation. The <i>synagogues </i>were <i>places of prayer</i>; so that, as Theophylact, it is not the <i>place </i>which matters, but the <i>manner </i>and <i>intent</i>.<h2><u><b>6. enter, &c.</b>]</u></h2> Both Chrysostom and Augustine caution us against taking this merely literally: and warn us, as above, that there may ostentation even in the secret chamber, as there may be the avoiding of it in the open church.<h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> On the original meaning of the word rendered “<i>use vain repetitions,</i>” see in my Gr. Test. Taking the word in its largest meaning, that of <i>saying things irrelevant and senseless</i>, it may well include all the various senses contended for. What is forbidden is not <i>much </i>praying, for our Lord Himself seed whole nights in prayer: not praying <i>in the same words</i>, for this He did in the very intensity of His agony at Gethsemane; but the making number and length a <i>point of observance</i>, and imagining that prayer will be heard, not because it is the genuine expression of the desire of faith, but because it is of <i>such a length</i>, has been <i>such a number of times</i> repeated. The repetitions of Paternosters and Ave Marias in the Romish Church, as <i>practised</i> by them, are <i>in direct violation</i> of this precept; the <i>number </i>of repetitions being <i>prescribed</i>, and the <i>efficacy of the performance made to depend on it</i>. But the repetition of the Lord’s Prayer in the Liturgy of the Church of England is not a violation of it, nor that of the Kyrie Eleison, because it is not the number of these which is the object, but each has its <i>appropriate place</i> and <i>reason</i> in that which is pre-eminently a reasonable service. Our Lord was also denouncing a <i>Jewish</i> error. Lightfoot quotes from the Rabbinical writings, “<i>Every one who multiplies prayer, is heard.</i>”<h2><u><b>9—13.</b>]</u></h2> THE LORD’S PRAYER.<h2><u><b>9.</b>]</u></h2> There is very slender proof of what is often asserted, that our Lord took nearly the whole of this prayer from existing Jewish formalæ. Not that such a view of the matter would contain in it any thing irreverent or objectionable; for if pious Jews had framed such petitions, our Lord, who came to fulfil every thing that was good under the Old Covenant, might, in a higher sense and spiritual meaning, have recommended the same forms to His disciples. But such does not appear to have been the fact. Lightfoot produces only the most general common-place parallels for the petitions, from the Rabbinical books.<br><br>With regard to the prayer itself<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qYnetLJce71n7HTS2MqwhHbZgXIYCCLK/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The whole passage, vv. 7–15, is digressive from the subject of the first part of this chapter, which is the discouragement of the performance of religious duties to be seen of men, and is resumed at ver. 16. Neander therefore supposes that this passage has found its way in here as a sort of accompaniment to the preceding verses, but is in reality the answer of our Lord to the request in Luke xi. 1, more fully detailed than by that Evangelist. But to this I cannot assent, believing our Lord’s discourses as given by this evangelist to be no collections of scattered sayings, but veritable reports of continuous utterances. That the request related in Luke should afterwards have been made, and similarly answered, is by no means improbable. (That he should have thus related it <i>with this gospel before him</i>, is more than improbable.) 2. It has been questioned whether the prayer was led in the very earliest times as a set form delivered for liturgical use by our Lord. The variations in Luke have been regarded as fatal to the supposition of its being used liturgically at the time when these Gospels were written. But see notes on Luke xi. 1. It must be confessed, that we find very few traces of such use in early times. Tholuck remarks, “It does not occur in the Acts, nor in any writers before the third century. In Justin Martyr we find, that the minister prays ‘according to his power’... Cyprian and Tertullian make the first mention of the prayer as a ‘<i>lawful and ordinary prayer.</i>’” An allusion to it has been supposed to exist in 2 Tim. iv. 18, where see note. 3. The view of some that our Lord gave this, selecting it out of forms known and in use, as a prayer <i>ad interim, till the effusion of the Spirit of prayer</i>, is inadmissible, as we have no traces of any such temporary purpose in our Saviour’s discourses, and to suppose any such would amount to nothing less than to set them entirely aside. On the contrary, one work of the Holy Spirit on the disciples was, to <i>bring to their mind all things whatsoever He said unto them</i>, the depth of such sayings only then first being revealed to them by Him who <i>took of the things of Christ and shewed them to them</i>, John xiv. 26.<h3><u><b>After this manner</b>]</u></h3> <b>thus</b>. Considering that other manners of praying have been spoken of above, the “<i>vain repetition</i>” and the “<i>much speaking,</i>” the word, especially in its present position of primary emphasis, cannot well be otherwise understood than ‘<i>in these words,</i>’ as a <i>specimen </i>of the <i>Christian’s </i>prayer (the <b>ye</b> holds the second place in emphasis), no less than its <i>pattern</i>. This, which would be the <i>inference </i>from the context here, is decided tor us by Luke xi. 2, <b>when ye pray, say—.</b><h3><u><b>Our Father</b>]</u></h3> This was a form of address almost unknown to the Old Covenant: now and then hinted at, as reminding the children of their rebellion (Isa. i. 2: Mal. i. 6), or mentioned as a last resource of the orphan and desolate creature (Isa. lxiii. 16) ; but never brought out in its fulness, as indeed it could not be, till He was come by whom we have received the adoption of sons. “The prayer is a fraternal one; He saith not, <b>My</b> Father, as if prayed for himself only: bat Our Father, as embracing in one prayer all who are known as brethren in Christ.” Aug.<h3><u><b>which art in heaven</b>]</u></h3> These opening words of the Lord’s Prayer set clearly before us the state of the Christian, as believing in, depending upon, praying to, a real <i>objective personal</i> GOD, lifted above himself; to approach whom he must lift up his heart, as the eye is lifted up from earth to heaven. This strikes at the root of all <i>pantheistic </i>error, which regards the spirit of man as identical with the Spirit of God,—and at the root of all <i>deism</i>, testifying us it does our relation to and covenant dependence on our heavenly Father.<br><br>The <i>local heavens</i> are no farther to be thought of here, than as Scripture, by a parallelism of things natural and spiritual deeply implanted in our race, universally speaks of <i>heaven </i>and <i>heavenly</i>, as applying to the habitation and perfections of the High and Holy One who inhabiteth Eternity.<h3><u><b>Hallowed be thy name</b>]</u></h3> De Wette observes: ‘God’s ‘Name is not merely His appellation, which we speak- with the mouth, but also and principally the idea which we attach to it, —His Being, as far as it is confessed, revealed, or known.’ The ‘Name of God’ in Scripture is used to signify that revelation of Himself which He has made to men, which is all that we know of Him: into the depths of His Being, as it is, no human soul can penetrate. Soe John xvii. 6: Rom. ix. 17. <b>Hallow </b>here is in the sense of <b>keep holy, sanctify in our hearts</b>, as in ref. 1 Pet.<h2><u><b>10.

Meyer, in objecting to all ecclesiastical and spiritual meanings of ‘Thy kingdom,’ forgets that the one for which he contends exclusively, <i>the Messianic kingdom</i>, does in fact include or imply them all.<h3><u><b>Thy will be done</b>]</u></h3> i.e. not, ‘may our will be absorbed into thy will ;’ but may it be conformed to and subordinated to thine. The literal rendering is, <b>Let thy will be done, as in heaven</b>, (so) <b>also on earth</b>.<br><br>These last words, “<i>as in heaven, so also on earth,</i>” may be regarded as applying to the whole of the three preceding petitions, as punctuated in the text. A slight objection may perhaps be found in the circumstance, that the kingdom of God cannot be said to have <i>come </i>in heaven, seeing that it has always been fully established there, and thus the accuracy of correspondence in the particulars will be marred. It is true, this may be escaped by understanding, May thy kingdom <i>come </i>on earth, so as to be as fully established, as it is already in heaven. So that I conceive we are at liberty to take the prayer either way.<h2><u><b>11. our daily bread</b>]</u></h2> <b>our—as </b>‘<i>created for us,</i>’ ‘provided for our use by Thee.’ The word rendered <b>daily </b>has been very variously explained. For a discus- sion of the probable derivations and meanings, I must refer to my Gr. Test. I have there seen reason to prefer the sense <b>required for our subsistence—proper for our sustenance</b>. So that the expression will be equivalent to St. James’s “<i>things which are needful for the body</i>” (ii. 16), and the expressions are rendered in the Syriac version by the same word. Thus only, <b>this day</b> has its proper meaning. The <i>“day by day</i>” in Luke xi. 3 is different; see there. It is a question, how far the expression may be understood <i>spiritually</i>—of the Bread of Life. The answer is easy: viz. that we may safely thus understand it, provided we keep in the foreground its primary, physical meaning, and view the other as involved by implication in that. To understand the expression of the Eucharist <i>primarily</i>, or even of spiritual feeding on Christ, is to miss the plain reference of the petition to our daily physical wants. But not to recognize those spiritual senses, is equally to miss the great truth, that the “<i>we</i>” whose bread is prayed for, are not <i>mere </i>animals, but com; of body, soul, and spirit, all of which want daily nourishment by Him from whom all blessings flow.<h3><u><b>our debts</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>sins</b>, short-comings, and therefore ‘debts:’ answers to “<i>trespasses,</i>” ver. 14. Augustine remarks, that those sins are not meant which are remitted in the regeneration of baptism, but those which are contracted day by day from the bitter fruits of worldly contact by our infirmity.<h3><u><b>as we</b>]</u></h3> Not ‘<i>for</i> we also,’ &c. (as in Luke), nor ‘<i>in the same measure as we also,</i>’ &c., but <b>like as we also</b>, &c.; implying similarity in the two actions, of kind, but no comparison of degree. ‘Augustine uses the testimony of this prayer against all proud Pelagian notions of an absolutely sinless state in this life’ (Trench); and answers the various excuses and evasions by which that sect escaped from the conclusion.<br><br><b>have forgiven</b> here implies that (see ch. v. 23, 24) the act of forgiveness of others is <i>completed before we approach</i> the throne ofgrace.<h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> The sentiment is not in any way inconsistent with the Christian’s joy when he “<i>falls into divers temptations,</i>” James i. 2, but is a humble self-distrust and shrinking from such trial in the prospect. The <b>leading into temptation</b> must be understood in its plain literal sense: so <i>will make with the temptation also a way to escape</i>, 1 Cor. x. 13. There is no discrepancy with James i. 13, which speaks not of the providential bringing about of, but the actual solicitation of, the temptation. Some have attempted to fix on <i>leading into</i> and <i>entering into</i> temptation, the meaning of <i>bringing into the power of</i>, and <i>entering into, so as to be overcome by</i>, temptation. But this surely the words will not bear.<br><br><b>But</b> must not be taken as equivalent to ‘<i>but if thou dost, deliver,</i>’ &c.; but is rather the opposition to the former clause, and forms in this sense, but one petition with it,—‘b<i>ring us not into conflict with evil, nay rather deliver (rid) us from it altogether</i>’ In another view, however, as expressing the deep desire of all Christian hearts to be delivered from <i>all evil</i> (for the adjective is here certainly<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQNMQgPNnqASU9uq_ULedh-Z7qUX2fqM/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Besides, compare the words of St. Paul, 2 Tim. iv. 18, which look very like a reminiscence of this prayer: see note there) these words form a seventh and most affecting petition, reaching far beyond the last. They are the expression of the yearning for redemption of the sons of God (Rom. viii. 28), and so are fitly placed at the end of the prayer, and as the sum and substance of the personal petitions.<br><br>The <i>doxology </i>must on every ground of sound criticism be omitted. Had it formed part of the original text, it is absolutely inconceivable that almost all the ancient authorities should with one consent have omitted it. They could have had no reason for doing so; whereas the habit of terminating liturgical prayers with ascriptions of praise would naturally suggest some such ending, and make its insertion almost certain in course of time. And just correspondent to this is the evidence. We find, <i>absolutely no trace of it in early times</i>, in any family of MSS. or in any expositors. The ancient Syriac version <i>has </i>it, but whether it <i>always had</i>, is another question. It is quite open for us to regard it with Euthymius as “<i>a solemn ending, added by the holy lights and leaders of the Church,</i>” and to retain it as such in our liturgies; but in dealing with the sacred text we must not allow any <i>à priori</i> considerations, of which we are such poor judges, to outweigh the almost unanimous testimony of antiquity. The inference to be drawn from the words of St. Paul, 2 Tim. iv. 18, is rather against, than for the genuineness of the doxology. The fact that he there adds a doxology, different from that commonly read here, seems to<br><br>testify to the practice, begun thus early, of concluding the Lord’s prayer with a solemn ascription of glory to God. This eventually fell into one conventional form, and thus got inserted in the sacred text.<h2><u><b>14, 15</b>]</u></h2> Our Lord returns (<b>for</b>) to explain the only part of the prayer which <i>peculiarly</i> belonged to the new law of Jove, and enforces it by a solemn assurance. On the sense, see Mark xi. 25, and the remarkable parallel, Ecclesiasticus xxviii. 2: “ <i>orgive thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done unto thee, so shall thy sins also be forgiven when thou prayest.</i>”<br><br><b>16—18.</b>) THIRD EXAMPLE. <i>Fasting</i>. Another department of the spiritual life, in which <i>reality in the sight of God</i>, and not appearance in the sight of man, must be our object. While these verses determine nothing as to the manner and extent of Christian fasting, they clearly recognize it as a solemn duty, ranking it with almsgiving and prayer; but requiring it, like them, (see ch. ix. 14–17,) to spring out of reality, not mere formal prescription.<h2><u><b>16. disfigure</b>]</u></h2> The word literally means <i>make to disappear</i>. Hence some have explained it, <i>hide, cover up</i>, viz. in mourning costume. But in later Greek the meaning was to <i>disfigure</i>. One writer uses it of women who paint their faces. The allusion is therefore not to <i>covering</i> the face, which could only be regarded as a sign of <i>mourning</i>, but to the squalor of the uncleansed face, and hair of the head and beard, as the contrast of washing and anointing shews.<h2><u><b>17.</b>]</u></h2> i.e. ‘<i>appear as usual:</i>’ ‘seem to men the same as if thou wert not fasting.’ It has been observed that this precept applies only to voluntary and private fasts, (such as are mentioned Luke xviii. 12,) not to public and enjoined ones. But this distinction<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i5BLFioOdro89PudlX97xjPu7Nak-EIp/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In this section this is enjoined, 1. (vv. 19– 24) with regard to earthly <i>treasures</i>, from the impossibility of serving God and Mammon: 2. (vv. 25–34) with regard to earthly <i>cares</i>, from the assurance that our Father careth for us.<h2><u><b>19, 20. rust</b>]</u></h2> The word is more general in meaning than mere <i>rust</i>: it includes the ‘<i>wear and tear</i>’ of time, which eats into and consumes the fairest possessions. The <b>laying up treasures in heaven</b> would accumulate the “<i>bags that wax not old, a treasure that faileth not,</i>” of Luke xii. 33, corresponding to the “<i>reward</i>” of ch. v. 12, and the “<i>shall reward thee</i>” of vv. 4, 6, 18. See 1 Tim. vi. 19: Tobit iv. 9.<h3><u><b>break through</b>]</u></h3> usually joined with “<i>a house,</i>” as in ch. xxiv. 43, where the word in the original is the same.<h2><u><b>21.</b>]</u></h2> The connexion with the foregoing is plain enough to any but the shallowest reader. ‘The heart is, where the treasure is.’ But it might be replied, ‘I will have a treasure on earth and a treasure in heaven also: a divided affection.’ This is dealt with, and its impracticability shewn by a parable from nature.<h2><u><b>22, 23. The light</b>]</u></h2> as lighting and guiding the body and its members: not as containing light in itself. Similarly the inner light, the conscience, lights the spirit and its faculties, but by light supernal to itself.<br><br><b>single</b>, i.e. <b>clear</b>, untroubled in vision, as the eye which presents a well-defined and single image to the brain.<br><br><b>evil</b>, i.e. <b>perverse</b>, as the eye which dims and distorts the visual images.<h3><u><b>full of light</b>, rather, <i>in full light</i>, as an object in the bright sunshine; <b>full of darkness</b>, rather, as an object in the deep shade. <b>If therefore &c.</b>]</u></h3> Render, as in margin, If then the LIGHT w<b>hich is in thee is darkness, how dark is the</b> DARKNESS! i.e. ‘if the <i>conscience</i>, the eye and <i>light </i>of the soul, be <i>darkened</i>, in how <i>much grosser</i> darkness will all the <i>passions and faculties</i> be, which are of themselves <i>naturally dark!</i>’ This interpretation is that of nearly all the ancient fathers and versions. Stier expands it well: “As the body, of itself a dark mass, has its light from the eye, so we have here compared to it the sensuous, bestial life of men, their appetites, desires, and aversions, which belong to the lower creature. This dark region—human nature under the gross dominion of the flesh—shall become spiritualized, enlightened, sanctified, by the spiritual light: but if <i>this light</i> be darkness, how great must then the darkness of the <i>sensuous life</i> be!” The A.

Mammon does not appear to have been the name of any Syrian deity, as some assert.<h2><u><b>25. Therefore</b>]</u></h2> A direct inference from the foregoing verse: the plainer, since the verb signifies ‘to be distracted,’ ‘to have the mind drawn two ways.’ The A. V., ‘<i>Take no thought,</i>’ does not express the sense, but gives rather an exaggeration of the command, and thus makes it unreal and nugatory. <b>Take not anxious thought</b>, is far better. In Luke xii. 29 we have “<i>live not in careful suspense</i>” (A.V. marg.).<h3><u><b>Is not the life</b>]</u></h3> The argument is, ‘Shall not He who gave us the greater, also give us the less?’<h2><u><b>26.</b>]</u></h2> The two examples, of the birds and the lilies, are not parallel in their application. The first is an argument from the less to the greater; that our heavenly Father, who feeds the birds, will much more feed us: the second, besides this application, which (ver. 30) it also contains, is a reproof of the vanity of anxiety about clothing, which, in all its pomp of gorgeous colours, is vouchsafed to the inferior creatures, but not attainable by, as being unworthy of, us. Notice, it is not said “<i>Sow not, reap not, gather not into barns;</i>”—the birds are not our example to follow in their habits, for God hath made us to differ from them—the doing all these things is part of our “how much better are ye,” and increases the force of the <i>à fortiori</i>; but it is said, “<i>be not anxious,</i>”—“<i>be not in suspense</i>” Luke xii, 24).<br><br><b>your</b> <i>Father</i>, not <i>their</i> Father:—thus by every accessory word does our Lord wonderfully assert the truths and proprieties of creation, in which <i>we</i>, his sons, are His central work, and the rest for <i>us</i>.<br><br><b>of the air</b>, and after- wards <b>of the field</b>, as Tholuck remarks, are not superfluous, but serve to set forth the wild and uncaring freedom of the birds and lants. I may add,—also to set forth their lower rank in the scale of creation, as <i>belonging to</i> the air and the field. Who could say of all mankind, “<i>the men of the world?</i>” Thus the <i>à fortiori</i> is more plainly brought out.<h2><u><b>27.</b>]</u></h2> These words do not relate to the <i>stature</i>, the adding a cubit to which (= a foot and a half) would be a very great addition, instead of a very small one, as is implied here, and expressed in Luke xii. 26, “<i>if then ye be not able to do that thing which <b>i</b><b>s</b></i><b> least</b>,”—but to the <i>time of life</i> of each hearer; as Theophylact on Luke xii. 26, “The measure of life is with God alone, and each man cannot set the measure of his own age.” So the best Commentators: and the <i>context </i>seems imperatively to require it; for the object of food and clothing is not to <i>enlarge the body</i>, but to prolong life. The application of measures of space to time is not uncommon. See Ps. xxxix. 5: Job ix. 25: 2 Tim. iv. 7. Mimnermus, a Greek poet, speaks of “<i>a cubit's length of time.</i>” See other examples in my Gr.

Dr. Thomson, “The Land and the Book,” p. 256, believes the Huleh lily to be meant : “ it is very large, and the three inner petals meet above, and form a gorgeous canopy, such as art never approached, and king never sat under, even in his utmost glory. And when I met this incomparable flower, in all its love- Tiness, among the oak woods around the northern base of Tabor, and on the hills of Nazareth, where our Lord spent His youth, I felt assured that it was this to which He referred.” Probably, however, the word here may be taken in a wider im- port, as signifying all wild flowers.<h2><u><b>29.</b>]</u></h2> We here have the declaration of the Creator Himself concerning the relative glory and beauty of all human pomp, com- ed with the meanest of His own works. 2 Chron. ix. 15—28. And the mean- ing hidden beneath the text should not escape the student. As the beauty of the flower is unfolded by the divine Creator Spirit from <i>within</i>, from the laws and capacities of its <i>own</i> individual life, so must all true adornment of man be un- folded <i>from within</i> by the same Almighty Spirit. See 1 Pet. iii. 3,4. As nothing from without can defile a man, (ch. xv. 11,) so neither can any thing from without adorn him. Our Lord introduces with <b>“I say unto you”</b> His revelations of omniscience : see ch. xviii. 10, 19.<h2><u><b>30. the grass</b>]</u></h2> The wild flowers which form part of the meadow-growth are counted as belonging to the grass, and are cut down with it. Cat grass, which soon withers from the heat, is still used in the East for firing. See “The Land and the Book,” p. 341. <h3><u><b>the oven</b>]</u></h3> “a covered earthen vessel, a pan, wider at the bottom than at the top, wherein bread was baked by putting hot embers round it, which produced a more equable heat than in the regular oven.” Wilkinson and Webeter’s note. <h2><u><b>32. for your heavenly Father knoweth</b>]</u></h2> This second “<b>for</b>” brings in an <i>additional</i> reason. <h2><u><b>33. seek ye first</b>]</u></h2> Not with any reference to seeking these things <i>after</i> our religious duties, e. g. beginning with prayer days of avarice and worldly anxiety, but <b>make your great Object, as we say, your first care.</b><h3><u><b>his righteousness</b>]</u></h3> Not here the <i>forensic righteousness of justification</i>, but the <i>spiritual purity</i> inculcated in this discourse. <b>His</b> <i>righteousness</i> answers to <i>His perfection</i>, spoken of in ch. v. 48, and is another reference to the being as our heavenly Father is. In the Christian life which has been since unfolded, the righteousness of justification is a <i>necessary condition</i> of likeness to God ; but it is not the righteousness <i>here</i> meant. <h3><u><b>shall be added unto you</b>]</u></h3> There is a traditional saying of our Lord, “<i>Ask ye for great things, and small things shall be added unto you: ask for heavenly things, and earthly things shall be added unto you</i>.”<h2><u><b>34</b>]</u></h2> literally, <b>for the morrow will care for it, viz. for itself</b>, the morrow mentioned above: i.e. <i>will bring care enough about its own matters</i>: implying,— after all your endeavour to avoid worldly cares, you will find quite enough and more of them when to-morrow comes, about<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yolhYkHGCJzVBrqrpW0KnWtjOJmKB2ES/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The connexion with the last chapter is <i>immediately</i>, the word evil, in which a glance is given by the Saviour at the misery and sinfulness of human life at its best ;—and now precepts follow, teaching us how we are to live in such a world, and among others sinful like ourselves :—<i>mediately</i>, and more generally it is, the continuing caution against hypocrisy, in our- selves and in others. <h2><u><b>1</b>]</u></h2> This does not prohibit <i>all</i> judgment (see ver. 20, and 1 Cor. v.12); but, as Augustine, en- joins us to interpret others charitably in all cases where doubt may exist as to the motives of their actions. <br><br><b>judge</b> has been taken for “ condemn” here; and this seems necessary, at least in so far that it should be taken as implying an <i>ill judgment</i>. For if the command were merely “not to form authoritative judgments of others,’ the second member, “<i>that ye be not judged,</i>” would not, in its right interpretation, as applying to <i>God’s</i> judgment of <i>us</i>, correspond. And the ‘<i>condemn not</i>,” which follows in Luke vi. 87, is perhaps to be taken rather as an additional explanation of <i>judge</i>, than as a climax after it. <h3><u><b>judged</b>]</u></h3> i.e. ‘<i>by God,</i>’ for so doing ;—a parallel expression to ch. v. 7; vi. 15; not ‘<i>by others.</i>’ The bare passive, without the agent expressed, is solemn and emphatic. See note on Luke vi. 88; xvi.9; and xii. 20. The sense then is, ‘that you have not to answer before God for your rash judgment and its consequences.’ The same remarks apply to ver. 2. <h2><u><b>3—5.</b>]</u></h2> Lightfoot produces instances of this proverbial saying among the Jews. With them, however, it seems only to be used of a person retaliating rebuke; whereas our rd gives us a further application of it, viz. to the incapability of one involved in personal iniquity to form a right judgment on others, and the clearness given to the spiritual vision by conflict with and victory over evil. ere is also no doubt here a lesson given us of the true relative magnitude which our own faults, and those of our brother, ought to hold in our estimation. What is a <i>mote</i> to one looking on another, is to that other himself a <i>beam</i>: just the reverse of the ordinary estimate. <h2><u><b>3.</b>]</u></h2> <b>beholdest</b>, from with- out, a voluntary act: <b>considerest</b> <b>not,</b> <b>apprehendest not,</b> from within, that which is already there, and ought to have excited attention before.

The close is remarkable. <i>Before, to behold</i> the mote was all—to stare at thy brother's faults, and as people do who stand and gaze at an object, attract others to gaze also:—but <i>now</i>, the object is a very different one—to <i>cast out</i> the mote—to help thy brother to be rid of his fault, by doing him the best and most<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dp9vCC395x3dNgF26fFjrj84z3eXs3lY/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The <i>beholding</i> was vain and idle; the <i>seeing</i> <i>clearly</i> is for a blessed end, viz. (ch. xviii. 15) <i>to gain thy brother</i>. <h2><u><b>6.</b>]</u></h2> The connexion, see below. <h3><u><b>that which is holy</b>]</u></h3> Some have thought this, in the Greek, to a mistranslation of a Chaldee word signifying an earring, or amulet; but the connexion is not at all improved by it. Pearls bear a resemblance to peas or acorns, the food of swine, but earrings none whatever to the food of dogs. The similitude is derived from “<i>the holy things,</i>” <i>the meat offered tn sacrifice</i>, of which no unclean person was to eat (Lev. xxii. 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16). Similarly in the ancient Christian Liturgies and Fathers, “<i>the holy things</i>” are the consecrated elements in the Holy Communion. Thus interpreted, the saying would be one full of meaning to the <b>Jews</b>. As Dean Trench observes (Serm. Mount, p. 186), “It is not that the dogs would not eat it, for it would be welcome to them; but that it would be a profanation to give it to them, Exod. xxii. 31.” The other part of the similitude is of a different character, and belongs entirely to the swine, who having cast to them pearls, something like their natural food, whose valué is inappreciable by them, in fury trample them with their and turning against the donor, rend him with their tusks. The connexion with the foregoing and following verses is this: “<i>Judge not,” &c. ; “attempt not the correction of others, when you need it far more yourselves :</i>” still, “<i>be not such mere children, as not to distinguish the characters of those with whom you have to do. Give not that which is holy to dogs,</i>” &c. Then, as a humble hearer might be disposed to reply, ‘<i>if this last be a measure of the divine dealings, what bounties can I expect at God’s hand ?</i>” (vor. 7), ‘<i>ask of God, and He will give to each of you: for this is His own will, that you shall obtain by asking</i> (ver. 8),—<i>good things, good for each in his place and degree</i> (vv. 10, 11), <i>not unwholesome or unfitting things</i>. Therefore (ver. 12) <i>do ye the same to others, as ye wish to be done, and as God does, to you: viz. give that which is good for each, to each, not Judging uncharitably on the one hand, nor casting pearls before swine on the other</i>.’<h2><u><b>7</b>.]</u></h2> The three similitudes are all to be understood of <i>prayer</i>, and form a climax. <h2><u><b>8</b>.]</u></h2> The only <i>limitation</i> to this promise, which, under various forms, is several times repeated by our Lord, is furnished in vv. 9—11, and in James iv. 8, “Ye ask and receive not, because ye ask <i>amiss</i>.” <b>9</b>.] There are two questions here, the first of which is broken off. See a similar construction in ch. xii. 11. The similitude of bread (a loaf) and a stone also appears in ch. iv. 8. Luke (xi. 12) adds the and the scorpion. <h2><u><b>11. evil</b>]</u></h2> i.e. in comparison with God. It is not necessary to suppose a rebuke conveyed here, but only a general declaration of the corruption and infirmity of man. Augustine remarks, in accordance with this view, that the persons now addressed are the same who had been taught to say ‘ <i>Our Father</i>’ just now. Stier remarks, “This saying seems to me the strongest proof of original sin in the whole of the holy scriptures.” Reden Jesu, i. 236. <h3><u><b>good things</b>]</u></h3> principally, <i>His Holy Spirit</i>, Luke xi. 18. The same argument <i>a fortiori</i> is used by our Lord in the parable of the unjust judge, Luke xviii. 6, 7. <h2><u><b>12</b>.]</u></h2> Trench (Serm. on the Mount, p. 148) has noticed Augustine’s refutation of the sneer of infidels (such as Gibbon’s against this precept), that some of our Lord’s sayings have been before written by heathen authors.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dc_M-qyzcwrbrySewqKqxJAYhMYIuJNn/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This is not merely an arbitrary assignment of the <i>because</i>, but there is a deep meaning in it. The reason why so many perish is not that it is eo ordained by God, who will have all to come to the knowledge of the truth, but because so few will come to Christ, that they may have life ; and the rest perish in their sins.

Here it is evidently used of mere lip homage ; but in “<i>no man can </i><b>say</b><i> that Jesus is the Lord</i>,” 1 Cor. xii. 3, the “<i>saying</i>” has the deeper mean- ing of a genuine heartfelt confession. To seek for discrepancies in passages of this kind implies a predisposition to find them: and is to treat Holy Scripture with less than that measure of candour which we ive to the writings of one another.<h2><u><b>22. in that day</b>]</u></h2> perhaps refers to ver. 19: or it may be the expression 20 common in the prophets of <i>the great day of the Lord</i> : . Isa. ii. 20; xxv. 9 al. fr. Sothe Jews called the tt day of judgment “that day.” <h3><u><b>in thy name</b>]</u></h3> perhaps better <b>by thy name</b>, that name having filled out our belief, and been the object of our confession of faith. <h3><u><b>prophesied</b>]</u></h3> i.e., a so often in N.

He founds his house on a rock, who, hearing the words of Christ, brings his heart and life into accordance with His expressed will, and is thus by faith in union with Him, founded on Him. he who merely hears His words, but does them not, has never dug down to the rock, nor become united with it, nor has any stability in the hour of trial. <br><br>In the <i>rock</i>,—the <i>sand</i>,— the articles are categorical, importing that these two were usually found in the country where the discourse was delivered ;—in the <i>rain</i>, the <i>floods</i>, the <i>winds</i>, the same, implying that such trials of the stability of a house were common. In the whole of the similitude, reference is probably made to the Prophetic passage xxviii. 15—18. <h2><u><b>27. great</b>]</u></h2> All the greater, because such an one as here supposed is a <i>professed disciple—hearing these sayings</i>—and therefore would have the er to fall in case of apostasy.<h2><u><b>29</b>.]</u></h2> Chrysostom’s comment is, “For He did not say what He said on the authority of others, quoting Moses or the prophets, but every where alleging Himself to be the One who had the power. For when giving the law, he ever added, ‘ <i>But I say to you</i>,’ shewing that He him- self was the Judge.”<h1><u><b>CHAP. VIII. 1—4</b>.]</u></h1> HEALING OF A LEPER. Mark i.40—46. Luke v.12—14. We have now (in this and the following chapter), as it were, a <i>solemn procession of miracles</i>, confirming the authority wi which our Lord had spoken. <h2><u><b>2</b>.]</u></h2> This same miracle is related by St. Luke with- out any mark of definiteness, either as to time or place,— “ <i>And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city</i> .-..” In this instance there is, and can be, no doubt that the transactions are identical: and this may serve us as a key-note, by which the less obvious and more intricate harmonies of these two narrations may be ar- ranged. The plain assertion of the account in the text requires that the leper should have met our Lord on His descent from the mountain, while great multitudes were following Him. The accounts in St. Luke and St. Mark require no such fixed date. This narrative therefore fixes the occurrence. I conceive it highly probable that St. Matthew was himself a hearer of the Sermon, and one of those who followed our Lord at this time. From St. Luke’s account, the miracle was performed in, or rather, perhaps, in the neighbourhood of, some city: what city, does not appear. As the leper is in all three accounts related to have <i>come</i> to Jesus (“<i>And behold</i>” implying it in Luke), he may have been outside the city, and have run into it to our Lord. <h3><u><b>a leper</b>]</u></h3> The limits of a note allow of only an abridgment of the most important particulars relating to this dis- ease. Read Leviticus xiii. xiv. for the Mosaic enactments respecting it, and its nature and symptoms. See also Exod. iv. 6: Num. xii. 10: 2 Kings v. 27; xv. 5: 2 Chron. xxvi. 19, 21.

The fact of its non-contagious nature has been abundantly proved by learned men, and is evident from the Scripture itself: for the priests had continually to be in close contact with lepers, even to handling and examining them. We find Naaman, a leper, commanding the armies of Syria (2 Kings v. 1); Gehazi, though a leper, is conversed with by the king of Terael (2 Kings viii. 4, 5); and in the examination of a leper by the priest, if a man was <i>entirely</i> covered with leprosy, he was to be pronounced clean (Levit. xiii. 12, 18). The leper was not shut out from the synagogue, nor from the Christian churches. Besides, the analogy of the other uncleannesses under the Mosaic law, e.g. having touched the dead, having an issue, which are joined with leprosy (Num. v. 2), shews that sanitary caution was not the motive of these ceremonial enactments, but a far deeper reason. This disease was specially selected, as being the most loath- some and incurable of all, to represent the effect of the defilement of sin upon the once pure and holy body of man. “Leprosy was, indeed, nothing short of a living death, a poisoning of the springs, a corrupting of the humours, of life ; a dissolution, little by little, of the whole body, so that one limb after another actually decayed and fell away.” (Trench on the Miracles, p. 218.) See Num. xii. 12. The leper was the type of one dead in sin: the same emblems are used in his misery as those of mourning for the dead : the same means of cleansing as for uncleanness through connexion with death, and which were never used except on these two occasions. Compare Num. xix. 6, 13, 18, with Levit. xiv. 4—7. All this exclusion and mournful separation imported the Perpetual exclusion of the abominable and polluted from the true city of God, as declared Rev. xxi. 27. And David, when after his deadly sin he utters his prayer of penitence, ‘ Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean,’ Ps. li. 7, doubtless saw in his own utter spiritual uncleanness, that of which the ceremonial uncleanness that was purged with hyssop was the type. Thus in the above-cited instances we find leprosy inflicted as the punishment a rebellion, lying, and presumption. ‘I put the plague of | in an house’ (Levit. xiv. 34), ‘ Remember what the Lord thy God did to Miriam’ (Deut. xxiv. 9), and other passages, point out this plague as a peculiar infliction from God. “The Jews termed it ‘the finger of God,’ and emphatically ‘The’ stroke.’ They said that it attacked first a man’s house; and if he did not turn, his clothing; and then, if he persisted in sin, himself. So too, they said, that a man’s true repentance was the one condition of his leprosy leaving him.” Trench, . 216. The Jews, from the prophecy Isa. iii. 4, had a tradition that the Messiah should be a leper. <h3><u><b>worshipped him</b> ]</u></h3> “<i>falling on his face</i>,” Luke v.12; ‘‘<i>kneeling to him</i>,” Mark i. 40. These differences of expression are important. See beginning of note on this verse. <h3><u><b>Lord</b>]</u></h3> Not here merely a title of respect, but an expression of faith in Jesus as the Messiah. “This is the <i>right</i> utterance of ‘ <i>Lord</i>,’ which will never be made in vain.” Stier. When Miriam was a leper, ‘‘ Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, Heal her now, O God, 1 beseech thee,” Num. xii. 18.<h2><u><b>3. touched him</b>]</u></h2> He who just now expansively fulfilled the law by <i>word and commands</i>, now does the same by <i>act and deed</i>: the law had forbidden the touching of the leper, Levit. v. 3. It was an act which stood on the same ground as the healing on the Sabbath, of which we have so many instances. So likewise the prophets Elijah and Elisha touched the dead in the working of a miracle on them (1 Kings xvii. 21: 2 Kings iv. 34). The same almighty power which suspends natural laws, supersedes ceremonial laws.<br><br>Here is a noble example illustrating His own precept so lately delivered, ‘Give to him that asketh thee.’ Again, we can hardly forbear to recognize, in His touching the leper, a deed symbolic of His taking on him, touching, laying bold of, our nature. The same remarkable word is used in the Greek in Luke xiv. 4, “and <b>taking hold</b> of him, he healed him,” and in Heb. ii. 16, “He <b>taketh</b> not <b>hold of angels</b>, but he <b>taketh hold</b> of the seed of Abraham.”<h2><u><b>4. See thon tell no man</b>]</u></h2> Either (1) these words were a moral admonition, having respect to the state of the man (teaching him not to boast and seek admiration,” <b>as</b> Chrysostom), for the injunction to silence was not our Lord’s uniform practice (See Mark v. 19, || L.), and in this case they were of lasting obligation, that the cleansed leper <b>was</b> not .<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pghjdhCMZrt_y6rXwsxGpmy6-q-LNjDz/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Thus Apostles always refer primarily to the Resurrection, and only incidentally, if at all, to the wonders and signs. ‘Acts ii, 22—24; iii. 18—16.) These latter were tokens of power common to our Lord and his followers; but in His great conflict, ending in in His victory, He trod the winepress alone<h3><u><b>shew thyself to the priest</b>]</u></h3> Read Levit, xiv. 182. This command has been used in support of the theory of satisfaction by priestly confession and penance. But even then (Trench on the Miracles, p. 221, where see instances cited) the advocates of it are constrained to acknowledge that Christ alone is the cleanser. It is satisfactory to observe this drawing of parallels between “the Levitical and (popularly so called) Christian priesthood, thus completely shewing the fallacy and untenableness of the whole system ; all those priests being types, not of future human priests, but of Him, who abideth a Priest for ever in an unchangeable priesthood and in Whom not a class of Christians, but <i>all</i> Christians, are in the true sense priests unto God.<h3><u><b>a testimony unto them</b>]</u></h3> <b>A testimony</b> both <i>to</i>, and <i>against</i> <b>them</b>.

Luke vii. 1—10, where we have a more detailed account of the former part of this miracle. On the chronological ar- rangement, see Introduction. The centurion did not himself <i>come</i> to our Lord, but sent elders of the Jews to Him, who recommended him to His notice as loving their nation, and having built them a synagogue. Such variations, the concise account making a man do <i>by himself</i> what the fuller one relates that he <i>did by another</i>, are common in all written and oral narrations. In such cases the fuller account is, of course, the stricter one. Augustine, answering Faustas the Manichean, who wished, on account of the words of our Lord in ver. 11, to set aside the whole, and used this variation for that makes the remark, so important in these days, “Does not our human custom fur- nish abundance of such instances? Shall we read, and forget how we speak? Could we that Scripture would speak with us otherwise than in our own manner?” On the non-identity of this miracle with that in John iv. 46 ff, see note there.<h2><u><b>5. centurion</b>]</u></h2> he was a <i>Gentile</i>, see ver. 10, but one who was deeply attached to the Jews and their religions possibly, though this is uncertain, a of the gate he such term as “<i>devout</i>,” “<i>fearing God</i>,” is used of him, as commonly of these proselytes; Acts, x. 2 al.).<h2><u><b>6</b>.]</u></h2> From Luke we learn that it was “a slave, who was precious to him.” The centurion, perhaps, had <i>but one</i> slave, see ver. 9. <h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> The centurion heard that the Lord was coming, Luke vii. 6, and sent friends to Him with this second and still humbler message. He knew and felt himself, as a heathen, to be ont of the fold of God, a stranger to the commonwealth of Israel; and there- fore unworthy to receive under his roof the Redeemer of Israel. <h2><u><b>9</b>.]</u></h2> The meaning is, ‘I know how to obey, being<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RBdndSEnwcA8VGYof_p_Vj9cD5_XrjdU/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

These verses are wanting in St. Luke, and occur when our Lord repeated them on a wholly different occasion, ch. xiii. 28, 29. Compare a remarkable contrast in the Rabbinical books illustrating Jewish pride: “God said to the Israelites, In the world to come I will spread for you avast table, which the Gentiles shall see and be confounded.”<h2><u><b>13. was healed</b>]</u></h2> Of what precise disease does not appear. In Luke he was “<i>ready to die</i>”—here he is “<i>sick of the palsy, grievously tormented</i>.” But though these descriptions do not agree with ‘the<br><br>character of palsy among us, we read of a similar case in 1 Macc. ix. 55, 56: “At that time was Alcimus plagued and his enterprises hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no more speak any thing, nor order any thing concerning his house. So Alcimus died at that time with great torment.” The disease in the text may have been an attack of tetanus, which the ancient physicians included under lysis, and which is more common in jot countries than with us. It could hardly have been apoplexy, which usually bereaves of sensation.<h2><u><b>14—17.</b>]</u></h2> HEALING OF PETER’S WIFE’S MOTHER, AND MANY OTHERS. Mark i. 29—34. Luke iv. 38—41. From the other Evangelists it appears, that our Lord had just healed a demoniac in the synagogue at Capernaum : for they both state, ‘when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew,’ &c. Both Mark and Luke are fuller in their accounts than the text. The expression (of the fever) it <b>left her</b>, is common to the three, as is also the circum- stance of her ministering <i>immediately</i> after: shewing that the fever left her, not, as it would have done if natural means had been used, weak and exhausted, but completely restored. <h2><u><b>16</b>.]</u></h2> <i>at sunset</i>, Mark ver. 82: Luke ver. 40.

They brought sick in the evening, either because it was cool,—or because the day’s work was over, and men could be found to carry them,—or perhaps because it was the sab- bath (see Mark i. 21, 29, 82), which ended at sunset. <h2><u><b>17</b>.]</u></h2> The exact sense in which these words are quoted is matter of difficulty. Some understand <b>took</b> and <b>bare</b> as merely ‘took away,’ and ‘healed.’ But besides this being a very harsh interpretation of both words, it entirely destroys the force of <b>Himself</b>, and makes it expletive. Others suppose it to refer to the personal fatigue, (or even the spiritual ex- haustion, [Olshausen,] which perhaps is hardly consistent with sound doctrine,) which our Lord felt by these cures being; long protracted into the evening. But believe the true relevancy of the prophecy is to be sought by regarding the miracles generally to have been, as we know so many of them were, lesser and typical outshewings of the great work of bearing the sin of the world, which He came to accomplish ; just as diseases themselves, on which those miracles , are all so many testimonies to existence, and types of the effect, of sin. Moreover in these His deeds of mercy, He was ‘touched with the feeling of our infirmities :’ witness His tears at the grave of and His sighing over the deaf and dumb man, Mark vii. 84. The very act of compassion is (as the name imports) a <i>suffering with</i> its object; and if this be true between man and man, how much more strictly so in His case who had taken upon Him the whole burden of the sin of the world, with all its sad train of sorrow and suffering.<h2><u><b>18—1X. 1.</b>]</u></h2> JESUS CROSSES THE LAKE. INCIDENTS BEFORE EMBARKING. HE STILLS THE STORM. HEALING OF TWO DAEMONIACS IN THE LAND OF THE GADARENES. Mark iv. 35—v. 20: Luke ix. 67—60; viii. 22—39, on which passages compare the notes. 18.) It is obviously the intention of St. Matthew to bind on the following incidents to the occurrence which he had just related.<h2><u><b>19</b>.]</u></h2> Both, the following incidents are laced by St. Luke long after, during our Lord’s last journey to Jerusalem. For it is quite impossible (with Greswell, Diss. iii. p. 155 sq.) in any common fairness of interpretation, to imagine that two such incidents should have twice happened, and both times have been related together. It is one of those cases where the attempts of the Harmonists do violence to every principle of sound historical criticism. Every such difficulty, instead of being a thing to be wiped out and buried up at all hazards (I am sorry to see, e. g., that Dr. Wordsw. takes no notice, either here or in St. Luke, of the recurrence of the two narratives), is a valuable index and guide to the humble searcher after truth, and is used by him as such (see Introduction).<h2><u><b>20. the Son of man</b>]</u></h2> “It is thought that this phrase was taken from Daniel vii. 13, to which passage our Saviour seems to allude in ch. xxvi. 64, and probably Stephen in Acts vii. 56. It appears from John xii. 34, that the Jews understood it to mean the Messiah: and from Luke xxii. 69, 70, that they considered the <i>Son of Man</i> to mean the same as <i>the</i> <i>Son of God</i>.” Dr. Burton. It is the name by which the Lord ordinarily in one pregnant word designates Himself as the Messiah—the <i>Son of God manifested in the flesh of man</i>—the <i>second</i> <i>Adam</i>.

Clement of Alexandria this as having been said <i>to Philip</i>. But if so, He had long ago ordered Philip to follow Him, taking St. Luke’s order of the occurrence. A tradition of this nature was hardly likely to be wrong; so that perhaps the words <b>Follow me</b> are to be taken (as in John xxi. 19, 22) as an admonition occasioned by some slackness or symptom of decadence on the part of the Apostle. The attempt to evade the strong words of our Lord’s command by supposing that to bury my father means, ‘ <i>to reside with my father is death</i>’ (Theophylact), is evidently futile, since “<i>first to go and bury</i>” is plainly said of an <i>act waiting to be done</i>; and the reason of our Lord’s rebuke was the peremptory and all-superseding nature of the command “ <i>Follow me</i>.” <h2><u><b>22. the dead</b>]</u></h2> <i>First</i> time, as Rev. iii. 1, <i>spiritually</i>,—second, <i>literally</i> dead.

By Mark with a precise Dote of sequence: “<i>the same day, when the even was come</i>, he saith unto them,” Mark iv. 35. <h2><u><b>24. being covered</b>]</u></h2> compare Mark iv.87: Luke viii. 28. By keeping to the strict imperfect sense, we obviate all necessity for qualifying these words: the ship was becoming covered, &c. All lakes bordered by mountains, and indeed all hilly coasts, are liable to these sudden gusts of wind. <h2><u><b>25</b>.]</u></h2> <b>Lord, save us: we perish =</b> <i>Master, carest thou not that we perish</i>, Mark iv. 38 = <i>Master, Master, we perish</i>, Luke viii. 24. On these and such like variations, notice the following excellent and important remarks of Augustine: “The sense of the disciples waking the Lord and seeking to be saved, is one and the same: nor is it worth while to enquire which of these three was really said to Christ. For whether they said any one of these three, or other words which no one of the Evangelists has mentioned, but of similar import as to the truth of the sense, what matters it?” We may wish that he had alway spoken thus. Mach useless labour might have been and men’s minds led to the diligent enquiry into the real difficulties of the Gospels, instead of so many spending time in knitting cobwebs. But Augustine himself in the very next sentence descends to the unsatisfactory ground of the Harmonists, <i>when he adds. “ Though it may be also, that when many were calling upon Him, all these may have been said, one by one, another by another</i>.” His mind however was not one to rest contented with such sophisms; and all his deeper und more earnest sayings are in the truer and freer spirit of the above extract. The above remarks are more than ever important, now that a reaction towards the low literal harmonistic view has set in, and the inspiration of the mere letter is set up against those who seek for life in searching the real spirit of the Scriptures.<h2><u><b>28</b>.]</u></h2> The time of this rebuke in the text precedes, but in Mark and Luke follows, the stilling of the storm.

The Saviour with the company of His disciples in the ship tossed on the waves, seemed a typical reproduction of the Ark bearing mankind on the flood, and a foreshadowing of the Church tossed by the tempests of this world, but having Him with her always. And the personal application is one of comfort, and strengthening of faith, in danger and doubt.<h2><u><b>27. the men]</u></h2></b> The men who were in the ship, besides our Lord and His disciples. <h2><u><b>28.]</u></h2></b> Among the difficulties attendant on this narrative, the situation and name of the place where the event happened are not the least. Origen discusses the three, <i>Gerasa</i>, which he found in the text in his time, but pronounces to be a city of Arabia, having no sea or lake near it,—<i>Gadara</i>, which he found in a few MSS., but disapproves, as a city of Judæa, not near any lake or sea with cliffs;—and <i>Gergesa</i>, which he says is a city on the lake of Tiberias, with a cliff hanging over the lake, where the spot of the miracle was shewn. Notwithstanding this, it appears very doubtful whether there ever was a town named Gergesha (or -sa) near the lake. There were the Gergashites (Joseph. i. 6. 2) in former days, but their towns had been destroyed by the Israelites at their first irruption, and never, that we hear of, afterwards rebuilt (see Deut. vii. 1: Josh. xxiv. 11). Gerasa (now Dscherasch) lies much too far to the East. The town of Gadara, alluded to in the text, was a strong chief city in Peræa, opposite Scythopolis and Tiberias to the East, in the mountain, at whose foot were the well-known warm baths. It was on the river Hieromax, and sixty stadia from Tiberias, a Greek city (see raff. to Josephus and Eusebius in my Gr. Test.). It was destroyed in the civil wars of the Jews, and rebuilt by Pompeius, presented by Augustus to King Herod, and after his death united to the province of Syria. It was one of the ten cities of Decapolis. Burckhardt and others believe that they have found its ruins at Omkeis, near the ridge of the chain which divides the valley of Jordan from that of the sea of Tiberias. The territory of this city might well extend to the shore of the lake. It may be observed, that there is nothing in any of the three accounts to imply that the city was close to the scene of the miracle, or the scene of the miracle close to the herd of swine, or the herd of swine, at the time of their possession, close to the lake. Indeed the expression “<i>a good way off from them,</i>” ver. 30, implies the contrary with regard to the swine. It appears, from Burckhardt, that there are many tombs in the neighbourhood of the ruins of Gadara to this day, hewn in the rock, and thus capable of affording shelter. It may be well in fairness to observe, that “<i>Gergesenes</i>” can hardly have arisen, as sometimes represented, entirely from Origen’s conjecture, as it pervades so many MSS. and ancient (it is true, not the <i>most</i> ancient) versions. We cannot say that a part of the territory of Gadara may not have been known to those who, like Matthew, were locally intimate with the shores of the lake, by this ancient and generally disused name. Still however, we are, I conceive, bound in a matter of this kind to follow the most ancient extant testimony. See further on the parallel places in Mark and Luke.<h3><u><b>two possessed with devils]</u></h3></b> In Mark v. 2, and Luke viii. 27, but <i>one</i> is mentioned. All three Evangelists have some particulars peculiar to themselves; but Mark the most, and the most striking, as having evidently proceeded from an eye-witness. The “<i>we are many</i>” of Mark is worth noticing, in reference to the discrepancy of number in the two accounts, as perhaps connected with the mention of more than one by our Evangelist, who omits the circumstance connected with that speech.<h3><u><b>exceeding fierce]</u></h3></b> See the terribly graphic account of St. Mark (v. 3–6). The dæmoniac was without clothes, which though related only by St. Luke (viii. 27), yet, with remarkable consistency, appears from St. Mark’s narrative, where he is described as<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dRdu242rsfKO6CbmlSORnOypHZaAo-O4/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

These, especially the first, would seem to imply that the swine were on the hills, and the scene of the miracle at some little distance, on the plain.<h2><u><b>31.</b>]</u></h2> St. Mark and St. Luke give, as the ground of this request, that they might not be <i>sent out of the land</i> = <i>into the abyss</i>, i.e. out of their permitted residence on earth to torment before the time in the abyss. See note on Luke.<h2><u><b>32.</b>]</u></h2> This remarkable narrative brings before us the whole question of DÆMONIACAL POSSESSIONS in the Gospels, which I shall treat here once for all, and refer to this note hereafter.<br><br>I would then remark in general, (I. 1) that the Gospel narratives are <i>distinctly pledged to the historic truth of these occurrences</i>. Either they are true, or the Gospels are false. For they do not stand in the same, or a similar position, with the discrepancies in detail, so frequent between the Evangelists: but they form part of that general groundwork in which all agree. (2) Nor can it be said that they represent the <i>opinion of the time</i>, and use words in accordance with it. This might have been difficult to answer, but that they not only give such expressions as <i>possessed with devils, demonized</i> (Mark v. 16: Luke viii. 36), and other like ones, but relate to us words <i>spoken by the Lord Jesus</i>, in which <i>the personality and presence of the demons is distinctly implied</i>. See especially Luke xi. 17–26. Now either our Lord spoke these words, or He did not. If He did not, then we must at once set aside the concurrent testimony of the Evangelists to a plain matter of fact ; in other words establish a principle which will overthrow equally every fact related in the Gospels. If He did, it is wholly at variance with any Christian idea of the perfection of truthfulness in Him who was Truth itself, to suppose Him to have used such plain and solemn words repeatedly, before His disciples and the Jews, in encouragement of, and connivance at, a lying supersti- tion. (8) After these remarks, it will be unnecessary to refute that view of dæmoniacal possession which makes it <i>identical with mere bodily disease</i>,—as it is included above; but we may observe, that it is every where in the Is distinguished from disease, and in such a way as to shew that, at all events, the two were not in that day confounded. (See ch, ix. 32, 33, and compare Mark vii. 32.) (4) The question then arises, <i>Granted the plain historical truth of demoniacal pos- session</i>, WHAT WAS IT? This question, in the suspension, or withdrawal, of the gift of ‘discerning of spirits’ in the modern Church, is not easy to answer. But we may gather from the Gospel narratives some important ingredients for our description. The dæmoniac was one whose being was strangely interpenetrated (‘<i>possessed</i>’ is the most exact word that could be found) by one or more of those fallen spirits, who are constantly asserted in Scripture (under the name of <i>dæmons, evil spirits, unclean spirits</i>, their chief being <i>the devil</i> or <i>Satan</i>) to be the enemies and tempters of the souls of men. (See Acts v. 3: John xiii. 2, and passim.) He stood in a totally different position from the abandoned wicked man, who morally is given over to the devil. This latter would be a subject for punishment; but the dæmoniac for deepest compassion. There appears to have been in him a <i>double will </i>and <i>double consciousness</i>—sometimes the cruel spirit thinking and speaking in him, sometimes his poor crushed self crying out to the Saviour of men for mercy: a terrible advantage taken, and a personal realization, by the malignant powers of evil, of the struggle between sense and conscience in the man of morally divided life. Hence it has been not<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lbBUTuE7A7i3RunWNVDp0DD820VxeqL6/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

(5) The frequently urged objection, How comes it that this malady is not <i>now</i> among us? admits of an easy answer, even if the assumption be granted. The period of our Lord’s being on earth was certainly more than any other in the history of the world under the dominion of evil. The foundations of man’s moral being were broken up, and the ‘hour and power of darkness’ prevailing. Trench excellently remarks, ‘It was exactly the crisis for such soul-maladies as these, in which the spiritual and bodily should be thus strangely interlinked, and it is nothing wonderful that they should have abounded at that time; for the predominance of certain spiritual maladies at certain epochs of the world’s history which were specially fitted for their generation, with their gradual decline and disappearance in others less congenial to them, is a fact itself admitting no manner of question’ (pp. 162, 163). Besides, as the same writer goes on to observe, there can be no doubt that the coming of the Son of God in the flesh, and the continual testimony of Jeeus borne by the Church in her preaching and ordinances, have broken and kept down, in some measure, the grosser manifestations of the power of Satan. (See Luke x. 18.) But (6) the assumption contained in the objection above must not be thus unreservedly granted. We cannot tell in how many cases of insanity the malady may not even now be traced to direct dæmoniacal possession. And, finally, (7) the above view, which I am persuaded is the only one honestly consistent with any kind of belief in the truth of the Gospel narratives, will offend none but those who deny the existence of the world of spirits altogether, and who are continually striving to narrow the limits of our belief in that which is invisible; a view which at every step involves difficulties far more serious than those from which it attempts to escape. But (II.) a fresh difficulty is here found in the latter part of the narrative, in which the devils <i>enter into the swine</i>, and <i>their destruction follows</i>. (1) Of the <i>reason</i> of this permission, we surely are not competent judges. Of this however we are sure, that ‘if this granting of the request of the evil spirits helped in any way the cure of the man, caused them to resign their hold on him more easily, mitigated the paroxysm of their going forth (see Mark ix. 26), this would have been motive enough. Or still more probably, it may have been necessary, for the permanent healing of the man, that he should have an outward evidence and testimony that the hellish powers which held him in bondage had quitted him.’ (Trench, p. 172.) (2) The destruction of the swine is not for a moment to be thought of in the matter, as if that were an act repugnant to the merciful character of our Lord’s miracles. It finds its parallel in the cursing of the fig-tree (ch. xxi. 18–22); and we may well think that, if God has appointed so many animals daily to be slaughtered for the sustenance of men’s bodies, He may also be pleased to destroy animal life when He sees fit for the liberation or instruction of their souls. Besides, if the confessedly far greater evil of the possession of <i>men </i>by evil spirits, and all the misery thereupon attendant, was permitted in God’s inscrutable purposes, surely much more this lesser one. Whether there may have been special reasons in this case, such as the contempt of the Mosaic law by the keepers of the swine, we have no means of judging: but it is at least possible. (3) The fact itself related raises a question in our minds, which, though we cannot wholly answer, we may yet approximate to the solution of. How can we imagine the bestial nature capable of the reception of dæmoniac influence? If what has been cited above be true, and the unchecked indulgence of sensual appetite afforded an inlet for the powers of evil to possess the human demoniac, then we have their influence joined to that part of man’s nature which he has in common with the brutes that perish, the <i>animal and sensual soul</i>.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FAtk1MzZ9zUweNiIauM2D5KI_pz6-nWd/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But with this weighty difference : that whereas in man there is an individual, immortal spirit, to which alone belongs his personality and deliberative will and reason, and there was ever in him, as we have seen, a struggle and a protest against this tyrant power; the oppressed soul, the real ‘I,’ calling out against the usurper— this would not be the case with the brute, in whom this personality and reflective consciousness is wanting. And the result in the text confirms our view; for as soon as the demons enter into the swine, their ferocity, having no self-conserving balance as in the case of man, impels them headlong to their own destruction.<h2><u><b>34.</b>]</u></h2> This request, which is related by all three Evangelists, was probably not from humility, but for fear the miraculous powers of our Lord should work them still more worldly loss. For the additional particulars of this miracle, see Mark v. 15, 16, 18–20: Luke vii. 35, and notes.<h2><u><b>IX. 1.</b>]</u></h2> Certainly this verse should be the sequel of the history in the last chapter. It is not connected with the miracle following;— which is placed by St. Luke at a different time, but with the indefinite introduction of “<i>it came to pass on a certain day.</i>”<h3><u><b>his own city</b>]</u></h3> Capernaum, where our Lord now dwelt: cf. ch. iv. 13.<h2><u><b>2—8.</b>]</u></h2> HEALING OF A PARALYTIC AT CAPERNAUM. Mark ii. 1–12: Luke v. 17 –26, in both of which the account is more particular.<h2><u><b>2. their faith</b>]</u></h2> Namely, in letting him down through the roof, because the whole house and space round the door was full, Mark ii. 4 their must be supposed to include the sick man, who was at least a consenting party to the bold step which they took. These words are common to the three Evangelists, as also “<i>thy sins be forgiven.</i>”<br><br>Neander has some excellent remarks on this man’s disease. Either it was the natural consequence of sinful indulgence, or by its means the feeling of sinfulness and guilt was more strongly aroused in him, and he recognized the misery of his disease as the punishment of his sins. At all events spiritual and bodily pain seem to have been connected and interchanged within him, and the former to have received accession of strength from the presence of the latter. Schleiermacher supposes the haste of these bearers to have originated in the prospect of our Lord’s speedy departure thence; but, as Neander observes, we do not know enough of the paralytic’s own state to be able to say whether there may not have been some cause for it in the man him- self.<h2><u><b>4. knowing</b>]</u></h2> lit., <b>seeing</b>: viz. by the spiritual power indwelling in Him: See John ii. 24, 25. No other interpretation of such passages is admissible. St. Mark’s expression, “<i>perceived in his spirit,</i>” is more precise and conclusive. From <b>wherefore </b>to <b>thine house</b> is common (nearly verbatim) to the three Evangelists.<h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2> “In our Lord’s argument it must be carefully noted, that He does not ask, <i>which is easiest</i>, to <i>forgive sins</i>, or to <i>raise a sick man</i>—for it could not be affirmed that that of forgiving was easier than this of healing—but, which is easiest, to <i>claim this power</i> or<i> that, to say</i>, Thy sins be forgiven thee, or <i>to say</i>, Arise and walk?

By these visible tides of God’s grace I will give you to know in what direction the great under-currents of His love are setting, and that both are obedient to My word. From this, which I will now do openly and before you all, you may conclude that it is ‘no robbery’: (Phil. ii. 6, but see note there) upon my part to claim also the power of forgiving men their sins.” Trench on the Miracles, p. 206.<h2><u><b>6. the Son of man</b>]</u></h2> The Messiah: an expression regarded by the Jews as equivalent to “<i>the Christ, the Son of God,”</i> ch. xxvi. 63. See also John v. 27. “The Alexandrian Fathers, in their conflict with the Nestorians, made use of this passage in proof of the entire transference which there was of all the properties of Christ’s divine nature to His human; so that whatever one had, was so far common, that it might also be predicated of the other. It is quite true that had not the two natures Been indissolubly knit together in a single Person, no such language could have been used; yet I should rather suppose that ‘Son of Man’ being the standing title whereby the Lord was well pleased to designate Himself, bringing out by it that He was at once one with humanity, and the crown of humanity, He does not so use it that the title is every where to be pressed, but at times simply as equivalent to Messiah.” Trench, p. 208.<h3><u><b>on earth</b>]</u></h3> Distinguished from “<i>in heaven,</i>” as in ch. xvi. 19; xviii. 18. Bengel finely remarks, “ This saying savours of heavenly origin.” The Son of Man, as God manifest in man’s flesh, has on man’s earth that power, which in its fountain and essence belongs to God in heaven. And this not by delegation, but “because He (being God) is the Son of Man.” John v. 27.<h3><u><b>then saith he</b>]</u></h3> See a similar interchange of the persons in construction, Gen. iii. 22, 23.<h2><u><b>8. unto men</b>]</u></h2> Not plur. for sing. ‘<i>to a man,</i>’ nor, ‘<i>for the benefit of men;</i>’ but <b>to mankind</b>. They regarded this wonder-working as something by God granted to men—to mankind; and without supposing that <i>they</i> had before them the full meaning of their words, those words were true in the very highest sense. See John xvii. 8. In Mark they say, “<i>We never saw it in this fashion:</i>” in Luke, “<i>We have seen strange things to-day.</i>”<h2><u><b>9—17.</b>]</u></h2> THE CALLING OF MATTHEW: THE FEAST CONSEQUENT ON IT: ENQUIRY OF JOHN’S DISCIPLES RESPECTING FASTING:—AND OUR LORD’S ANSWER. Mark ii. 13–22: Luke v. 27–39. Our Lord was going out to the sea to teach, Mark, ver. 13. All three Evangelists connect this calling with the preceding miracle, and the subsequent entertainment. The real difficulty of the narrative is the question as to the identity of Matthew in the text, and Levi in Mark and Luke. I shall state the arguments on both sides. (1) There can be no question that <i>the three narratives relate to the same event</i>. They are identical almost verbatim: inserted between narratives indisputably relating the same occurrences. (2) The almost <i>general consent</i> of all ages has supposed the <i>two persons the same</i>.<br><br>On the other hand, (3) <i>our Gospel makes not the slightest allusion to the name of Levi</i>, either here, or in ch. x. 3, where we find “<i>Matthew the publican</i>” among the Apostles, clearly identified with the subject of this narrative: whereas the <i>other two Evangelists</i>, having in this narrative spoken of Levi in their enumerations of the Apostles (Mark iii. 18; Luke vi. 15), <i>mention Matthew without any note of</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEofQh95rhm8PXvWT6EWR9KSi5eQaPn3/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 1, Page 127:</a></h3><br><i>identification with the Levi called on this occasion</i>. This is almost inexplicable, on the supposition of his having borne both names. (4) <i>Early tradition separates the two persons</i>. Clement of Alexandria, quoting from Heracleon the Gnostic, mentions Matthew, Philip, Thomas, Levi, and many others, as eminent men who had not suffered martyrdom from a public confession of the faith. (5) Again, Origen, when Celsus has called the Apostles publicans and sailors, after acknowledging Matthew the publican, adds, “And there may be also Levi a publican among Jesus’s followers. But he was not of the number of His Apostles, except according to some copies of Mark’s Gospel.” It is not quite clear from this, whether the copies of Mark substituted Levi’s(?) name for Matthew’s, or for some other: but most probably the latter. (6) It certainly would hence appear, as if there were in ancient times an idea that the two names belonged to distinct persons. But in the very passages where it is mentioned, a confusion is evident, which prevents us from drawing any certain conclusion able to withstand the general testimony to the contrary, arising from the prima facie view of the Gospel narrative. (7) It is probable enough that St. Matthew, in his own Gospel, would <i>mention only his apostolic name</i>, seeing that St. Mark and St. Luke also give him this name, <i>when they speak of him as an Apostle</i>. (8) It is remarkable, as an indication that St. Matthew's frequently unprecise manner of narration did not proceed from want of information,—that in this case, when he of all men must have been best informed, his own account is the least precise of the three. (9) With regard to the narrative itself in the text, we may observe, that this solemn and peculiar call seems (see ch. iv. 19, 22) <i>hardly to belong to any but an Apostle</i>; and that, as in the case of Peter, it here also <i>implies a previous acquaintance and discipleship</i>. (10) We are told in Luke v. 29, that Levi <i>made him a great feast in his house</i>; and, similarly, Mark has “<i>in his house.</i>” The<br><br>narrative in our text is so closely identical with that in Mark, that it is impossible to suppose, with Greswell, that a different feast is intended. The arguments by which he supports his view are by no means weighty. From the words <b>the house</b>, he infers that the house was not that of Matthew, but that in which our Lord usually dwelt, which he supposes to be intended in several other places. But surely the article might be used without any such significance, or designating any particular house,—as would be very likely if Matthew himself is here the narrator. Again, Greswell presses to verbal accuracy the terms used in the accounts, and attempts to shew them to be inconsistent with one another. But surely the time is past for such dealing with the historic text of the Gospels; and, besides, he has overlooked a great inconsistency in his own explanation, viz. that of making in the second instance, according to him, Scribes and Pharisees present at the feast given by a Publican, and exclaiming against that which they themselves were doing. It was not <i>at</i>, but <i>after </i>the feast that the discourse in vv. 11—17 took place. And his whole inference, that the <i>great feast</i> must be the great meal in the day, and consequently in the evening, hangs on too slender a thread to need refutation. The real difficulty, insuperable to a Harmonist, is the connexion here of the raising of Jaeirus’s daughter with this feast : on which see below, ver. 18.<h2><u><b>11.</b>]</u></h2> These Pharisees appear to have been the Pharisees <i>of the place</i>: Luke has “<i>their Scribes and Pharisees.</i>” The very circumstances related shew that this remonstrance cannot have taken place <i>at</i> the feast. The Pharisees say the words to the disciples : our Lord hears it. This denotes an occasion when our Lord and the disciples were present, but not surely intermixed with the <i>great company of publicans.</i><h2><u><b>12. whole . . . sick</b>]</u></h2> Both words, in the application of the saying, must be understood <i>subjectively </i>(an ironical concession, as Calvin, Meyer): as referring<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wnegno4_ErZTSo-C66X68OIcHNPw-US-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

St. Luke continues the discourse as that of the former Pharisees and Scribes. This is one of those instances where the three accounts imply and confirm one another, and the hints incidentally dropped by one Evangelist form the prominent assertions of the other.<br><br><i>The fasting often</i> of the disciples of John must not be understood as done in mourning for their master’s imprisonment, but as belonging to the asceticism which John, as a preacher of repentance, inculcated. On the fasts of the Pharisees, see Lightfoot in loc.<h2><u><b>15. mourn</b>]</u></h2> = “<i>fast,</i>” Mark and Luke. The difference of these two words is curiously enough one of Greswell’s arguments for the non-identity of the narratives. Even if there were any force in such an argument, we might fairly set against it that the Greek word rendered <b>taken</b> is common to all three Evangelists, and occurs no where else in the N. T.<h3><u><b>the bridegroom</b>]</u></h3> This appellation of Himself had from our Lord peculiar appropriateness as addressed to the disciples of John. Their master had himself used the figure, and the very word in John iii. 29. Our Lord, in calling Himself the Bridegroom, announces the fulfilment in Him of a whole cycle of O.T. prophecies and figures: very probably with <i>immediate </i>reference to Hosea ii., that prophet having been cited just before : but also to many other passages, in which the Bride is the Church of God, the Bridegroom the God of Israel. See especially Isa. liv. 5–10 Heb. and E.V. As Stier (i. 320, edn. 2) observes, the article <b>the</b> here must not be considered as merely introduced on account of the parable, as usual elsewhere, but the parable itself to have sprung out of the emphatic name, “<b>the bridegroom.</b>” The <b>sons of the bridechamber</b> are more than the mere guests at the wedding: they are the bridegroom’s friends who go and fetch the bride.<h3><u><b>the days will come</b>]</u></h3> How sublime and peaceful is this early announcement by our Lord of the bitter passage before Him! Compare the words of our Christian poet: ‘measuring with calm presage the infinite descent.’ It has been asked, “What man ever looked so calmly, so lovingly, from such an height down to such a depth!”<h3><u><b>shall be</b>]</u></h3> more properly, <b>shall have been taken from them</b>: when His departure shall have taken place.<h3><u><b>and then shall</b> (<i>better</i>, <b>will</b>) <b>they fast</b>]</u></h3> These words are not a declaration of a duty, or of an ordinance, as binding on the Church in the days of her Lord’s absence: the whole spirit of what follows is against such a supposition: but they declare, in accordance with the parallel word “<i>mourn,</i>” that in those days they shall have <i>real occasion</i> for fasting; sorrow enough; see John xvi. 20:–a fast of God’s own appointing in the solemn purpose of His will respecting them, not one of their own arbitrary laying on. This view is strikingly brought out in Luke, where the question is, “Can ye <i>make </i>the sons, &c. <i>fast</i>,” i.e. by your rites and ordinances? “but, &c.” and <i>then shall they fast</i>: there is no constraint in this latter case: they shall (will) fast. And this furnishes us with an analogous rule for the fasting of the Christian life: that it should be the genuine offspring of inward and spiritual sorrow, of the sense<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jk-wYJRCac37MbfpLARHaZuDo27Z1tyR/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is an instructive circumstance that in the Reformed Churches, while those stated fasts which were retained at their first emergence from Popery are in practice universally disregarded even by their best and holiest sons,—nothing can be more affecting and genuine than the universal and solemn observance of any real occasion of fasting placed before them by God’s Providence: It is also remarkable how uniformly a strict attention to artificial and prescribed fasts accompanies a hankering after the hybrid ceremonial system of Rome.<br><br>Meyer remarks well that <b>then</b> refers to a definite point of time, not to the whole subsequent period.<h2><u><b>16.</b>]</u></h2> Our Lord in these two parables contrasts the old and the new, the legal and evangelic dispensations, with regard to the point on which He was questioned. The idea of the <i>wedding </i>seems to run through them; the preparation of the robe, the pouring of the new wine, are connected by this as their leading idea to one another and to the preceding verses.<br><br>The old system of prescribed fasts for fasting’s sake must not be patched with the new and sound piece; the complete and beautiful whole of Gospel light and liberty must not be engrafted as a mere addition on the worn-out system of ceremonies. For the <i>filling it up</i>, the completeness of it, the new patch, by its weight and its strength pulls away the neighbouring weak and loose threads by which it holds to the old garment, and a worse rent is made. Stier notices the prophetic import of this parable: in how sad a degree the Lord’s saying has been fulfilled in the History of the Church, by the attempts to patch the new, the Evangelic state, upon the old worn-out ceremonial system. ‘Would,’ he adds, ‘that we could say in the interpretation, as in the parable, <i>No man doeth this!</i>’ The robe must be <i>all new</i>, all consistent: old things, old types, old ceremonies, old burdens, sacrifices, priests, sabbathe, and holy days, all are passed away: behold all things are become new.<h3><u><b>a worse rent is made</b>]</u></h3> a worse rent, because the old, original rent was included within the circumference of the <i>patch</i>, whereas this is outside it.<h2><u><b>17.</b>]</u></h2> This parable is not a repetition of the previous one, but a stronger and more exact setting forth of the truth in hand. As is frequently our Lord’s practice in His parables, He advances from the immediate subject to something more spiritual and higher, and takes occasion from answering a cavil, to preach the sublimest truths. The garment was something <i>outward</i>; this wine is <i>poured in</i>, is something <i>inward</i>, the spirit of the system. The former parable respected the outward freedom and simple truthfulness of the New Covenant; this regards its inner spirit, its pervading principle. And admirably does the parable describe the vanity of the attempt to keep the new wine in the <i>old skin</i>, the old ceremonial man, unrenewed in the spirit of his mind: <i>the skins are broken</i>: the new wine is something too living and strong for so weak a moral frame; it shatters the fair outside of ceremonial seeming; and <i>the wine runneth out</i>, the spirit is lost; the man is neither a blameless Jew nor a faithful Christian; both are spoiled. And then the result: not merely the damaging, but the utter destruction of the vessel,— <i>the skins perish</i>. According to some expositors, the <i>new patch</i> and <i>new wine</i> denote the <i>fasting</i>; the <i>old garment</i> and <i>old bottles</i>, the <i>disciples</i>.<br><br>This view is stated and defended at some length by Neander; but I own seems to me, as to De Wette, far-fetched. For how can fasting be called <i>a patch of new</i> (unfulled) <i>cloth</i>, or how compared to new wine? And Neander himself, when he comes to explain the important addition in Luke (on which see Luke v. 39, and note), is obliged to change the meaning, and understand the new wine of the spirit of the Gospel. It was and is the custom in the East to carry their wine on a journey in <i>leather bottles</i>, generally of goats’ skin, sometimes of asses’ or camels’ skin.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTBQ6pYry4cx0ypXqtyPODDC7h_qDtny/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In Luke and Mark this miracle follows immediately after the casting out of the devils at Gadara, and our Lord’s recrossing the lake to Capernaum ; but without any precise note of time as here. He may well have been by the sea (as seems implied by Mark and Luke), when the foregoing conversation with the disciples of John and the Pharisees took place. The account in the text is the most concise of the three ; both Mark and Luke, but especially the latter, giving many additional particulars. The miracle forms a very instructive point of comparison between the three Gospels.<h2><u><b>18. a certain ruler</b>]</u></h2> A <i>ruler of the synagogue</i>, named Jaeirus. In all except the connecting words, “<i>while he spake these things unto them,</i>” the account in the text is summary, and deficient in particularity. I have therefore reserved full annotation for the account, in Luke, which see throughout.<h3><u><b>is even now dead</b>]</u></h3> She was <i>not dead</i>, but <i>dying</i>; at the last extremity. St. Matthew, omitting the message from the ruler’s house (Mark v. 35: Luke viii. 49), gives the matter summarily in these words.<h2><u><b>20.</b>]</u></h2> The “<b>hem,</b>” see ref. Num., was the fringe or tassel which the Jews were commanded to wear on each corner of their outer garment, as a sign that they were to be holy unto God. The article, as in ch. xiv. 36, designates the particular tassel which was touched.<h2><u><b>22.</b>]</u></h2> The cure was effected on her touching our Lord’s garment, Mark v. 27–29: Luke viii. 44. And our Lord enquired who touched Him (Mark, Luke), for He perceived that virtue had gone out of Him (Luke). She, knowing what had been done to her, came fearing and trembling, and told Him all.<h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> No inference can be drawn from <i>these words</i> as to the fact of the maiden’s actual death; for our Lord uses equivalent words respecting Lazarus (John xi. 11). And if it be answered that there He explains the sleep to <i>mean death</i>, we answer, that this explanation is only in consequence of the disciples misunderstanding his words. In both cases the words are most probably used <i>with reference to the speedy awaken- ing which was to follow</i>; “Think not the damsel dead, but sleeping; for she shall soon return to life.” Luke: appends, after “<i>they laughed him to scorn,</i>’ —“<i>knowing that she was dead,</i>” in which words there is at least no recognition by the Evangelist of a mere apparent death. <b>25.</b>] <b>took her by the hand</b> is common to the three Evangelists. From Luke we learn that our Lord said “<i>Maid, arise;</i>” from Mark we have the words He actually uttered, Talitha Cum: from both we learn that our Lord only took with him Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the maiden,—that she was twelve years old,—and that our Lord commanded that something should be given<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14YyJgm2jxaAG0DoThI4lvU2YVYZX0tC3/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is remarkable that, in all the three narratives of giving sight to the blind in this Gospel, the title <b>Son of David</b> appears.<h2><u><b>28. the house</b>]</u></h2> perhaps, as Euthymius, the house of some disciple. Or, the house which our Lord inhabited at Capernaum ; or perhaps the expression need not mean any particular house, merely, as we sometimes use the expression, <i>the house</i>, as opposed to <i>the open air.</i><h3><u><b>to do this</b>]</u></h3> i.e. the healing, implied in “<i>have mercy on us.</i>”<h2><u><b>29.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Touching</i>, or <i>anointing</i> the eyes, was the ordinary method which our Lord took of impressing on the blind the action of the divine power which healed them. Ch. xx. 34: Mark viii. 25: John ix. 6. In this miracle however we have this peculiar feature, that no direct word of power passes from our Lord, but a relative concession, making that which was done <i>a measure of the faith</i> of the blind men: and from the result the degree of their faith appears. Stier remarks, “We may already notice, in the history of this first period of our Lord’s ministry, that, from having at first yielded immediately to the request for healing, He begins, by degrees, to prove and exercise the faith of the applicants.”<h2><u><b>30. straitly charged</b>]</u></h2> The word is said to mean “<i>to command with threatening,</i>” “<i>to enjoin austerely.</i>” The purpose of our Lord’s earnestness appears to have been twofold: (1) that He might not be so occupied and overpressed with applications as to have neither time nor strength for the preaching of the Gospel: (2) to prevent the already-excited people from taking some public measure of recognition, and thus arousing the malice of the Pharisees before His hour was come.<br><br>No doubt the two men were guilty of an act of disobedience in thus breaking the Lord’s solemn injunction: for obedience is better than sacrifice; the humble observance of the word of the Lord, than the most laborious and wide-spread will-worship after man’s own mind and invention. Trench (Miracles, p.197) well remarks, that the fact of almost all the Romish interpreters having applauded this act, “is very characteristic, and rests on very deep differences.”<h2><u><b>32—34.</b>]</u></h2> HEALING OF A DUMB DÆMONIAC. <i>Peculiar to Matthew</i>. The word <b>as they went out</b> places this miracle in direct connexion with the foregoing. This narration has a singular affinity with that in ch. xii. 22, or still more with its parallel in Luke xi. 14. In both, the same expression of wonder follows; the same calumny of the Pharisees; only that in ch. xii. the dæmoniac is said (not in Luke xi.) to have been likewise blind. These circumstances, coupled with the immediate connexion of <i>this </i>miracle with the cure of the blind men, and the mention of ‘the Son of David’ in both, have led some to suppose that the account in ch. xii. is a repetition, or slightly differing version of the account in our text, intermingled also with the preceding healing of the blind. But the supposition seems unnecessary,— as, the habit of the Pharisees once being to ascribe our Lord’s expulsion of devils to Beelzebub, the repetition of the re- mark would be natural:–and the other<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DyHwK6RgaoiO4SE42KU08CHdGptiB8KZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In the same way as ch. iv, 23—25 intro- duces the Sermon on the Mount, so do these verses the calling and commissioning of the Twelve. These <i>general descriptions</i> of our Lord’s going about and teaching at once <i>remove all exactness of date from the occurrence which follows</i>— as taking place at some time during the circuit and teaching just described. Both the Sermon on the Mount and this discourse are introduced and closed with these marks of indefiniteness as to time. This being the case, we must have recourse to the other Evangelists, by whose account it appears (as indeed may be imlied in ch. x. 1), that the Apostles <i>had called to their distinct office some time before this</i>. (See Mark iii. 16: Luke vi. 13.) After their calling, and selection, they probably remained with our Lord for some time before they were sent out upon their mission.<h2><u><b>36. the multitudes</b>]</u></h2> Wherever He went, in all the cities.<h3><u><b>harassed</b>]</u></h3> plagued,—viz. literally, with weariness in following Him ; or spiritually, with the tyranny of the Scribes and Pharisees, their <i>heavy burdens</i>, ch. xxii. 4,<h3><u><b>scattered abroad</b>]</u></h3> neglected, cast hither and thither, as sheep would be who had wandered from their pasture. The context shews that our Lord’s compassion was excited by their being without competent spiritual leaders and teachers.<h2><u><b>37.</b>]</u></h2> The <i>harvest </i>was primarily that of the Jewish people, the multitudes of whom before Him excited the Lord’s compassion. Chrysostom remarks that we see not only our Lord’s freedom from vainglory, in sending out his disciples rather than drawing all notice to Himself, but His wisdom, in giving them this preliminary practice for their future work: making, as he expresses it, <i>Palestine </i>a <i>palæstra</i> for the world.<br><br>The Lord, says Chrysostom, having given this command, does not join them in such a prayer, but Himself sends them out as labourers —shewing plainly that He Himself is the Lord of the harvest, and recalling to them the Baptist’s image of the threshing-floor, and One who shall purge it.<h2><u><b>X. 1–XI. 1.</b>]</u></h2> MISSION OF THE TWELVE APOSTLES.

All seem to follow one common out-line, but fill it up very differently. The following table will shew the agreements and differences:—<br><br>[Matthew x.2. | Mark ili.16. | Lukevil4. | Actei. 19, 1| 1 Simon Peter 2 | Andrew | James Andrew 1 John 3 | James | John | James | James 4| Joho | Andrew | John | Andrew 5] Philip 6| Bartholomew | Thomas 7 | Thomas Matthew | Bartholomew 8 | Matthew _ Thomas | Matthew 9| James (the son) of Alphæus. 10 | Lebbsous Thaddeos Simon called } Simon Zelotes Zelotes 11] Simon the Cananzan I Judas (the bro.) of James. 12 | Judas Iscariotes | Judas Iscarioth | Vacant<br><br>From this it appears (1), that in all four <i>three classes</i> are enumerated, and that each class contains (assuming at present the identity of Lebbæus with Thaddæus, and of Thaddæus with Judas (the brother of James), the <i>same persons</i> in all four, but in different order, with the following exceptions:—that (2) <i>Peter, Philip, James </i>(the son?) <i>of Alph</i>æ<i>us</i>, and <i>Judas Iscariot</i> hold the same places in all four. (3) That in the <i>first </i>class the two arrangements are (<i>a</i>) that of Matt. and Luke (Gospel),— <i>Peter</i> and <i>Andrew, brothers</i>; <i>James </i>and <i>John, brothers</i>;—i.e. according to their order of calling and connexion, and with reference to their being sent out in couples, Mark vi. 7: (<i>b</i>) Mark and Luke (Acts), —<i>Peter, James, John,</i> (the three principal,) and <i>Andrew</i>;—i.e. according to their personal pre-eminence. In the <i>second</i> class (<i>c</i>), that of Matt., Mark, and Luke (Gospel),—<i>Philip</i> and <i>Bartholomew, Mat- thew and Thomas</i>,—i.e. in <i>couples</i>: (<i>d</i>) Luke (Acts),—<i>Philip, Thomas, Barth. Matthew</i> (reason uncertain). In the <i>third</i> class (<i>e</i>), Matt. and Mark,—<i>James</i> (the son?) <i>of Alph</i>æ<i>us </i>and (<i>Lebb.</i>) <i>Thaddeus, Simon the Canan</i>æ<i>an and Judas Iscariot</i>; i.e. in <i>couples</i>: (<i>f</i>) Luke (Gosp. and Acts) <i>James</i> (the son?) <i>of Alph</i>æ<i>us, Simon Zelo- tes, Judas</i> (the brother?) <i>of James and Judas Iscariot</i> (uncertain). (<i>g</i>) Thus in <i>all four</i>, the leaders of the three classes are <i>the same</i>, viz. <i>Peter, Philip, and James</i> (the son?) <i>of Alph</i>æ<i>us</i>; and the traitor is always last. (4) It would appear then that the only difficulties are these two: the identity of Lebbæus with Thaddæus, and with Judas (the brother?) of James, and of Simon the Cananæan with Simon Zelotes. These will be discussed under the names.<h3><u><b>The first</b>]</u></h3> Not only as regards arrangement, or mere priority of calling, but as first in rank among equals. This is clearly shewn from James and John and Andrew being set next, and Judas Iscariot the last, in all the catalogues. We find Simon Peter, not only in the lists of the Apostles, but also in their history, prominent on various occasions before the rest. Sometimes he <i>speaks in their name</i> (Matt. xix. 27: Luke xii. 41); sometimes <i>answers when all are addressed</i> (Matt. xvi. 16 ||); sometimes our Lord addresses him as <i>principal</i>, even among the three favoured ones (Matt. xxvi. 40: Luke xxii. 31); sometimes he is addressed by others as <i>representing the whole</i> (Matt. xvii. 24: Acts ii. 37). He appears as the <i>organ of the Apostles</i> after our Lord’s ascension (Acts i. 15; ii. 14; iv. 8; v. 29): the first speech, and apparently that which decided the Council, is spoken by him, Acts xv. 7. All this accords well with the bold and energetic character of Peter, and originated in the unerring discernment and appointment of our Lord Himself, who saw in him a person adapted to take precedence of the rest in the founding of His Church, and shutting (Acts v. 3, 9) and opening (Acts ii. 14, 41; x. 5, 46) the doors of the kingdom of Heaven.

For (1) <i>no trace of such a pre-eminence is found in all the Epistles of the other Apostles</i>; but when he is mentioned, it is either, as 1 Cor. ix. 5, as one of the Apostles, one example among many, but in no wise the chief;—or as in Gal. ii. 7, 8, with a distinct account of a peculiar province of duty and preaching being allotted to him, viz. the apostleship of the circumcision (see 1 Pet. i. 1,) as distinguished from Paul, to whom was given the apostleship of the uncircumcision;—or as in Gal. ii. 9, as one of the principal <i>pillars</i>, together with James and John;—or as in Gal. ii, 11, as subject to rebuke from Paul as from an equal. And (2) <i>wherever by our Lord Himself the future constitution of His Church is alluded to, or by the Apostles its actual constitution, no hint of any such primacy is given</i> (see note on Matt. xvi. 18), but the whole college of Apostles are spoken of as absolutely equal. Matt. xix. 27, 28; xx. 26, 28: Eph. ii. 20, and many other places. Again (3) <i>in the two Epistles which we have from his own hand, there is nothing for, but every thing against, such a supposition</i>. He exhorts the presbyters as being their co-presbyter (1 Pet. v. 1): describes himself as a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: addresses his second Epistle to them that have obtained the like precious faith with ourselves (2 Pet. i. 1): and makes not the slightest allusion to any pre-eminence over the other Apostles.<br><br>So that <b>first </b>here must be understood as signifying the prominence of Peter among the Apostles, as well as his early calling.

They did not however from that time constantly accompany Him, but received a more solemn calling (see Matt. iv. 17–22: Luke v. 1–11)— i the narrative of which Peter is prominent, and so <i>first </i>called as an Apostle, at least of those four.<h3><u><b>James (the son) of Zebedee, and John his brother</b>]</u></h3> Partners in the fishing trade with Peter and Andrew, Luke v. 10.<h2><u><b>3. Philip, and Bartholomew</b>]</u></h2> Philip was called by our Lord the second day after the visit of Andrew and John, and the day after the naming of Peter. He was also of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter, James and John.<br><br>Andrew and Philip are Greek names. See John xii. 20 —22.<br><br><b>Bartholomew</b>, i.e. in Heb., <i>son of Talmai or Tolom</i>æ<i>us</i>, has been generally supposed to be the same with <i>Nathanael of Cana in Galilee</i>; and with reason: for (1) the name Bartholomew is not his own name, but a patronymic:—(2) He follows next in order, as <i>Nathanael</i>, in John i. 46, to the Apostles just mentioned, with the same formula which had just been used of Philip’s own call (ver. 44),—“<i>Philip findeth Nathanael:</i>”—(3) He is there, as here, and in Mark and Luke (Gospel), <i>in connexion with Philip</i> (that he was his <i>brother</i>, was conjectured by Dr. Donaldson; but rendered improbable by the fact that John, in the case of Andrew a few verses above, expressly says “<i>he findeth his own brother Simon,</i>” whereas in ver. 46 no such specification occurs):—(4) in John xxi. 2, at the appearance of our Lord on the shore of the sea of Tiberias, Nathanael is mentioned as present, where seven apostles (“<i>disciples</i>”) are recounted.<h3><u><b>Thomas, and Matthew the Publican</b>]</u></h3> Thomas, in Greek Didymus (the twin). John xi. 16; xx. 24; xxi. 2.<br><br><b>Matthew the publican</b> is clearly by this appellation identified with the Matthew of ch. ix. 9. We hear nothing of him, except in these two passages. Dr. Donaldson believed Matthew and Thomas to have been twin brothers. Eusebins preserves a tradition that Thomas’s real name was Judas.<h3><u><b>James (the son) of Alphæus</b>]</u></h3> From John xix. 25, some infer (but see note there), that Mary the (wife) of Clopas was sister of Mary the mother of our Lord. From Mark xv. 40, that Mary was the mother of James “<i>the little,</i>” which may be this James. Hence it would appear, if these two passages point to the same person, that Alphæus = Clopas.

It is united by definite marks of date with what goes before; and by intimate connexion with what follows. It cannot by any unfairness be severed from its context. Nor again is there any thing mentioned which casts a doubt on the reality of the appearances (see below, on vision, ver. 9). The persons mentioned <i>were seen all—spoke—and were recognized.</i> The concurrence between the three Evangelists is exact in all the circumstances, and the fourth alludes, not obscurely, to the event, which it was not part of his purpose to relate; John i. 14. Another of the three spectators distinctly makes mention of the facts here related, 2 Pet. i. 16—18. I cannot but add, having recently returned from the sight of the wonderful original at Rome, that the great last picture of Raffaelle is one of the best and noblest comments on this portion of the Gospel history. - The events passing, at the same time, on, and under, the Mount of Transfiguration, are by the painter combined, to carry to the mind of the spectator the great central truth, <i>There is none but Christ to console and to glorify our nature.</i> It is a touching reflection, that this picture was left unfinished by the painter, and carried in his funeral procession. <h2><u><b>1.]</u></h2> </b><i>“About an eight days after these sayings,”</i> Luke ix. 28. The one computation is inclusive, the other not ; or perhaps, from the <i>“about”</i> being inserted, the one is precise, the other roughly stated. The time of the transfiguration was probably <i>night</i>, for the following reasons. (1) St. Luke informs us that the Lord had gone up to the mount <i>to pray</i>; which He usually did at night (Luke vi. 12; xxi. 87; xxii. 89: Matt. xiv. 28, 24 al.). (2) All the circumstances connected with the glorification and accompanying appearances would thus be more prominently seen. (3) The Apostles were <i>asleep</i>, and are described, Luke, ver. 32, as <i>‘having kept awake through it.’</i> (4) They <i>did not descend till the next day</i> (Luke, ver. 37), which would be almost inexplicable had the event happened by day, but a matter of course if by night.<h3><u><b>an high mountain]</u></h3></b> The situation of this mountain is uncertain. It was probably not Tabor, according to the legend; for on the top of Tabor then most likely stood a fortified town (De Wette, from Robinson). Nor is there any likelihood that it was Panium, near Caesarea Philippi, for the six days would probably be spent in journeying; and they appear immediately after to have come to Capernaum. It was most likely one of the mountains bordering the lake. St. Luke speaks of it merely as <i>“the mountain”</i> (country). Stanley, Sinai and Palestine, p. 399, contends for Hermon: as does, though doubtingly, Dr. Thomson, The Land and the Book, p. 231. Stanley thinks that our Lord would still be in the neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi: and that “it is impossible to look up from the plain to the towering of Hermon, almost the only mountain which deserves the name in Palestine, and one of whose ancient titles (‘the lofty peak’) was derived from this very circumstance, and not be struck with its appropriateness to the scene.... High up on its southern slopes there must be many a point where the disciples could be taken ‘apart by themselves.’ Even the transient comparison of the celestial splendour with the snow, where alone it could be seen in Palestine, should not perhaps be wholly overlooked.” <h2><u>2.]</u></h2> <b>was transfigured</b> =<i>“the fashion of his countenance was altered,”</i> Luke. In what way, is not stated; but we may conclude from what follows, by being lighted with radiance both from without and from within.<br><br><b>white as the light</b> = <i>“white and glistening,”</i> Luke; = <i>“exceeding while [as snow] so as no fuller on earth can white them,”</i> Mark. <h2><u><b>3.]</u></h2> </b>There need be no question concerning the <i>manner</i> of the recognition of Moses and Elias by the disciples: it may have been intuitive and immediate. We can certainly not answer with Olshausen, that it may have arisen from subsequent information derived from our Lord, for Peter's words in the next verse preclude this. St. Luke adds, <i>“who appeared in glory, and spake of his decease, which he should accomplish in Jerusalem.” </i><h2><u><b>4.]</u></h2></b> St. Luke inserts, that the Apostles <i>had been asleep,</i> but wakened through this whole occurrence ; — thereby<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yxp0W2QZGN4WmCnygBW8iHbKnzit9Epy/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

St. Luke, without mentioning the condition of time imposed on them, remarkably confirms it by saying, <i>“they told no man in those days... .”</i><h2><u>10.]</u></h2> The occasion of this enquiry was, that they had just seen Elias withdrawn from their eyes, and were enjoined not to tell the vision. How <i>then</i> should this be? If this was not the coming of Elias, <i>was he yet to come?</i> If it was, how was it so <i>secret</i> and so short? <br><br>On ver. 12, see note on ch. xi. 14. <br><br>Our Lord speaks here plainly <i>in the future,</i> and uses the very word of the prophecy Mal. iv. 6, The <i>double</i> allusion is only the assertion that the Elias (in spirit and power) who foreran our Lord’s first coming, was a partial fulfilment of the great prophecy which announces the <i>real Elias</i> (the words of Malachi will hardly bear any other than a personal meaning), who is to forerun His greater and second coming. <h2><u>14—21.]</u></h2> HEALING oF A POSSESSED Lunatio.

Peter answered in the affirmative, probably because he had known it paid before. <h2><u><b>25, 26.</b>]</u></h2> The whole force of this argument depends on the fact of the payment being a <i>divine one</i>. It rests on this: ‘If the <i>sons are free,</i> then on <i>Me,</i> being the <i>Son of God,</i> has this tax no claim.’ <br><br><b>tribute</b> is here the rendering of <i>census</i>, money’ taken according to the reckoning of the <i>census</i>,<b>—</b><i>a capitation tax.</i> <br><br><b>strangers,</b> all who are not their children, those out of their family.<h2><u><b>27.</b>]</u></h2> In this, which has been pronounced the most difficult miracle in the Gospels, the deeper student of our Lord’s life and actions will find no difficulty. Our Lord’s words amount to this:<b>—</b>“that, notwithstanding this immunity, <i>we</i> (graciously including the Apostle in the earthly payment, and omitting the distinction between them, which was not now to be told to any), that we may not offend them, will pay what is required<b>—</b>and shall find it furnished by God’s special providence for us.” In the foreknowledge and power which this miracle implies, the Lord recalls Peter to that great confession (ch. xvi. 16), which his hasty answer to the collectors shews him to have again in part forgotten. <br><br>Of course the miracle is to be understood in its literal historic sense. The <i>rationalistic</i> interpretation, that the fish was to be sold for the money (and a wonderful price it would be for a fish caught with a hook), is refuted by the terms of the narrative,<b>—</b>and the <i>mythical</i> one, besides the utter inapplicability of all mythical interpretation to any part of the evangelic history,<b>—</b>by the absence of all possible occasion, and all possible significancy, of such a myth. <br><br>The stater = <i>four drachmas<b>—</b></i>the exact payment required for two persons.<br><br>for, literally, instead of, because the payment was a redemption paid for the person, Exod. xxx. 12.

Peter had returned from his fishing: see ver. 21. The dispute had taken place before, on the way to Capernaum. It had probably been caused by the mention of the Kingdom of God as at hand in ch. xvi. 19, 28, and the preference given by the Lord to the Three. In Mark it is our Lord <i>who asks them what they were disputing about,</i> and they are silent. <br><br><b>At that same time</b> need not necessarily refer to the incident last related.

Without this they should not only not be pre-eminent in, but not even admitted into, the Christian state — the Kingdom of Heaven. <br><br>4.) Not <i>“as this little child humbleth itself :”</i> the child was <i>naturally humble</i>: and such as the child was by nature, we are to be by choice.<h2><u>5.]</u></h2> Having shewn the child as the pattern of humility, the Lord proceeds to shew the honour in which children are held in His heavenly kingdom; and not only actual, but <i>spiritual</i> children — for both are understood in the expression one such little child.

St. Luke however goes on no farther with the discourse: St. Mark inserts also our ch. x. 42. The punishment here mentioned, <i>drowning,</i> may have been practised in the sea of Galilee: see Jerome cited in my Gr. Test. De Wette however denies this, saying that it was not a Jewish punishment; but it certainly was a Roman, for Suetonius mentions it as practised by Augustus on the rapacious attendants of Caius Caesar: and on a certain Macedonian also: see as above.<h3><u>millstone]</u></h3> the word implies a stone longing, to a mill <i>turned by an ass,</i> and therefore larger than the stones of a hand-mill.<h2><u>7.]</u></h2> See 1 Cor. xi. 19.

We must remember with what the discourse began — a contention who should be greatest among them: and the <b>little ones</b> are those who are the furthest from these ‘greatest,’ the humble and new-born babes of the spiritual kingdom. And despise must be understood of that kind of contempt which ambition for superiority would induce for those who are by weakness or humility incapacitated for such a strife. There is no doubt that <i>children are included</i> in the word <b>little ones</b>, as they are always classed with the humble and simple-minded, and their character held up for our imitation. The <i>little children</i> in the outward state of the Church are in fact the only disciples who are sure to be that in reality, which their Baptism has put upon them, and so exactly answer to the wider meaning here conveyed by the term; and those who would in afterlife enter into the kingdom must turn back, and become as these little children — as they were when they had just received the new life in Baptism. The whole discourse is in deep and constant reference to the <i>covenant with infants</i>, which was to be made and ratified by an ordinance, in the Kingdom of Heaven, just as then. <br><br>On the reason assigned in the latter part of this verse, there have been many opinions ; some of which (e.g. that given Webster and Wilkinson, ‘<b>angels</b>, their <i>spirits</i> after death :’ a meaning which the word never bore, and one respecting which our Lord would not have spoken in the present tense, with <b>always</b>) have been broached merely to evade the plain sense of the words, which is—that <i>to individuals</i> (whether invariably, or under what circumstances of minor detail, we are not informed) <i>certain angels are allotted as their especial attendants and guardians.</i> We know elsewhere from the Scriptures, both of the Old and New Testament (Ps. xxxiv. 7; xci. 11: Heb. i. 14 al.), that the angels do <i>minister about the children of God: </i>and what should forbid that in this service, a <i>prescribed order</i> and <i>appointed duty</i> should regulate their ministrations ? Nay, is it not certain by analogy that such would be the case? But this saying of our Lord assures us that such <i>is</i> the case, and that those angels whose honour is high before God are entrusted with the charge of the humble and meek,—the children in age and the children in grace. <br><br>The phrase <b>I say unto you,</b> as in Luke xv. 7, 10, is an introduction to a revelation of some previously unknown fact in the spiritual world. <br><br>Stier has some very beautiful remarks on the guardian angels, and on the present general neglect of the doctrine of angelic tutelage, which has been doubtless a reaction from the idolatrous angel-worship of the Church of Rome (see Acts xii, 15: Daniel xii. 1: in the former case we have an individual, in the latter a national guardianship). <br><br><b>behold the face, &c.</b> i.e. are in high honour before God; not perhaps <i>especially</i> so, but the meaning may be, ‘for they have angelic guardians, who always,’ &c. See Tobit xii. 15. <h2><u>11.]</u></h2> The angels are the servante and messengers of the Son of Man; and they therefore (<b>for &c.</b>) are appointed to wait on these little ones whom He came to save; and who, in their utter helplessness, are especially examples of <i>that which was lost.</i> ‘Here,’ remarks Stier, ‘is Jacob’s ladder planted before our eyes: beneath are the little ones;— then their angels ;— then the Son of Man in heaven, in whom alone man is exalted above the angels, Who, as the Great Angel of the Covenant, cometh from the Presence and Bosom of the Father;— and above Him again (ver. 14) the Father Himself, and<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LXkstQD1lTepXPCSPHNeZ033ac2sxxpz/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For similar declarations see Ezek. xviii. 28; xxxiii. 11: 2 Pet. iii. 9. The inference from this verse is—‘ then whoever despises or scandalizes one of these little ones, acts in opposition to the will of your Father in Heaven.’ Observe, when the dignity of the little ones was asserted, it was <b>my</b> <i>Father</i> ; now that a motive directly acting on the conscience of the Christian is urged, it is <b>your</b> Father.<h2><u>15—20.]</u></h2> OF THE METHOD OF PROCEEDING WITH AN OFFENDING BROTHER: AND OF THE POWER OF THE CHRISTIAN ASSEMBLY IN SUCH CASES. <h2><u>15.]</u></h2> The connexion of this with the preceding is: Our Lord has been speaking of <b>offences</b> (<b>stumbling-blocks</b>), which subject is the ground-tone of the whole discourse. One kind is, when <i>thou sinnest against another,</i> vv. 7—14. A second kind, when <i>thy brother sins against thee.</i> The remedy for the former must be, in each individual being cautious in his own person,—that of the latter, in the exercise of brotherly love, and if that fail, the authority of the congregation, vv. 15—17. Then follows an exposition of what that authority is, vv. 18—20. <br><br>On this verse see Levit. Xix. 17,18. This direction is only in case of <i>personal offence</i> against ourselves, and then the <i>injured person</i> is to <i>seek private explanation,</i> and that by <i>going to his injurer,</i> not waiting till <i>he</i> comes to apologize.<br><br><b>hast gained,</b> in the higher sense, <b>reclaimed,</b> gained for God, see reff.: and for thyself too: “for before, thou hadst lost him, having been broken off from thy society by the offence,” Euthymius. <h2><u>16.]</u></h2> The <i>first</i> attempt of brotherly love is to heal the wound, to remove the offence, <i>in secrecy</i> ; to <i>cover</i> the sin: but if this cannot be done, the <i>next</i> step is, to take two or three, still, in case of an adjustment, <i>preventing publicity ;</i> but in the other event, <i>providing sufficient legal witness.</i> See reff. and Jobn viii. 17. <br><br>Compare St. Paul’s apparent reference to these words of our Lord, 2 Cor. xiii. 1. <h2><u>17. <b>neglect to hear</b>]</u></h2> The original verb is a stronger word than this, implying something of <i>obduracy:</i> <b>refuse to hear.</b> <br><br><b>the church</b> (literally <b>assembly</b>), by what follows, certainly not ‘the Jewish synagogue’ (for how could vv. 18—20 be said in any sense of it?), but <b>the congregation</b> of Christians ; i.e. in early times, such as in Acts iv. 82, the one congregation,—in after times, that congregation of which thou and he are members. That it cannot mean <i>the Church as represented by her rulers,</i> appears by vv. 19, 20,— where any collection of believers is gifted with the power of deciding in such cases. Nothing could be further from the spirit of our Lord’s command than proceedings in what are oddly enough called ‘ecclesiastical’ courts.<h3><u><b>let him be, &c.</b>]</u></h3> ‘let him no longer be accounted as a brother, but as one of those without,’ as the Jews accounted Gentiles and Publicans.

This refers to that entire accordance of hearty faith, which could hardly have place except also in accordance with the divine will. It was apparently misunderstood by the Apostles James and John ;—see St. Mark’s account, ch. x, 36, in which they nearly repeat these words.

See Luke xvii. 3,4. It is possible that Peter may have asked this question in virtue of the power of the keys before (ch. xvi. 19) entrusted to him, to direct him in the use of them: but it seems more likely, that it was asked as in the person of any individual: that Peter wished to follow the rules just laid down, but felt a difficulty as to the limit of his exercise of forgiveness.<br><br>The Rabbinical rule was, to forgive <i>three times and no more ;</i> this they justified by Amos i. 3, &c., Job xxxiii, 29, 30 LXX, and marg. E. V. The expression ‘seven times a day’ is found Prov. xxiv. 16, in connexion with sinning and being restored: see also Levit. xxvi. 18—28. In our Lord’s answer we have most likely a reference to Gen. iv. 24, <h2><u><b>22.</b>]</u></h2> On <b>seventy times seven,</b> Chrysostom remarks,*that our Lord does not here lay down a number, but prescribes that which is infinite and continuous and everlasting. <h2><u><b>23.

See Isa. i. 18.<h2><u><b>24.]</u></h2></b> Whether these are talents of silver or of gold, the debt represented is enormous, and far beyond any private man’s power to discharge. 10,000 talents of silver is the sum at which Haman reckons the revenue derivable from the destruction of the whole Jewish people, Esth. iii. 9, Trench remarks (Parables, p. 124) that we can best appreciate the sum by<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hdO7CaaKNKpZ8Tc1F8J2Ytsm71zFUaMI/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In the construction of the tabernacle, twenty-nine talents of gold were used (Exod. xxxviii. 24): David prepared for the temple 3000 talents of gold, and the princes 5000 (1 Chron. xxix. 4 — 7 : the Queen of Sheba presented to Solomon 120 talents (1 Kings x. 10): the King of Assyria laid on Hezekiah thirty talents of gold (2 Kings xviii. 14): and in the extreme impoverishment to which the land was brought at last, one talent of gold was laid on it, after the death of Josiah, by the King of Egypt (2 Chron. xxxvi. 3). <h2><u><b>25.]</u></h2></b> See Exod. xxii. 3 : Levit. xxv. 39, 47: 2 Kings iv. 1. The similitude is however rather from Oriental despotism : for the selling was under the Mosaic law softened by the liberation at the year of jubilee. The imprisonment also, and the tormentors, vv. 30, 34, favour this view, forming no part of the Jewish law. <h2><u><b>26.]</u></h2></b> Luther explains this as the voice of mistaken self-righteousness, which when bitten by sense of sin and terrified with the idea of punishment, runs hither and thither, seeking help, and imagines it can build up a righteousness before God without having yet any idea that God Himself will help the sinner. Trench remarks, “It seems simpler to see in the words nothing more than exclamations characteristic of the extreme fear and anguish of the moment, which made him ready to promise impossible things, even mountains of gold,” p. 127. <h2><u><b>28.]</u></h2></b> Perhaps we must not lay stress on <b>went out,</b> as indicating any wrong frame of mind already begun, as some do :— the sequel shews how completely he had ‘gone out’ from the presence of his Lord. At all events the word corresponds to the time when the trial of our principle takes place: when we ‘go out’ from the presence of God in prayer and spiritual exercises, into the world. We may observe, that <i>forgiveness of sin</i> does not imply <i>a change of heart or principle in the sinner. </i><br><br>The fellow-servant is probably not in the same station as himself, but none the less a fellow-servant. The insignificance of the sum is to shew us how trifling any offence against one another is in comparison to the vastness of our sin against God. Chrysostom finely remarks: “He paid no regard even to the words by which he owed his own deliverance,—the petition which won for him the forgiveness of those ten thousand talents: he recognized not the harbour where he escaped his impending shipwreck: the posture of the suppliant did not remind him of his lord’s kindness : but rejecting all such considerations in his avarice and his cruelty and his unforgiveness, he was more cruel than wild beast seizing and throttling his fellow-servant. What doest thou, O man? Seest thou not that thou art exacting from <i>thyself?</i> drawing the sword against <i>thyself,</i> retorting upon thyself the denial, and refusing for thyself the free forgiveness ?”<br><br><b>that thou owest</b> must be understood as a haughty expression of one ashamed to meet the mention of the paltry sum really owing, and by this very expression generalizing his unforgiving treatment to all<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1laqwb6SoxkwkQ1pBRLcHnhtLuPrfEgPt/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

So Chrysostom, “that is, forever ; for he will never repay.” See note on ch. v. 26. <br><br>There is a difficulty made, from the punishment of this debtor for <i>the very debt which had been forgiven,</i> and the question has been asked, ‘ whether sins once remitted come back again.’ But it is the spiritual meaning which has here ruled the form of the parable. He who falls from a state of grace falls into a state of condemnation, and is overwhelmed with ‘all that debt,’ not of this or that actual sin formerly remitted, but of a <i>whole state</i> of enmity to God. <br><br>Meyer well remarks, that the motive held up in this parable could only have full light cast on it by the great act of Atonement which the Lord was about to accomplish.

As Augustine says, ‘God said by man that which man foretold.’ <br><br>(4) That the force of the argument consists in the <i>previous unity</i> of male and female, not indeed organically, but by implication, in Adam. Thus it is said in Gen. i, 27, <b>He made them</b> (man, as a race) <b>male</b> (not a male) <b>and female</b> (not, <i>man and woman</i>) : but <i>then</i> the male and female were implicitly shut up in one ; and therefore after the creation of woman from man, when one man and one woman were united in marriage they should be <i>one flesh,</i> <i>because</i> woman was taken out of man. The answer then is, that <i>abstractedly,</i> from the nature of marriage, <i>it is indissoluble.</i> The words <b>they twain</b> are in the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch, but not in the Hebrew. <h2><u><b>5. one flesh]</u></h2></b> Stier remarks, that the essential bond of marriage consists <i>not in unity of spirit and soul,</i> by which indeed the marriage state should ever be hallowed and sweetened, but without which it still exists in all its binding power :— the wedded pair are ONE FLESH, i. e. ONE MAN <i>within the limits of their united life in the flesh,</i> <i>for this world :</i> beyond this limit, the marriage is broken by the <i>death of the flesh.</i> And herein alone lies the justification of a <i>second</i> marriage, which in no way breaks off the unity of love in spirit with the former partner, now deceased. <h2><u><b>7 — 9.]</u></h2></b> In this second question, the Pharisees imagine that they have overthrown our Lord’s decision by a <i>permission </i>of the law, which they call a <i>command</i> (compare ver. 7 with ver. 8). But He answers them that this was done by Moses <i>on account of their hardness and sinfulness, as a lesser of evils,</i> and belonged to that dispensation which <i>entered,</i> Rom. v. 20; <i>was added because of transgressions,</i> Gal. iii. 19. This He expresses by the <b>your</b> and <b>you,</b> as opposed to the general terms used before. Only that <b>fornication,</b> which <i>itse[f breaks marriage,</i> can be a ground for dissolving it. The question, whether demonstrated <i>approaches</i> to fornication, short of the act itself, are to be regarded as having the same power, must be dealt with cautiously, but at the same time with full remembrance that our Lord does not confine the guilt of such sins to the outward act only: see ch. v. 28. St. Mark gives this last verse (9) as spoken <i>to the disciples in the house ;</i> and his minute accuracy in such matters of detail is well known.

Some expositors (principally modern) have fallen into the mistake of supposing that the dictum applies to the marrying a woman divorced on account of fornication. But the full English way of rendering the sentence, would be, <b>a woman thus divorced,</b> viz. not on account of fornication. <h2><u><b>10.]</u></h2> the case,</b> not the cause of divorce just mentioned; nor, the condition of the man with his wife: but <b>the account to be given,</b> <i>‘the original ground and principle,’</i> of the relationship of man and wife. The disciples apprehend that the trials and temptations of marriage would prove sources of sin and misery. This question and its answer are peculiar to Matthew. <h2><u><b>11, 12.]</u></h2> this saying,</b> viz. <b>of yours.</b> The <b>for</b> in ver. 12 shews that the sense is carried on. <br><br>Our Lord mentions the <i>three exceptions,</i> the <i>to whom it is given not to marry.</i> 1. Those who from natural incapacity, or if not that, inaptitude, <i>have no tendencies</i> towards marriage: 2. Those who by actual physical deprivation, or compulsion from men, <i>are prevented</i> from marrying: 3. Those who in order to do the work of God more effectually (as e.g. St. Paul), <i>abstain</i> from marriage, see 1 Gor. ii, 26. The <b>eunuchs</b> and <b>made eunuchs</b> in the two first cases are to be taken both literally and figuratively: in the latter, figuratively only. It is to be observed that our Lord does not here utter a word from which any superiority can be attributed to the state of celibacy: the imperative in the last clause being not a command but a permission, as in Rev. xxii. 17. His estimate for us of the expediency of celibacy, as a general question, is to be gathered from the parable of the talents, where He visits with severe blame the burying of the talent for its safer custody. The remark is Neander’s, and the more valuable, as he himself lived and died unmarried.<h2><u><b>13 — 15.]</u></h2></b> THE BRINGING OF CHILDREN TO JESUS. Mark x.13—16. Luke xviii. 16—17.

The spirit in which he came,—which does not however appear here so plainly as in the other gospels, from the omission of <i>“good,”</i> and the form of our Lord’s answer,—seems to have been that of excessive admiration for Jesus as a man of eminent virtue, and of desire to know from Him by what work of exceeding merit he might win eternal life. This spirit He reproves, by replying that there is but One Good, and that the walking by His grace in the way of holiness is the path to life. On the question and answer, as they stand in the received text,—and on their doctrinal bearing, see notes to Mark. This passage furnishes one of the most instructive and palpable cases of the smoothing down of apparent discrepancies by correcting the Gospels out of one another and thus reducing them to conformity. <h2><u><b>18.]</u></h2></b> De Wette observes well, that our Lord gives this enumeration of the commandments to <i>bring out the self-righteous spirit of the young man,</i> which He before saw. He only mentions those of the second table, having in ver. 17, in His declaration respecting <i>“good,”</i> included those of the first. Mark has the addition of <i>“Defraud not,”</i> representing probably the tenth commandment. <h2><u><b>19.]</u></h2></b> The addition of <i>Thou shalt love &c.</i> is peculiar to Matthew. <h2><u><b>20.]</u></h2></b> We may remark that this young man, though self-righteous, was <i>no Hypocrite,</i> no Pharisee: he spoke earnestly, and really strove to keep, as he really believed he had kept, all God’s commandments. Accordingly St. Mark adds, that Jesus looking upon him <i>loved him:</i> in spite of his error there was a nobleness and openness about him, contrasted with the hypocritical bearing of the Pharisees and Scribes. <h2><u><b>21, 22.]</u></h2></b> Our Lord takes him on his own shewing. As St. Mark and St. Luke add, <i>“One thing is wanting to thee.”</i> Supposing thy statement true, this topstone has yet to be laid on the fabric. But then it is to be noticed, that part of that one thing is Come and follow me (<i>taking up thy cross,</i> Mark). Stier remarks, that this was a test of his observance of the <i>first commandment</i> of the first table: of breaking which he is by the result convicted.<h2><u><b>24.]</u></h2></b> Lightfoot brings instances from the Talmud of similar proverbial expressions regarding an <i>elephant:</i> we have a case in ch. xxiii. 24, of a <i>camel</i> being put for any thing very large: and we must remember that the object here was to set forth the greatest haman impossibility,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l2OryjuawnFT57W7OfRVXldj8FIps1MR/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

He does not ask respecting <i>salvation,</i> but <i>some</i> <i>pre-eminent reward,</i> as is manifest by the answer. The ‘all’ which the Apostles had left, was not in every case contemptible. The sons of Zebedee had hired servants (Mark i. 20), and Levi (Matthew ?) could make a great feast in his house, But whatever it was, it <i>was their all.</i><h2><u><b>28—30.]</u></h2></b> We may admire the <i>simple truthfulness</i> of this answer of our Lord. He does not hide from them their reward: but tells them prophetically, that in the new world, the accomplishment of that regeneration which He came to bring in (see Acts iii. 21: Rev. xxi. 5: Matt. xxvi. 29), when He should sit on His throne of glory, then they also should sit (see in my Greek Test. on the peculiar force of the two different forms of the verb sit, as applied to our Lord, sitting on His throne as His own act, and to the Apostles, as being promoted to, and taking their seats on, their thrones, as the will of another) on twelve thrones judging (see ref. 1 Cor.) the twelve tribes of Israel (see Rev. xx. 4; xxi. 12, 14:—one throne, Judas’s, another took, Acts i. 20). At the same time he informs them, ver. 29, that this reward should <i>not</i> in its most blessed particulars be <i>theirs alone,</i> but that of <i>every one who should deny himself for Him</i> (see 2 Tim. iv. 8): and (ver. 30) cautions them, referring perhaps especially to Judas, but with a view to all, as appears by the following parable, that <i>many first should be last,</i> and <i>last first.</i> <br><br>On ver. 29, Stier remarks that the family relations are mentioned by St. Matthew in the order in which <i>they</i> <i>would be left.</i> On the other points requiring notice, see note on Mark x. 29, 30.<h1><u><b>CHAP.

They were not to be of such a spirit, as to imagine, with the murmurers in ver. 11, that they should have something super-eminent (because they were called first, and had laboured longest) above those who <i>in their own time</i> were to be afterward called (see 1 Cor. xv.8—11). (3) Its secondary applications are to all those to whom such comparison, of <i>first and last called, </i>will apply :— <i>nationally,</i> to the <b>Jews,</b> who were first called, and with a <i>definite covenant,</i> and the Heathens who came in afterwards, and on a covenant, though <i>really made</i> (see Jer. xxxi. 38: Zech. viii. 8: Heb. viii. 10), <i>yet not so open and prominent :—individually,</i> to those whose call has been in early life, and who have spent their days in God’s active service, and those who have been summoned later ; and to various other classes and persons between whom comparison, not only of <i>time,</i> but of advantages, talents, or any other distinguishing characteristic, can be made: that none of the first of these can boast themselves over the others, nor look for higher place and greater reward, inasmuch as there is but one “gift” of God according to the covenant of grace. And the “first” of these are to see that they do not by pride and self-righteousness become the “last,” or worse—be rejected, as nationally were the Jews; for among the many that are called, there are few chosen —many who will fail of the reward in the end. (4) In subordination to this leading idea and warning of the Parable must the circumstances brought before us be interpreted. The <i>day</i> and its <i>hours</i> are not any fixed time, such as the duration of the world, or our Lord’s life on earth, or the life of man, exclusively: but <i>the natural period of earthly work</i> as applied to the various meanings of which the parable is capable. The <i>various times of hiring</i> are not to be pressed as each having an exclusive meaning in each interpretation : they serve to spread the calling over the various periods, and to shew that it is again and again made. They are the <i>quarters</i> of the natural day, when the aliquot parts of the day’s wages could be earned, and therefore labourers would be waiting. The <i>last</i> of these is inserted for a special purpose, and belongs more expressly to the instruction of the parable. (5) The <b>hire</b> bears an important part in the interpretation. I cannot with Stier (whose comment on this le I think much inferior to his remarks) suppose it to mean “the promise of this life” attached to godliness. His anxiety to escape from the danger of <i>eternal life being matter of wages, </i>has here misled him. But there is no such danger in the interpretation of the parable which I believe to be the true one. The <b>hire</b> is the <i>promise of the covenant,</i> uniformly represented by our Lord and His Apostles as a <i>‘reward,’</i> Matt. v. 12: Luke vi. 85; xiv. 14: John iv. 86: 1 Cor. iii. 14: 2 John 8: Heb. x. 85; xi. 6 al., <i>reckoned indeed of free grace:</i> but still, forensically considered, answering to, and represented by, ‘ wages,’ as claimed under God’s covenant with man in Christ. (The freeness and sovereignty of God’s gift of grace is pointedly set before us in ver. 14, It is my will to give &c.) This <b>hire</b> I believe then to be <i>eternal life,</i> or, in other words, GOD <b>HIMSELF</b> (John xvii. 3). And this, rightly understood, will keep us from the error of supposing, that the parable involves a declaration that all who are saved will be in an absolute equality. This gift is, and will be to each man, as he is prepared to receive it. To the envious and murmurers, it will be as the fruit that turned to ashes in the mouth: by their own unchristian spirit they will “lose the things that they have wrought” (2 John 8), and their reward will be null: in other words, they will, as the spiritual verity necessitates, <i>not enter into that life to which they were called.</i> God’s covenant is fulfilled to them —they have received their denarius—but from the essential nature of the “hire” are disqualified from enjoying its use: for as Gregory the Great remarks, “the kingdom of heaven none who murmurs, inherits: none who inherits, can murmur.” To those who have known and loved God, it will be, to each, as he has advanced in the spiritual life, joy unspeakable and fall of glory. <h2><u><b>1, early in the morning]</u></h2></b> See Jer. xxxv. 14, and other places.<h3><u><b>labourers]</u></h3></b> in the primary meanings of the parable, ‘apostles, prophets, ministers:’ distinct from the <i>vines</i> in the vineyard.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QyK1n-acheGtXWRoelUZeX6fJOLf5VDR/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Polybius (but in illustrating the exceeding fertility and cheapness of the country) mentions that the charge for a day’s entertainment in the inns in Cisalpine Gaul was half an as, = 1/20th of the denarius. This we may therefore regard as liberal pay for the day’s work. <h2><u><b>3, 4]</u></h2></b> The <i>third hour,</i> at the equinox our 9 a.m., and in summer 8, was sometimes called <i>“the height of the market,”</i> — when the market was fullest.<br><br>“The market-place of the world is contrasted with the vineyard of the Kingdom of God: the greatest man of business in worldly things is a mere idle gazer, if he has not yet entered on the true work which alone is worth any thing or gains any reward.” Stier. <br><br>No positive stipulation is made with these second, but they are to depend on the justice of the house-holder.

But the variety is itself indicative of the independence of Matthew and Mark of one another. St. John used the two expressions at different times, and our witnesses have reported both.

The additional intensity of temptation at the <i>end</i> of that period, is expressed in Matthew by the tempter <i>coming</i> to Him — becoming visible and audible. Perhaps the <i>being with the beasts</i> may point to one form of temptation, viz. that of <i>terror</i>, which was practised on Him: — but of the <i>inward trials</i>, who may speak? There is nothing here to <i>contradict</i> the fast spoken of in Matthew and Luke, as some have maintained. Our Evangelist, Perhaps implies it in the last words of ver. 13. remarkable that those Commentators who are fondest of maintain- ing that Mark constructed his narrative out of those of Matthew and Luke, are also most keen in pointing out what they call irreconcilable differences between him and them. No apportionment of these details to the various successive parts of the temptation is given by our Evangelist. They are simply stated to have happened, commpendiously.<h2><u><b>14, 14.]</u></h2></b> JESUS BEGINS HIS MINISTRY. Matt. iv. 12—17.

The interpretation of this narrative given by Meyer, I believe to be an entirely mistaken one. He the strict sense of ‘<i>to make a way</i>,’ and insists on the Lae sade by our narrative being, as distinguished from those in Matthew, Luke, that the disciples <i>made a way for them- selves through the wheat field, by plucking the ears of corn</i>, further maintaining, that there is no allusion <i>here</i> to their having eaten the grains of wheat, as in Matthew, Luke. But (1) the foundation on which all this is built is insecure. The same Greek expression in the LXX does undoubtedly mean ‘<i>to make one’s journey</i>.’ And (2) as to no allusion being made to their having eaten the corn, how otherwise could the ‘<i>had need</i>’ have been common to the disciples and to David. Could it be said that any <i>necessity</i> compelled them to clear the path by pulling up the overhanging stalks of corn? How otherwise could the remarkable addition in our narrative, ver. 27, at all bear upon the case? Fritzache’s rendering, ‘to mark the way by plucking ears and strewing them in it,’ is still worse. <h2><u><b>26. he]</u></h2></b> emphatic,—<b>Himself</b>, taking up the cause of his disciples, and not leaving their defence to themselves.<h2><u><b>26.]</u></h2></b> <b>In the days of Abiathar the high priest</b>: i.e. necessarily in the original, <b>during the high priesthood of Abiathar.</b> But in 1 Sam. xxi., from which this ac- count is taken, Ahimelech, not Abiathar, is the High Priest.

Amidst this varia- tion, we can hardly undertake to explain the difficulty in the text. In some MSS. the words are omitted; in others they are altered, to give the words strictly the sense ‘In the time of Abiathar the High Priest,’ so that the difficulty might be avoided by understanding the event to have happened in the time of (but not necessarily during the high priesthood of) Abiathar (who was afterwards) the High Priest. But supposing the reading to be so, what author would in an ordinary narrative think of designating an event thus? Who for instance would speak of the defeat of the Philistines at Ephesdammim, where Goliath fell, as happening <i>in the time of David the king</i>? Who would ever understand, ‘<i>in the time of Elisaus the prophet</i>, as importing, in matter of fact, any other period than that of the <i>prophetic course</i> of Elisha?

The omission of this, wholly inexplicable if St. Mark had had either Matthew or Luke before him, belongs to the fragmentary character of his Gospel. The common accounts of the compilation of this Gospel are most capricious and absurd. In one place, St. Mark omits a discourse—‘<i>because it was not his purpose to relate discourses;</i>’ in another he gives a discourse, omitting the occasion which led to it, as here.

Matthew and Mark agree nearly verbatim; Matthew however writing throughout in the singular. Mark has some additions, e.g. <b>the sower soweth the word, ver. 14,—after “</b><i><b>the deceitfulness of riches,</b></i><b>” ver. 19, and the lusts of other things :—and some varia- tions, e.g. Satan</b> for St. Matthew's “<i>the wicked one,</i>” and St. Luke’s “<i>the devil.</i>”<br><br>Such matters are <i>not trifling</i>, because they shew the <i>gradual deflection of verbal expression</i> in different versions of the <i>same report</i>,—nor is the <i>general agreement</i> of St. Luke’s, which seems to be from a different hearer.<h2><u><b>16.]</u></h2></b> <b>likewise</b>, after the same analogy:—carrying on a like principle of interpretation.<h2><u><b>20.]</u></h2></b> Notice the concluding words of the interpretation exactly reproducing those of the parable, ver. 8, as characteristic.

By Commentators of the Straussian school. it is strangely supposed to be the same as the parable of the tares, <i>with the tares left out</i>. If so, a wonderful and most instructive parable has arisen out of the fragments of the other, in which the idea is <i>a totally different one</i>. It is, the <i>growth</i> of the once-deposited seed by the combination of its own development with the genial power of the earth, all of course under the creative hand of God, but independent of human care and anxiety during this time of growth. <h2><u><b>26.]</u></h2></b> Observe <b>said</b>, without <i>unto them</i>—implying that He is now proceeding with his teaching to the <i>people:</i> compare ver. 33. <h3><u><b>a man]</u></h3></b> Some difficulty has been felt about the interpretation of this <i>man</i>, as to whether it is <i>Christ</i> or <i>his ministers</i>. The former certainly seems to be excluded by <b>should sleep</b>, and <b>he knoweth not how</b>, ver. 27; and perhaps the latter by <b>putteth in the sickle</b>, ver. 29. But I believe the parable to be one taken simply from human things,—the sower being quite in the background, and the whole stress being on the SEED—its power and its development. The <i>man</i> then is just the farmer or husbandman, hardly admitting an <i>interpretation</i>, but necessary to the machinery of the parable.<br><br>Observe, that in this case it is not <i>his seed</i> as in Luke viii. 5,—and the agent is only hinted at in the most general way. If a meaning must be assigned, the best is “human agency” in general. <h2><u><b>27.]</u></h2></b> <b>sleep and rise— </b>i.e<i>. employs himself other- wise—goes about his ordinary occupations.</i> The seed sown in the heart is in its growth dependent on other causes than mere human anxiety and watchfulness:—on a mysterious power implanted by God in the seed and the soil combined, the working of which is hidden from human eye.<br><br>No trouble of ours can accelerate the growth, or shorten the stages through pass. <br><br>It is the mistake of modern Methodism, for instance, to be always working at the seed, <i>taking it up to see whether it ts growing</i>, instead of leaving it to God’s own good time, and meanwhile diligently doing God’s work elsewhere: see Stier, iii. p. 12.

Or we may perhaps find the reason in our Lord’s <i>immediate</i> <i>departure</i> to such a distance (ver. 27); and say, that He did not wish multitudes to gather about and follow Him.<br><br><b>when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him...</b> see above on ch. vii. 33.<br><br>We cannot say what may hare induced our Lord to form this miracle <i>at twice</i>—certainly not the reason assigned by Dr. Burton, “that a blind man would not, on suddenly recovering his sight, know one object from another, because he had never seen them before,” and so would require a double miracle;—a second to open the eyes of <i>his mind also</i>, to comprehend what he saw. This assumes the man to have been <i>born</i> blind, which he was not from ver. 24; for how should he know <i>how trees appeared?</i> and besides, the case of the man born blind in John ix. required no such double healing.

This Meyer calls <i>a contradiction to Matthew and Luke</i>,—and thinks it arose from a misunderstanding of St. Luke’s “<i>he said to them all.</i>” Far rather should I say that our account represents every detail to the life, and that the “<i>to them all</i>” contains <i>traces of it</i>.

I have already in the notes to Matthew spoken of the noble use made of this contrast in the last and grandest picture of the greatest of painters—the Transfiguration of Raffaele. <h2><u><b>15.]</u></h2></b> The Lord’s countenance probably retained traces of the glory on the mount; so strong words <b>as were greatly amazed</b> would hardly have been used merely of their surprise at His sudden approach: see Exod. xxxiv. 29, 30. <i>That</i> brightness, however, <i>terrified</i> the people: this <i>attracts</i> them: see 2 Cor. iii. 7-18. <h2><u><b>16.]</u></h2> them</b> (first time), i.e. ‘<i>the multitude</i>,’ regarding the Scribes as <i>a part of the</i> multitude. <i>One of the multitude answers. </i><h2><u><b>17.]</u></h2> unto thee—</b>i.e.<i> intended</i> to do so, not being aware of His absence.

The additional words “<i>and perverse</i>” (Matthew, Luke) are probably from Deut. xxxii. 5; see further ib. ver. 20, where “<i>faithless</i>” is also expressed by “<i>children in whom is no faith</i>.” The question is not asked in a spirit of longing to be gone from them, but of holy impatience of their hardness of heart and unbelief. In this the father, disciples, Scribes, and multitude are equally involved. <br><br>“The kingdom of Satan, in small and great, is ever stirred into a fiercer activity by the coming near of the kingdom of Christ.

Others, as Dr. Burton, suppose it to mean: —‘Believe what you have expressed by your <b>if thou canst</b>,’ &c. But both these renderings involve methods of construction and expression not usual in the Gospels. The <b>if thou canst believe</b> is a manifest reference to the <b>if thou canst do any thing</b> before, and meant to convey a reproof, as the father’s answer testifies. The sentence, also, unless I am mistaken, is meant to convey an intimation that the healing was not to be <i>an answer</i> to that challenge, so that <i>the Lord’s power</i> was to be challenged and proved,—but an answer to <i>faith</i>, which (of course by laying hold on Him who is Almighty) <i>can do all things</i>. <h2><u><b>24.]</u></h2></b> Nothing can be more touching and <i>living</i> than this whole most masterly and wonderful narrative. The poor father is drawn out into a sense of the unworthiness of his distrust, and “the little spark of faith which is kindled in his soul reveals to him the abysmal deeps of unbelief which are there.” (Trench, p. 367.) “Thus,” remarks Olshausen (B. Comm: i, 534), “does the Redeemer shew himself to the father as a Creator and bringer out of faith first, before He heals his son. In the struggle of his anxiety, the strength of Faith is <i>born</i>, by the aid of Christ, in the soul empty of it before.”<br><br>There is strong analogy in the Lord’s treatment of the father here, for the <i>sponsorial engagement</i> in infant baptism. The <i>child</i> is by its infirmity <i>incapacitated</i>; it is therefore <i>the father’s faith</i> which is tested; and when that is proved, the child is healed. The fact is, that the analogy rests far deeper: viz. on the ‘inclusion’ of ‘the old man’ in Adam and the ‘new man’ in Christ: see Rom. v. 12—21.<h2><u><b>25.]</u></h2></b> This took place at a distance from the crowd, among those who had run forward to meet our Lord, ver. 16.<h3><u><b>I charge thee]</u></h3> </b>The personal pronoun is emphatic, as opposed to the want of power on the part of the disciples. This is the only place where we have such a charge as <b>enter no more into him</b>,—shewing the excessive malignity and tenacity of this kind (see ver. 29) of spirit. This is also shewn by ver. 26. <h2><u><b>27.]</u></h2></b> See ch. v. 41; also Matt. xvii. 6, 8: Rev. i. 17: Dan. x. 9, 10. <h2><u><b>29.]</u></h2></b> The answer is given more at length in Matthew, ver. 20, and the Lord there distinctly includes the <i>disciples</i> in the faithless generation, by telling them “<i>Because of your unbelief.</i>” The assurance also occurs there, which was repeated Matt. xxi. 21, where see notes.<h3><u><b>This kind]</u></h3></b> That there are <i>kinds</i>,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HXLtG8m-sxDZyPstH8-zyglQtCnF3C9Q/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

First take St. Luke’s account.— <i>The disciples had been disputing;—our Lord knowing the strife of their hearts, took a child, &c.</i>:— then compare St. Mark—<i>our Lord asked them, on coming into a house, what had been the subject of their dispute;—they were silent from shame;—He sat down, delivered his sentence to the twelve,—and then took the child,</i> &.—Lastly turn to St. Matthew. There, <i>the disciples themselves referred the question to our Lord, and He took the child</i>, &c. Who can forbear seeing in these narratives the unfettered and independent testimony of three witnesses, consistent with one another in the highest form and spirit of truthfulness, but differing in the mere letter? St. Mark’s account is again the richest and fullest, and we can hardly doubt that if the <i>literal exact detail</i> of fact is in question, we have it here. <h2><u><b>33.]</u></h2></b> Between the coming to Capernaum, and this discourse, happened the <i>demand of the tribute-money</i>, Mt. xvii. 20–27. <h2><u><b>34.]</u></h2></b> There is no real difference in the matter in question here (and in Luke), and in Matthew.

The very.success of the miracle will awe him, and prevent him from soon or lightly speaking evil of me. <br><br>We must beware of supposing that the application of this saying is to be confined to the <i>working of a miracle</i>—ver. 40 shews that it is general—a weighty maxim of Christian toleration and charity, and caution to men how they presume to limit the work of the Spirit of God to any sect, or succession, or outward form of Church; compare Phil. i. 16–18. <h2><u><b>40.]</u></h2></b> This saying is not inconsistent with that in Matt. xii. 30. They do not refer to the sam thing. This is said of <i>outward conformity</i>— that, of <i>inward unity of purpose</i>— two widely differing things. On that saying, see note there. On this, we may say—all those who, notwithstanding: outward differences of communion and government, <i>believe in and preach </i>Jesus Christ, without bitterly and uncharitably opposing each other, are hereby declared to be <i>helpers forward of each other's work</i>. O that all Christians would remember this! Stier (Red. J. iii. 24) strongly deprecates the reading <b>us</b> and <b>our</b>: “the <b>us</b> in the mouth of our Lord here confuses and destroys nearly the whole purport of his weighty saying. For this is the very fault of the disciples, that they laid down outward and visible communion with <i>them</i> as the decisive criterion of communion with the Lord: and this very fault the Lord rebukes with his repudiatory you.” Still, there is a propriety, a tempering the rebuke with a gracious reminiscence of their unity with Him, and something exceedingly suiting the <b>belong</b> <b>to Christ</b> below, in <b>us</b> and <b>our</b>. In the divided state of the critical evidence, the reading must be ever doubtful. <h2><u><b>41.]</u></h2></b> This verse does not take up the discourse from ver. 37, as some think, but is immediately connected with ver. 40:—‘Even the <i>smallest</i> service done in my Name shall not be unrewarded—much more should not so great an one as casting out of devils be prohibited.’ <br><br>The original has <b>in the name that</b>: i.e, <b>by reason that</b>, but not without an allusion to <b>my name</b>, which furnishes the reason.<h3><u><b>ye belong to Christ]</u></h3></b> The only place in the Gospels where this expression is used.

See note on Matt. v. 22. <h2><u><b>49.]</u></h2></b> In order to understand this difficult verse, it will be necessary first to examine its connexion and composition. (1) What is <b>for</b>? It connects it with the solemn assertions in vv. 43—48, <b>it is better for thee</b>…, and furnishes a <i>reason why</i> it <b>is</b> better for us to cut off and cast away, &c.<br><br><b>every one</b> then is to be taken absolutely: referring back both to the <b>thee</b>, and the their above—<b>every sacrifice is</b> (not <i>opposed</i> to [Meyer], but) <i>parallel</i> <i>with</i> <b>every one</b>, and <b>and</b> equivalent to <b>just as</b>. (2) This being stated, let us now enquire into the symbolic terms used. FIRE, is the <i>refiner’s fire </i>of Mal. iii. 2, to which indeed there seems to be a reference; the fire of Matt. iii. 11 and Acts ii. 3; of Ezek. xxviii. 14 (see my Hulsean Lectures for 1841, pp 9–12). Fire is <i>the symbol of the divine purity and presence:</i>—our God is a <i>consuming fire</i>, not only to his foes, but to his people: but in <i>them</i>, the fire shall burn up only what is impure and requires purifying out, 1 Cor. iii. 13: 1 Pet. i. 7; iv. 12, 17. This very fire shall be to them as <i>a preserving salt</i>, The SALT of the covenant of God (Lev. ii. 18) was to be mixed with <i>every sacrifice</i>; and it is with fire that <i>all men are to be salted</i>. This fire is the divine purity and judgment <i>in the covenant</i>, whose promise is, ‘I will dwell among them.’ And in and among this purifying fire shall the people of God ever walk and rejoice everlastingly. Rev. xxi. 23. This is the right understanding of Isa. xxxiii. 14, 15, ‘Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? &c. He that walketh in righteousness,’ &c. And thus the connexion with the preceding verses is,—‘it is better for thee to cut off,’ &c.—‘for it is <i>part of the salting of thee, the living sacrifice</i> (Rom. xii. 1), that every offence and scandal must be burnt out of thee before thou canst enter into life.’ It is perhaps necessary to add that this is simply the explanation of our Lord’s words as they stand, in their symbolism and connexion. When Mr. Elliott objects to it as a ‘fearful comment,’ he has to do with <i>those words</i>, not with me. Surely, nothing but the most amazing power of misunderstanding can suppose the explanation inconsistent with such texts as Rom. viii. 1, 34: 1 John ii. 1, 2. <h2><u><b>50.]</u></h2></b> The connexion of this (elsewhere said in other references, Matt. v. 13: Luke xiv. 34) is now plain. If this fire which is to purify and act as a preserving salt to you, have, from the nullity and vapidity of the grace of the covenant in you, <i>no such power</i>,—it can only <i>consume</i>—the salt has lost its savour—the covenant is void—you will be cast out, as it is elsewhere added, and tho fire will be no longer the fire of <i>purification</i>, but of <i>wrath eternal</i>. <br><br>I will just add that the interpretation of the sacrifice as the <i>condemned</i>—and the fire and salt as <i>eternal fire</i>,—except in the case of the salt having lost its savour, <i>is contrary to the whole symbolism of</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1plrf1qt4YEeRcOFW-cOa1ZNVLldU_bQW/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

St. Matthew has “<i>beyond Jordan</i>” without the copula.

Nay, in the pride of the human intellect, this question was sure one day to be raised: and our Lord furnishes the Church, by anticipation, with an answer to it for all ages. Not only may the little infants be brought to Him,—but in order for us who are mature to come to Him, we must cast away all that wherein our maturity has caused us to differ from them, and <i>become</i> LIKE THEM. Not only is Infant Baptism <i>justified</i>, but it is (abstractedly considered;—not as to <i>preparation</i> for it, which from the nature of the case is precluded) the NORMAL PATTERN OF ALL BAPTISM; none can enter God’s kingdom, except <i>as an infant</i>. In adult baptism, the<i> exceptional case</i> (see above), we strive to secure that state of simplicity and childlikeness, which in the infant we have ready and undoubted to our hands. <h2><u><b>16.]</u></h2></b> The word may be rendered he <b>fervently blessed them</b>.<h2><u><b>17—31.]</u></h2></b> ANSWER TO AN ENQUIRER RESPECTING ETERNAL LIFE, AND DISCOURSE THEREUPON. Matt. xix. 16–30. Luke xviii. 18–30. On the different form of our Lord’s answer in Matthew, see notes there. As it here stands, so far from giving any countenance to Socinian error, it is a pointed rebuke of the very view of Christ which they who deny His Divinity entertain. He was no ‘good Master,’ to be singled out from men on account of His pre-eminence over his kind in virtue and wisdom: God sent us no such Christ as this, nor may any of the sons of men be thus called <i>good</i>. He was <i>one with Him</i> who only is good, the Son of the Father, come not to teach us merely, but to beget us anew by the divine power which dwells in Him. The low view then, which this applicant takes of Him and his office, He at once rebukes and annuls, as He had done before in the case of Nicodemus: see John iii. 1 ff. and notes.<br><br>The dilemma, as regards the Socinians, has been well put (see Stier ii. 283, note): —<i>either</i>, “There is none but God: Christ is good: therefore Christ is GOD;” —<i>or</i>, “There is none good but God: therefore Christ is not God; therefore Christ IS NOT GOOD.”<br><br>With regard to other points the variations in the narratives are trifling, but instructive—“<i>if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He saith unto Him, which?</i>” (Matthew)= “<i>thou knowest the commandments</i>” (Mark and Luke) without any break in the discourse. Similarly, in Matthew, the young (Matthew) ruler (Luke) asks, ver. 20, “<i>what lack I yet?</i>” but in Mark and Luke, Jesus says to him (and here with the remarkable addition of “<i>beholding him, loved him</i>”) “one thing thou lackest.” Such notices as these shew the point at which, not short of which nor beyond which, we<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cdzsNCq2919Xo8mTiGH5qyCXpNHTGthy/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

PREFACE ADDRESSED TO THEOPHILUS. The style of this preface is purer Greek than the contents of the Gospel, and also more labored and formal. This may be accounted for, partly because it is the composition of the Evangelist himself, and not translated from Hebrew sources like much of the rest, and partly because prefaces, especially when also dedicatory, are usually in a rounded and artificial style. 1, Much depends on the meaning of this word, as guiding, or modifying, our opinion on the relation and sources of our Gospel histories. (1) That the writers of our present Gospels exclusively cannot be meant, is evident; since, even supposing St. Luke to have seen all three Gospels, one (that of St. John) was wholly, and another (that of St. Matthew) was in greater the production of an eye-witness and minister of the word, which would leave only one for the many. (2) Apocryphal Gospels exclusively cannot be meant: for they would not be narrations concerning matters fully believed among us, nor delivered by eye- witnesses and ministers of the word, a great part of their contents being excluded by this very author from his own narra- tlon. (3) A combination of these two may be intended—e. g. of the later sort, the Gospel according to the Hebrews, of the former, that according to St. Mark, but then also how shall we make out the many? Our present apocryphal Gospels arose far later than any likely date which can be assigned to St.Lukes’ Gospel<br><br>see Introduction to Luke. (4) I believe the only probable interpretation of the words to be, that many persons, in charge of Churches, or otherwise induced, drew up, here and there, statements (narratives) of the testimony of eye-witnesses and ministers of the word (see below), so far as they themselves had been able to collect them. (I do not believe that either the Gospel of St. Matthew or that of St. Mark is to be reckoned among these; or if they are, that St. Luke had seen or used them.) That such narratives should not have come down to us, is no matter of surprise: for (1) they would be absorbed by the more complete and sanctioned accounts of our present Evangelists; and (2) Church tra- dition has preserved very few fragments of authentic information of the apostolic age. It is probable that in almost every Church where an eye-witness preached, his testimony would be taken down, and framed into some narrative, more or less complete, of the life and sayings of the Lord.This does not necessarily imply the insufficiency of such narrations, as some have imagined. The fact of that failure is indeed implied in St. Luke’s description of his own work but that, more because it possessed completeness (whereas they were fragmentary) than from any difference in kind.

The Apostles, delivered these matters orally to the Churches in their teaching (see below on ver. 4), and others drew up accounts from that catechetical instruction. It appears from this, that St. Luke was not aware of any narration drawn up by an eye-witness or minister of the word. Their account of these matters was a tradition, from which the narrations were drawn up. He can- not therefore have seen (or, having seen, not recognized as such, which is highly improbable) the Gospel of St. Matthew. Compare 1 John i. 1—3. Not, from the very beginning, i.e. the birth of the Lord, but from the official Beginning: see Acts 1: 21. It differs from the very first below.

St. Luke by this classes himself with these many, and shews that he intended no disparagement nor blame to them, and was going to construct his own history from similar sources. The words which follow imply however a conscious superiority of his own qualification for the work. There is here no expressed claim to inspiration, but at the same time no disclaimer of it.<h3><u>having traced down]</u></h3> by research, and so become accurately acquainted with. from the very first—i. e. as in ver. 5 ; as distinguished from those who only wrote of the official life of the Lord, or only fragments perhaps of that. in order, i. e, consecutively.

He traced the events in order as they happened: but he may have arranged them as other considerations led him. most excellent Theophilus, It is wholly unknown who this person was. The name was a very com- mon one. The conjectures about him are endless, and entirely without value. It appears by the title given him, that he was a person of dignity, and of course, from ver. 4, he was a convert to Christianity. The idea of the name being not a proper, but a feigned one, designating ‘those who loved God’ (found as early as Epiphanius, and adopted again recently), is far-fetched and improbable. 4.Theophilus had then been orally instructed in the narratives which form the subject of this Gospel : and St. Luke’s intention in writing it is, that he might have a more accurate know- ledge of these histories. The word means literally, catechized, ‘catechetically taught.’ those sayings, not as in A.

It appears, from the allot- ment having been just mentioned, to have been the morning incense burning. Theophylact and others understand the whole as describing the entry into the Holy of<br><br>holies on the great day of Atonement, Levit. xvi.

It was during the sacrifice on the great altar that the daily burning of the incense took place: one of the two priests, whose lot it was to offer incense, brought fire from off the altar of burnt-offering to the altar of incense, and then left the other priest there alone, who, on a signal from the priest presiding at the sacrifice, kindled the incense: see Exod. xl 5, 26.

But we must take the word in the narrower sense, not in the wider reference of Rom. ix. 8. Elisabeth was of <i>the tribe of Levi </i>: but this need not hinder connexion by marriage with other tribes. Aaron himself married into Judah, Exod. vi. 23. We find in Judges xvii. 7 a young man of the family of Judah who was a Levite. Philo says, “‘ Moses ordered the high priest to marry not only a virgin, but one of priestly descent... but the other priests were permitted to marry other than the daughters of priests.” <b>38.] </b>Her own faithful and humble assent is here given to the divine announcement which been made to her. I believe that her conception of the Lord is to be dated <i>from ‘the utterance of these words.</i> So Euthymius, and similarly Irensus, Tertullian, Athanasius, Maldonatus, Grotius. Light-foot, holding a different opinion, says,<i> “I own, that it is the general opinion, that the Virgin conceived at Nazareth, in the instant when the Angel spoke with her.”</i> She was no unconscious vessel of the divine<br><br>will, but (see ver. 45), in humility and faith, a fellow-worker with the purpose of the Father; and therefore <i><b>her own unity with that purpose was required,</b></i> and 1s here recorded. <h2><u><b>39—56.]</u></h2> VISITATION OF ELISABETH BY MARY 39.]</b> The situation of Elisabeth was not before this known to Mary; and on the intelligence of it from the angel, she arose and went to congratulate her kinswoman. But before this the events related in Matt. i. 18—25 had happened. <br><br>Mary -being betrothed to Joseph, had no communications with him, except through the bridesmaids; who, on the first indications of her pregnancy, represented it to him. This would not take longer time than the ex- pression might include—possibly three or four weeks. Then happened Matt. i. 19, 20; and immediately Joseph took her home. As a betrothed virgin she could not travel: but now immediately, and perhaps for the very reason of the circumstances under which Joseph had taken her home, she visits Elisabeth — remaining with her about three months, ver. 56. So that we have, five months, during which Elisabeth hid herself, together with the sixth month, during which takes place the Annunciation, the discovery of Mary’s pregnancy, her taking home by Joseph, together with three months visit of Mary, making up together nine months, nearly her full time: see ver. 57. The words rendered <b>a city of Juda may possibly mean </b><i><b>“</b><b>the city of Juttah,”</b></i> which (Josh. xxi. 16) was given, together with Hebron | (in the hill country of Judea : ib. ver. 11), and other neighbouring cities, to the children of Aaron the priest.

The movement of the babe in her womb (possibly for the first time) was part of the effect of the same spiritual influence. The <i>known</i> mysterious effects of sympathy in such cases, at least lead us to believe that there may be corresponding effects where the causes are of a kind <i>beyond our common experience</i>.<br><br><i>‘The salutation of Mary’ </i>might be taken to mean the Annunciation : better therefore as in margin, <b>Mary’s salutation.</b><h2><u><b>42.]</u></h2></b> The word rendered Blessed has a double meaning : that of blessed,—<i>from above</i>—blessed among women, i.e. <i>beyond </i>other women; and praised,—from below —i.e. called blessed by women. The former is the best rendering : and then women will be the Hebrew superlative, as in Jer. xlix. 15, and Song of Sol. i. 8.<h2><u><b>43.]</u></h2></b> The word <b>Lord</b>, as applied to the unborn babe, can no otherwise be explained than as uttered in the spirit of prophecy, and expressing <i>the divine nature </i>of our Lord: see especially Ps. cx. 1, from which Bleek thinks the expression is adopted. <h2><u><b>45.]</u></h2> </b>The words may be rendered either as in A. V. (so also the Vulgate Erasmus,Beza, Meyer), <b>blessed is she that believed</b>, <b>for, &c.—or as in margin of A. V., blessed is she that believed that there shall be.</b> The last is maintained by Bengel and De Wette, and supported by Acts xxvii. 25. I much prefer the former rendering, as agreeable likewise to the analogy of Scripture, <i>where faith, in the recipient</i> of the divine purposes, is so often represented as a coordinate cause of the fulfillment of those purposes. Light-foot well suggests, that there may have been present to the mind of Elisabeth the <i>unbelief</i> <i>of her husband</i>, as contrasted with Mary’s faith. <h2><u><b>46—55.]</u></h2></b> Compare throughout the song of Hannah, 1 Sam. ii. 1—10. As connected with the defense of the hymns contained in these two chapters, we may observe, <i>taking the very lowest ground</i>, that there is nothing improbable, as matter of fact, in holy persons, full of the thoughts which run through the O. T. prophecies, breaking out into such songs of praise as these, which are grounded on and almost expressed in the words of Scripture. The Christian believer however will take a <i>higher view than this</i>, and attribute to the mother of our Lord that same inspiration of the Holy Spirit which filled Elisabeth (ver. 41) and Zacharias (ver. 67). <h2><u><b>46.]</u></h2> My soul. . .

The dayspring does not come <i>from on high</i>, but from beneath the horizon ; but the Messiah does.

It is the expression of the aspirations and hopes of a pious Jew, waiting for the salvation of the Lord, finding that salvation brought near, and uttering his thankfulness in Old Testament language, with which he was familiar, and at the same time under prophetic influence of the Holy Spirit. <br><br>That such a song should. be <i><b>inconsistent</b></i> with dogmatic truth, is <i>impossible</i>: that it should unfold it minutely, is in the highest degree improbable, <h2><u><b>80.]</u></h2> </b>A very similar conclusion to those in ch. ii. 40, 62, and denoting probably the termination of that record or document of the birth of the Baptist, which the Evangelist has hitherto been translating, or perhaps transcribing already translated. <h3><u>That this first chapter is such a separate document, appears from its very distinct style.

Now <i>both of </i>these senses till recently seemed to be <i>inadmissible</i>. For Quirinus was not known to have been governor of Syria till the year of Rome 758, after the banishment of Archelaus, and the addition of his territory to the province of Syria. And the birth of our Lord occurred at least <i>eight years before this,</i> previous to Herod’s death, and when <i>Sentius Saturninus was governor of Syria</i>. But it has been made highly probable, by A. W. Zampt of Berlin, that Quirinus was TWICE governor of Syria. The substance of his researches is given at length in the note in my Greek Testament. The result of it is, that Zumpt fixes the time of his <i>first governorship</i> at from Bc. 4 to B.c.1. It is true this does not quite remove our difficulty. But it brings it within such narrow limits, that any slight error in calculation, or even the latitude allowed by the words was first made might well cover it. I may mention it as remarkable, that Justin Martyr (Century 2) three times distinctly asserts that our Lord was born under Quirinus, and appeals to the register then made, as if from it the fact might, if necessary, be confirmed.<br><br>We conclude then, that an assessment or enrolment of names with a view to ascertain the population of the empire, was commanded and put in force at this time, It was unaccompanied (probably) by any payment of money. We know that Augustus drew up an account or summary of <i>the whole empire</i>, which took many years to arrange and complete, and of which the enrolment of the inhabitants of the provinces would naturally form a part. the data for this compilation, the enrolment in our text might be one. <br><br>That Judwa <i>was not a Roman province at this time,  </i>is no objection to our text; for the compilation of Augustus contained the “<i>kingdoms</i>” of the Roman empire, as well as the provinces.<h2><u><b>3—5.]</u></h2> </b>There is a mixture here of Ro- man and Jewish customs, which is not at all improbable, considering the circumstances. In the Roman census, men, women, and children were all obliged to go and be enrolled. But then this census was made at their <i>dwelling-place</i>, not at that of their <i>extraction</i>. The latter practice springs from the Jewish genealogical habits, and its adoption in this case <i>speaks strongly for the accuracy of the chronology. </i>If this enrolment, was by order of Augustus, and for the whole empire, it of course would be made so as to include all, after the Roman manner: but inasmuch as it was made <i>under the Jewish king Herod,</i> it was done <i>after the Jewish manner,</i> in taking this account of each at his own place of extraction. <br><br>Mary being apparently herself sprung from the lineage of David (see ch. i. 32), might on this account go to Bethlehem, being, as some suppose, an inheritress; but this does not seem to be the Evangelist’s meaning, but that, after the Roman manner, she accompanied her husband. <br><br>No stress must be laid on espoused, as if she were <i>only</i> the <i>betrothed</i> wife of Joseph at this time;—she had been taken to his house before this: the history in our text happening during the time indicated by Matt. i. 25. <h2><u><b>7.]</u></h2></b> Now that <i><b>“first</b><b>-</b><b>born”</b></i> has disappeared: from the text of St. Matthew (i. 25), it must be here remarked, that although the term may undoubtedly be used of an only child, such use is necessarily always connected with the expectation of others to follow, and can<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 1, Part 1, Luke, Pages 370-432 missing.</h2><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UqtuYC_uEXhIHoXSIloWnELn7BwRRX3K/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

To deny altogether this allusion, is to rest contented with merely the surface of the parable.<br><br>Observe, Abraham does not say, ‘they will not <i>repent</i>’—but, ‘they will not <i>believe, be persuaded:</i>’ which is another and a deeper thing.<br><br>Luther does not seem to conclude rightly, that this <i>disproves</i> the possibility of appearances the dead. It only says, that such appearances will not bring about <i>faith</i> in the human soul: but that they may not serve other ends in God’s dealings with men, it does not assert. There is no gulf between the <i>earth</i> and Hadës: and the very form of Abraham’s answer, setting forth no impossibility in this second case, as in the former, would seem to imply its <i>possibility, </i>if requisite.<br><br>We can hardly pass over the identity of the <i>name</i> LAZARUS with that of him who <i>actually was recalled from the dead,</i> but whose return, far from persuading the Pharisees, was the immediate exciting cause of their crowning act of unbelief.<h1><u><b>CHAP.

THE ETERNAL WORD OF GOD, THE SOURCE OF ALL EXISTENCE, LIFE, AND LIGHT, BECAME FLESH, DWELT AMONG US, WAS WITNESSED TO BY JOHN, REJECTED BY HIS OWN PEOPLE, BUT RECEIVED BY SOME, WHO HAD POWER GIVEN THEM TO BECOME THE SONS OF GOD. HE WAS THE PERFECTION AND END OF GOD’s REVELATION OF HIMSELF; WHICH WAS PARTIALLY MADE IN THE LAW, BUT FULLY DECLARED IN JESUS CHRIST.<h2><u><b>1—5.]</u></h2> </b>THE ETERNAL PRE-EXISTENCE OF THE WORD: HIS PERSONAL DISTINCTNESS; BUT ESSENTIAL UNITY WITH GOD. His WORKING IN CREATION, AND IN THE ENLIGHTENING OF MEN, BEFORE HIS MANIFESTATION IN THE FLESH; HIS NON-APPREHENSION BY THEM.<h2><u><b>1.]</u></h2></b> Before commenting on the truths here declared, it is absolutely necessary to discuss the one term on which the whole turns: viz. THE WORD. This term is used by St. John <i>without explanation</i>, as bearing a meaning well known to his readers. The enquiry concerning that meaning must therefore be conducted on <i>historical</i>, not on mere <i>grammatical </i>grounds. And the most important elements of the enquiry are, (I.) <i>the usage of speech as regards the term</i>, by St. John himself and other biblical writers: and (II.) <i>the purely historical information </i>which we possess on the <i>ideas attached to the term</i>.<br><br>(<i>a</i>) From the first consideration we find, that in other biblical authors, as well as in John, the term LOGOS, which is the original word here, is never used to signify the divine <i>Reason </i>or <i>Mind</i>; nor indeed those of any human creature. These ideas are otherwise expressed. The usual Scripture meaning of <i>Logos is speech</i>, or <i>word</i>. The <i>logos </i>of God is the <i>creative, declarative,  injunctive Word of God</i>. <br><br>(<i>b</i>) That this is also the import in our prologue, is manifest, from the evident relation which it bears to the opening of the history of creation in Genesis. “The Word” is not an <i>attribute </i>of God, but an <i>acting reality</i>, by which the Eternal and Infinite is the great first cause of the created and finite.<br><br>(<i>c</i>) Again, this “Word” is undoubtedly in our prologue, <i>personal</i>: —not an abstraction merely, nor a personification,—not the speaking word of God, once manifested in the prophets and afterwards fully declared in Christ, as Luthardt, comparing our prologue with Heb.i.1,— but a PERSON: for “<i>the Word </i><b>was with God</b>,” and “<i>the Word </i><b>became flesh</b>:” also the Word <b>was God</b>, not <i>was God’s </i>:— which certainly would be said of none but a PERSON. <br><br>(<i>d</i>) Moreover, the WORD is <i>identical with </i>JESUS CHRIST, as the pre-existing Son of God. A comparison of verses 14 and 15 will place this beyond doubt. <br><br>(<i>e</i>) And Jesus Christ is the Word of God, not because He <i>speaks the word </i>;—nor because He is the One promised or spoken of,—nor because He is the Author and source of the Word as spoken in the Scriptures, &c.,—any more than his being called <b>life </b>and <b>light </b>implies only that He is the <i>Giver </i>of life and light: but because <i>the Word dwells in and speaks from him</i>, just as the Light dwells in and shines from, and the Life<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oQUoh0iK4abo-ErkyLOa6XKt7ePDdfzh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It was He who made the worlds (ver. 3) ; He, who appeared to Isaiah (Isa. vi. compare ch.xii.41); He, whose glory is manifested in His power over nature (ch.ii.11); He, by reception of whom the new birth is wrought (ch.i.12, 13); who has power over all flesh (ch. xvii. 2),—and can bestow eternal life (ibid.) ; whose very sufferings were His glory, and the glorifying of God (ch. xvii. 1 al.) ; and who, after those sufferings, resumed, and now has, the glory which He had with the Father before the world began (ch. xviii. 5, 24).<br><br>(<i>h</i>) Luthardt, in his Commentary on this Gospel, has propounded the following view of the term “Word” and its usage: “Jesus Christ is the fulness of that word of God which was fragmentarily manifested in the prophets (Heb. i. 1). But in this prologue, ‘the Word’ is not to be taken <i>as identical with </i>Jesus not yet incarnate, nor is He the subject of vv. 1 ff.” And he urges ch. x. 35, 36 (see note there, where I have discussed this) as a key text to the meaning of “the Word.”<br><br>It seems to me, that while much of his view is true and sound, that part of it will not hold which denies the identity of the pre-existent “Word” with Jesus, in the Apostle’s mind. Had he intended by the “Word” of vv. 1–4 any other than the personal Son of God, who in ver. 14 became flesh, I do not see how “<i>was with God</i>,” and “<i>was God</i>,” could be used of “the Word.” <br><br>Nor again can I consent with him to disconnect the use of “Logos” by St.John from its previous history. The reasons given in this note for believing such use, as matter of fact, to have been prepared by the Alexandrine philosophy, are no way affected by the objections which he alleges, the difference between the “ Logos” of St. John and that of Philo, and the corrupt character of the philosophy itself. <br><br>II. (<i>a</i>) We are now secondly to enquire, how it came that St. John found this term “Logos” <i>so ready made to his hands, as to require no explanation</i>. The answer to this will be found by tracing the <i>gradual personification </i>of the <i>Word</i>, or <i>Wisdom of God</i>, in the O.T. and Jewish writings.<br><br>(<i>b</i>) We find faint traces of this personification in the <i>book of Psalms</i>: see Ps. xxxiii. 4, 6; cxix. 89, 105; cvii. 20; cxlvii. 15, 18. But it was not the mere offspring of poetic diction. For the whole form and expression of the O.T. revelation was that of the <i>Word of God</i>. The Mosaic History opens with ‘<i>God said</i>, Let there be light.’ <i>Spoken</i> commands, either openly, or in visions, were the communications from God to man. It is the Word, in all the Prophets ; the Word, in the Law ; in short, the Word, in all God’s dealings with his people: see further, Isa. xl. 8; lv. 10, 11: Jer. xxiii. 29 al.<br><br>(<i>c</i>) And as the <i>Word </i>of God was the constant idea for His revelations <i>relatively to man</i>, so was the <i>Wisdom </i>of God, for those which related to His own <i>essence and attributes</i>. That this was a later form of expression than the simple recognition of the divine Word in the Mosaic and early historical books, would naturally be the case, in the unfolding of spiritual knowledge and divine contemplation. His Almightiness was first felt, before His Wisdom and moral Purity were appreciated. In the books of Job (ch. xxviii. 12 ff.) and the Proverbs (ch. viii. ix.) we find this <i>Wisdom of God </i>personified; in the latter in very plain and striking terms; and this not poetically only, but practically ; ascribing to the <i>Wisdom of God </i>all his revelation of Himself in His works of Creation and Providence. So that this <i>Wisdom </i>embraced in fact in itself the <i>Power </i>of God; and there wanted but the highest divine attribute, <i>Love</i>, to complete the idea. But this was reserved for the N.T. manifestation.<br><br>(<i>d</i>) The next evidences of the gradual personification of the <i>Wisdom of God </i>are found in the two Apocryphal Books, the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach, and the Wisdom of Solomon. The first of these, <i>originally written in Hebrew</i>, belongs probably to the latter half of the second century before Christ. In ch. i. 1, Wisdom is said to be “<i>from the Lord; and with Him for ever</i>:?” and in ver. 4, “ <i>Wisdom hath been created before all things</i>.” Then in ch. xxiv. 9— 21, the same strain is continued; “He created me from the beginning before the world,” &c., and the passage concludes with these remarkable words, “<i>They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f4HG7NEa7TISl3KAHex2-kCp6FrpsSBB/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 2, Page 65:</a></h3><br><i>drink me shall yet be thirsty</i>.” <br><br>In the book of the Wisdom of Solomon, dating probably about 100 before Christ, we find (in ch. vi.22—ch. ix.) a similar personification and eulogy of Wisdom. In this remarkable passage we have “ <i>Wisdom, that sitteth by Thy throne</i>” (ch. ix.4)—said to have been “<i>present when Thou madest the world</i>” (ch.ix.9)—parallelized with “<i>Thy word</i>” (ch.ix.1,2: see also ch. xvi. 12), In ch. xviii. 15, 16, the “<i>Almighty Word</i>” is set forth as an Angel coming down from heaven, and destroying the Egyptians. <br><br>It seems highly probable that the author’s monotheistic views were confused by the admixture of Platonism, and that he regarded Wisdom as a kind of soul of the world. He occasionally puts her for God, occasionally for an attribute of God. But he had not attained that near approach to a <i>personal </i>view which we shall find in the next step of our enquiry. (<i>e</i>) The large body of Jews resident in Alexandria were celebrated for their <i>gnosis</i>, or religious philosophy. The origin of this philosophy must be referred to the mixture of the Jewish religious element with the speculative philosophies of the Greeks, more especially with that of Plato, and with ideas acquired during the captivity from Oriental sources. One of these Alexandrine writers in the second century A.C. was Aristobulus, some fragments of whose works have been preserved to us. He tells us that by the “<i>voice of God</i>” we are not to understand a “<i>spoken word</i>,” but the whole working of God in the creation of the world. <br><br>But the most complete representation of the Judeo- alexandrine gnosis, or philosophic theology, has come down to us in the works of Philo, who flourished cir. A.D.40–50. It would be out of the province of a note to give a review of the system of Philo: the result only of such review will be enough. He identifies the “<i>word</i>” with the “wisdom” of God ; it is the “<i>image of God </i>;” the “<i>archetype and pattern of light, but itself like none of created things :” “the eldest of begotten things :” “the eldest son of the Father of all that are :” “ His first-begotten, the eldest angel, being as an archangel with many names</i>” (i. 427): “<i>the shadow of God, using whom as an instrument He made the world </i>:” “<i>through whom the world was constituted </i>:” “ <i>The Father which begat all gave to the Arch-angel and the eldest born, the Word, the eminent prerogative, that, standing between, he might divide the made from the Maker; ...and He (the Word) rejoices in the prerogative.... not being unbegotten, as God, nor begotten, as we, but intermediate between the extremes, acting as a hostage to both:” “ there are, as it seems, two temples of God; one, this world, in which also His first-begotten divine Word is High Priest :” “the viceroy of God:” “he contains and hath fulfilled all things :” “the second God, which is His Word.” </i>These instances, the number of which might be much enlarged, will serve to shew how remarkably near to the diction and import of some passages in our Gospel Philo approached in speaking of the Word. <br><br>At the same time there is a <i>wide and unmistakable difference </i>between his “Word” and that of the Apostle. He does not distinguish it from the <i>Spirit of God</i>, nor does he connect it with any Messianic ideas, though these latter were familiar to him. Besides, his views are strangely compounded of Platonism and Judaism. The “Word” seems with him to be one comprehending, or ruling, the “ powers” or “ideas” of God, which, although borrowed from Plato, he Judaically calls “<i>angels</i>,” and the “Word” their “<i>archangel</i>.” We see by this however how fixed and prepared <i>the term</i>, and many of its attributes, were in the religious philosophy of the Alexandrine Jews. <br><br>(<i>f</i>) Meanwhile the Chaldee paraphrasts of the O.T. had habitually used such expressions as ‘the glory,’ or ‘the presence,’ or ‘the word,’ of God,—in places where nothing but His own agency could be understood. ‘The latter of these —the Memra, or word of God,—is used in so strictly personal a sense, that there can be little doubt that the Paraphrasts understood by it a divine Person or Emanation. <br><br>(<i>g</i>) From these elements, the Alexandrine and Jewish views of the “Word” or “ Wisdom” of God, there appear to have arisen very early among Christians, both orthodox and heretic, formal expressions, in which these or equivalent terms were used. Of this the Apostle Paul furnishes the most eminent example. His teacher Gamaliel united in his instruction both these elements, and they are very perceptible in the writings of his pupil. But <i>we do not find in them any direct use of the term </i>“ WORD,” as <i>personally applied to the Son of God</i>. This. shews him to have spoken mainly according to the Jewish school,—among whom, as Origen states, he could find none who held “<i>that the WORD was the Son of </i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBzMVDVT7q-GD1iiwdVim6tsNh861xlm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But even there <i>we have not the </i>“Logos” <i>identified personally with the Lord Jesus Christ</i>, or indeed <i>personally spoken so at all</i>, —however near some passages may seem to approach to this usage (ch.iv. 12, 13; xi.3). <br><br>(<i>i</i>) The Alexandrine gnosis was immediately connected with Ephesus, where the Gospel of John was probably written. Apollos (Acts xviii. 24) came thither <i>from Alexandria</i>; and Cerinthus is related by Theodoret to have studied and formed his philosophic system in Egypt, before coming to Ephesus. <br><br>(<i>j</i>) These notices will serve to account for the term “Logos” being already found by St. John framed to his use; and the anti-Gnostic tendency of his writings will furnish an additional reason why he should rescue such important truths as the pre-existence and attributes of the divine “Word” from the perversions which false philosophy had begun to make of them. <br><br>(<i>k</i>) In all that has been said in this note, no insinuation has been conveyed that either the Apostle Paul, or the Writer to the Hebrews, or John, <i>adopted in any degree their TEACHING from the existing philosophies</i>. Their teaching (which is totally distinct from any of those philosophies, as will be shewn in this commentary) is that of the Holy Spirit;—and the existing philosophics, with all their follies and inadequacies, must be regarded, <i>in so far as they </i>by their terms or ideas subserved the work which the Spirit had to do by the Apostles and teachers of Christianity, as so many providential preparations of the minds of men to receive the fuller effulgence of the Truth as it is in Jesus, which shines forth in these Scriptures.<h3><u><b>In the beginning]</u></h3> </b>Equivalent to “<i>before the world was</i>,” ch. xvii. 5. The expression is indefinite, and must be interpreted relatively to the matter spoken of. ‘Thus in Acts xi. 15, it is “the beginning of the Gospel:” and by the same principle of interpretation, <i>here </i>it is <b>the beginning of all things</b>, on account of “<i>all things were made by him</i>” ver. 3. <br><br>These words, if they do not <i>assert</i>, at least <i>imply</i>, the <i>eternal pre-existence </i>of the divine Word. For “<i>was in the beginning </i>is not said of an <i>act done </i>in the beginning (as in Gen. i. 1), but of a <i>state existing </i>in the beginning, and therefore without beginning itself. <br><br><b>was</b>, not equivalent to “<i>is</i>” (see “<i>I am</i>,” ch. viii. 58 al.), as Euthymius and others have supposed ; but Origen has given the true reason for the indefinite past being used,— “It would have been more strict, in speaking of God the Word, to say <b>is</b>; but seeing that he is speaking with reference to the distinction of the Incarnation, which took place at a certain time, the Evangelist uses <b>was </b>instead of <b>is</b>.” The existence of an enduring and unlimited state of being, implied in “<i>was</i>,” is contrasted with “<i>was made</i>,” or “<i>became</i>” (the word is the same) in verses 3 and 14.<h3><u><b>and the Word was with God]</u></h3> ‘With</b> is here used in the sense of “chez,” abiding with. Basil remarks that St. John says “<i>with</i> God, not <i>in </i>God, that he may set before us the distinctness of Person: . . . that he may give no opening for the confusion of person.” Both the inner substantial union, and the distinct personality of the “ Word ” are here asserted. The former is distinctly repeated in the next words. <h3><u><b>and the Word was God]</u></h3> </b>This is the true form of the sentence; not ‘<i>God was the Word</i>.’ This is absolutely required by the usage of the Greek language: see in my Gr. Test. But the <i>sense </i>to be conveyed here is as weighty a consideration as the form of the sentence. Had St. John intended to say, ‘ <i>God was the Word</i>,’ —what meaning could his assertion possibly have conveyed? None other than a contradiction to his last assertion, by which he had distinguished God from the Word. And not only would this be the case, but the assertion would be inconsistent with the whole historical idea of the Word, making: this term to signify merely an attribute of God, just as when it is said, “ <i>God is love</i>.” Not to mention the unprecedented inversion of subject and predicate which this would occasion; “<i>the Word</i>” <i>having been the subject before</i>, and again <i>resumed as the subject afterwards</i>. <br><br>The <i>rendering </i>of the words being then as above, their <i>meaning </i>is the next question. <b>God</b> (see the grammatical reasons in my Gr. Test.) must be taken as implying God <i>in substance and essence</i>,—not ‘the Father,’ <i>in Person</i>. It does not mean “ <i>divine</i>,” nor is it to be rendered “<i>a God </i>”—but, as in “<i>became flesh</i>,” “<i>flesh</i>” expresses that <i>state </i>into which the Divine Word entered<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj-a-92yKPmpYs75tXtde34fa894h8Gh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

So that this first verse might be connected thus: the Word was from eternity, —was with God (the Father), —and was Himself God. <h2><u><b>2.]</u></h2> </b>In order to direct the mind to the difference (in unity) between this “Word” and “God,” St. John recalls the reader’s attention to the two first clauses of ver. 1, which he now combines, in order to pass on to the <i>creative work</i>, which distinctly belongs to the “Word.” Thus also this verse fixes the reference of him in ver. 3, which might otherwise, after the mention of “God,” have seemed ambiguous. <b> </b> <b>3.] All things </b>(1 Cor. viii. 6. Col. i. 16), equivalent to “<i>the world</i>,” ver. 10. This parallelism of itself refutes the Socinian interpretation of “<i>all things</i>,” “all Christian graces and virtues, ‘the whole moral world.’ But the history of the term “ Logos” forbids such an explanation entirely. For Philo says, “<i>Thou shalt find that the cause of the world is God, by whom it was made; the matter, the four elements, out of which it was composed</i>: <b>the instrument, the Word of God, through whom it was constituted:” </b>see also Col. i. 16, and Heb. i. 2. Olshausen observes, that we never read in Scripture that ‘Christ made the world;’ but ‘the Father made the world <i>through </i>the Son,’ or ‘the world was made <i>by </i>the Father, and <i>through </i>the Son:’ because the Son <i>never works of Himself</i>, but always <i>as the revelation of the Father </i>; His work is the Father’s <i>will</i>, and the Father has no Will, except the Son, who is <i>all His will </i>(in whom He is well pleased). The Christian Fathers rightly therefore rejected the semi- Arian formula, ‘The Son was begotten by an act of the Father’s will;’ for He is <i>that Will Himself</i>. <h3><u><b>and without him]</u></h3> </b>This addition is not merely a Hebraistic parallelism, but a distinct denial of the eternity and uncreatedness of matter as held by the Gnostics. They set <i>matter</i>, as a separate existence, over against God, and made it the origin of evil:—but St. John excludes any such notion. Nothing was mado without Him (the Word); all matter, and <i>implicitly </i>evil itself, in the deep and inscrutable purposes of creation (for it was not in the beginning, but was made), <b>was made through Him. </b><br><br>The punctuation at the end of the verse is uncertain, if we regard solely manuscript authority. Some of our MSS. set a full stop at “<i>was not any thing made</i>:” so that the sense of the words following would be, “<i>That which hath been made by (or in) him was life</i>.’ The question must however be determined by the sense of the passage, which is rendered weak, and inconsistent with analogy, by adopting this punctuation :—<i>weak</i>, because in that case we must render ‘That which hath been made by Him was life (i. e. having life), and that life was the light of men ;’ but. <i>how </i>was that life, i. e. that living creation which was made by Him, the light of men ? —<i>inconsistent with analogy</i>, for St. John’s usage of beginning a sentence with “<i>in</i>” or “<i>by</i>” and a demonstrative pron. should have its weight : compare ch. xiii. 35; xv. 8; xvi. 26: 1 John ii. 3, 4, 5; iii. (8,) 10, 16, 19, 24; iv.2 al. fr. Compare also 1 John ii. 4,—ib. iii. 5. I have determined therefore for the ordinary punctuation. It is said to have been first adopted owing to an abuse of the passage by the Macedonian heretics, who maintained that if the exclusion (“<i>without him was not any thing made that was made</i>”) was <i>complete</i>, the Holy Spirit can also not have been without His creating power, i. e. was created by Him. But this would be refuted otherwise, for the Holy Spirit “<i>was</i>,” and “<i>was not made</i>.” <h2><u><b>4.]</u></h2> In him was life</b>—compare 1 John v. 11, i. 1, 2, and ch, vi. 33. <br><br><b>life </b>is not merely ‘<i>spiritual life</i>,’ nor ‘<i>the recovery of blessedness</i>,’ —as some explain it:—the Word is the source of <i>all life </i>to the creature, not indeed ultimately, but mediately (see ch. v. 26: 1 John vy. 11). <h3><u><b>and the life was the light of men]</u></h3> </b>This is not to be understood of the <i>teaching of the Incarnate Word</i>, but of the <i>enlightening and life-sustaining influence of the eternal Son of God</i>, in Whom was life. In the material world, light, the offspring of the Word of God, is the condition of life, and without it life degenerates and expires:—so also in the spiritual world that <i>life </i>which is in Him, is to the creature the very condition of all development and furtherance of the life of the spirit. All knowledge, all purity, all love, all happiness, spring up and grow from this life, which is the light to them all. <br><br>It is not “<i>light</i>,” but <i>the light </i>:—because this is <i>the only </i>true light: see ver. 9, also 1 John i. 5.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ZvhKsDIoy9S4EODtTfb_KRwoGhWf6NZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The whole world, lying in death and in darkness, is the <b>darkness </b>here spoken of :—not merely the “<i>darkened</i>” (Eph. iv. 18; see Eph. v. 7, 8), but the <i>whole mass</i>, with the sole exception (see below, ver. 12) of “<i>as many as received Him</i>” (compare ch. iii. 19; 1 John v. 19). <br><br>This <b>shineth </b>not merely the historical present, but describes the whole process of the light of life in the Eternal Word shining in this evil and dark world; both by the O. T. revelations, and (see ch. x. 16; xi. 52) by all the scattered fragments of light glittering among the thick darkness of heathendom.<h3><u><b>and the darkness comprehended </b>(understood, apprehended) <b>it not</b>]</u></h3> That this is the meaning, will be clear from the context. St. John states here as <i>a general fact</i>, what he afterwards states of the appearance of the Incarnate Word to the chosen people, ver. 11. The sentences are strictly parallel. “<i>The light shineth in the darkness</i>” is parallel to “ <i>He came to his own</i>,” and “ <i>the darkness comprehended it not</i>” is parallel to “ <i>His own received him not</i>.” In the first, he is speaking of the <i>whole shining of this light over the world </i>; in the second, of its <i>historical manifestation to the Jews</i>. In both cases, <i>the Divine Word was rejected</i>.<br><br><b>received </b>is used in the second case as expressing the personal assumption to oneself. as a friend or companion. <br><br>Lücke observes, that the almost tragic tone of this verse is prevalent through the Gospel of St. John and his first epistle, see ch. iii. 19; xii. 37 ff. al. : and is occasionally found in St. Paul also; see Rom. i. 18 ff.<br><br>The connexion of the two members of our verse by and is not, “The Light shineth in the darkness, <i>and therefore </i>(i.e. because darkness is the opposition to light, and they exclude one another) the darkness comprehended it not;” but, “The Light shineth in the darkness, <i>and yet </i>(notwithstanding that the effect of light in darkness is so great and immediate in the physical world) the darkness comprehended it not :” see “<i>and</i>” below, ver. 11.<h2><u><b>6—18.]</u></h2> THE MANIFESTATION AND WORKING OF THE DIVINE WORD, JESUS  CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD, INCARNATE IN OUR FLESH. </b><h2><u><b>6.]</u></h2></b> The Evangelist now passes to the <i>historic manifestation </i>of the Word. “In passing to the manifestation of the Son, what other beginning should he have fixed on, but the matters concerning John?” Theodore of Mopsuestia.

We must not render, as A. V., ‘<i>for a witness</i>, but <b>for witness </b>or <b>for testimony</b>, for the purpose of bearing witness. <br><br><b>to bear witness </b>&c. is an expansion of <b>for witness </b>:—the subject of his testimony was to be, <b>—the Light</b>,—and the aim of it, <b>—that all might believe </b>(see ch. xii. 36) <b>through </b><i>him </i>(i.e. John: not. through <i>it, the light</i>, which confuses the whole, for then we must understand <b>on God </b>after <b>believe</b>, which is here out of place) <h2><u><b>8.]</u></h2> </b>John was himself “<i>the candle, lighted and shining</i>” (ch. v. 35), see note on Matt. v. 14, but not <b>the light</b>.<h2><u><b>9.]</u></h2> </b>The word <b>true </b>in this connexion imports original, ‘archetypal,’ and is used of the true genuine sources and patterns of those things which we find here below only in fragmentary imitations and derivations.

V.), or does it belong to <b>the true light</b>? <br><br>The former construction can only be defended by a Rabbinical usage, by which “<i>all that cometh into the world</i>” means ‘all men.’ But it is very questionable whether St. John ever speaks thus. Certainly he does not, in any of the passages commonly cited to defend this rendering, ch. xviii. 87 (which is spoken by Christ of Himself and His Mission); xvi. 21, 28; xii. 46. And even if he had thus spoken, how harsh and how unmeaning is the sentence, however we take it ; whether with Euthymius we lay an emphasis on “was,” or with A.V. &c. supply “<i>that</i>” before it. If this latter had been intended, surely it would have been more distinctly expressed; and even when it is supplied, we have in this verse only a less forcible repetition of ver. 4. <br><br>It seems then that we must join <b>coming into the world </b>with <b>the true light</b>. <br><br>But even then, three ways of rendering are apparently open to us.<br><br>The first of these, which is that of Socinus, takes “<i>coming into the world</i>” as meaning, ‘<i>at its coming into the world</i>?’ This however—besides the sense being inconsistent with ver. 4—leaves the opening clause without a demonstrative pronoun, as before. Then, secondly, <b>coming </b>might seem to be used in the sense in which we frequently have it, as a sort of future, ‘who was, or is, to come;’ see Matt. xi. 3; Mark x. 30 al. fr.; ch. vi. 14; xi. 27, in which last two places it is joined, as here, with “<i>into the world</i>.” But if this be adopted, the only sense will be that the true light, &c. <i>was to come</i>; i.e. <i>had not yet come</i>; which manifestly is not correct; —for it <i>had come</i>, when John gave his witness ; and the whole of these verses 6—13 relate to the time when He had appeared, and <i>come </i>to His own. <br><br>We are driven then to the only legitimate rendering, which is to take <b>was coming </b>as equivalent to an imperfect, <b>came</b>:—this usage being frequent in the N. T. :—i.e. at the time when John bore this witness, the true light which lighteth every man, came—was in process of manifesting Himself, —into the world. <br><br><b>which lighteth every man </b>is a further expansion of <b>the true. </b><h2><u><b>10.]</u></h2> The world </b>is the created world, into which He came (ver. 9), which was made by Him (ver. 3), which nevertheless (i e. as here represented by <i>man</i>, the only creature who “<i>knows</i>”) knew, recognized Him not. <br><br><b>and </b>is as in ver. 5. The three members of the sentence form a climax; <b>—He was in the world </b>(and therefore the world should have known Him), <b>and the world was made by Him </b>(much more then should it have known Him), <b>and the world knew Him not</b>. <h2><u><b>11.]</u></h2> </b>It is impossible to express this verse in terse and short English. In the original, the first <b>his own </b>is neuter—<i>his own things</i>, or <i>possessions</i>: the second, masculine, <i>his own people</i>. If we enquire for the sense, <b>his own things </b>here cannot well mean <i>the world</i>, or <b>his own people </b>mankind in general: it would be difficult to point out any Scripture usage to justify such a meaning. But abundance of passages bear out the meaning which makes the former His own inheritance or possession, i.e. Judea; and the latter, the Jews; compare especially the parable Matt. xxi. 33 ff. ; and Ecclus. xxiv. 7 ff. And thus <b>came </b>forms a nearer step in the approach to the declaration in ver. 14. He <i>came </i>to His own.<h2><u>On <b>received him not </b>see above on ver. 5. <b>12.]</u></h2> </b>The words, <b>as many as... </b>. primarily refer to the “<i>election</i>” <i>among the Jews</i>, who have just been spoken of: but also, by implication, being opposed to both <b>the world </b>and <b>his own</b>, the <i>election </i>in all the world. <br><br><b>as many as received him</b>, i.e, as many as recognized Him as that which He was—the Word of God and Light of men. <h3><u><b>them gave he power]</u></h3> </b>The word means, not merely <i>capability</i>, —still less <i>privilege or prerogative,</i>—but <b>power </b>; involving all the actions and states needful to their so becoming, and removing all the obstacles in their way (e.g. the wrath of God, and the guilt of sin).<h3><u><b>to become children of God]</u></h3> </b>The spiritual life owes its beginning to <i>a birth from above</i>, ch. iii. 3—7. “And this birth is owing to the Holy Spirit of God; so that this is equivalent to saying, ‘As many as received Him, to them gave He His Holy Spirit.’ And we find that it was so: see Acts x. 44, <br><br><b>children </b><i>of God </i>is a more comprehensive expression than “<i>sons of </i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ft2IVeqYUKu__Tr2VwMpJb6Su3dLpK2a/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

V. is entirely without authority), which brings out rather our <i>adoption</i>, and hope of inheritance (Rom. viii. 14 ff.), whereas the other involves the <i>whole generation and process </i>of our life in the Spirit, as being from and of God, and consequently our <i>likeness </i>to God, walking in light as He is in light (1 John i. 5—7)—free from sin (ib. iii. 9; v.18) and death (ch. viii. 51). <h3><u><b>to them that believe on his name]</u></h3> His name </b>is <i>His manifestation as that which He has given Himself out to be: i.e. as a Saviour from sin;</i> see Matt. i. 21, “<i>Thou shalt call his name Jesus; for He himself shall save His people from their sins</i>.” <h2><u><b>13.]</u></h2> </b>The Jews grounded their claim to be children of God on their descent from Abraham. St. John here negatives any such claim, and asserts the exclusive divine birth of all who become children of God by faith. It is to be noticed that the conjunctions here are not merely disjunctive ones, which would necessitate the ranging the clauses as co-ordinate and parallel, but exclusive ones, which rise in climax from one clause to another,— ‘<i>not </i>of blood, <i>nor yet </i>of the will of the flesh, <i>nor yet </i>of the will of man, <i>but </i>of God.’ -Many Interpreters have seen in “<i>the will of man</i>” (the word in the original is that expressing the <i>man </i>as distinguished from the <i>woman</i>) the male, and in “<i>the will of the flesh</i>” the female side of human concupiscence (so Augustine, Theophylact, &c.) ; or in the former the higher and more conscious, in the latter the lower and animal side (Bleek, Luthardt). But both these interpretations seem to be objectionable.<h2><u><b>14.]</u></h2> And </b>must not be understood as giving a reason for the verse before; it is only the same copula as in vv. 1,3,4,5; sing on to a further assertion regarding the Word. <h3><u><b>became flesh]</u></h3> </b>the most general expression of the great truth that He became <i>man</i>. He became that, of which man is in the body compounded. ‘There is no <i>reference </i>here to the doctrine of the Lord Jesus being the second Adam, as Olshausen thinks ; but although there may be <i>no reference </i>to it, it <i>lies at the ground </i>of this wideness of expression. The doctrine in this form may have been, as Lücke observes, alien to St. John’s habits of thought, but not <i>that which is implied in the doctrine</i>, the taking of the <i>nature of man </i>by the Eternal Word. <h2><u>The simplicity of this expression is no doubt directed against’ the Docete of the Apostle’s time, who maintained that the Word only apparently took human nature. Therefore he says, absolutely and literally <b>became </b>flesh: —see 1 John iv. 2. The word rendered “<i>dwelt</i>,” properly is <i>‘sojourned</i>,’ or <b>‘tabernacled,’ </b>in us. There is no reference to the flesh being the <i>tabernacle </i>of the Spirit ;—but the word is one technically used in Scripture to import the <i>dwelling of God among men</i>. <b>us]</u></h2> </b>“men, who are flesh,” Bengel. <h3><u><b>we beheld]</u></h3> </b>See 1 John i. 1; 2 Pet. i. 16. This is the Apostle’s testimony as such, see Acts i. 21.<br><br>The mention of <b>glory </b>seems to be suggested by the word <b>tabernacled</b>, so frequently used of the divine Presence or <i>Shechinah</i>, and cognate in its very form with it. <br><br>This glory was seen by the disciples, ch. ii, 11; xi. 4: also by Peter, James, and John, specially, on the mount of transfiguration : to which occasion the words “<i>as of the only-begotten from the Father</i>” seem to refer: but mainly, in the whole converse and teaching and suffering of the Lord, who was full of grace and truth, see below. On the term <b>as</b>, Chrysostom remarks that ‘it is not a word of mere likeness, or comparison, but of confirmation, and unquestionable endowment: as if he had said, We saw glory such as became, and such as was likely would be possessed by, the only begotten and genuine Son of God the King of all.” <h3><u><b>only-begotten]</u></h3> </b>This word applied to Christ is peculiar to John, and occurs in ver. 18; ch. 16,18; 1 John iv. 9 only. In the N. T. usage it signifies the <i>only </i>son :—in the LXX, Ps. xxii. (xxi. 21 of the LXX) 20 (Heb., <i>my only one from the hand of the dog</i>), the <i>beloved</i>.

But obviously in the midst of ideas reaching so far deeper than that of regard, or love, of the Father for the Son, the word cannot be interpreted except in accordance with them. It refers to, and contrasts with, the children of God in vv. 12,13. <i>They </i>receive their divine birth by faith in Him, and through Him; but HE is the Only-begotten of the Father in the higher sense, in which He is begotten the Son of God.<br><br>The words <b>full of grace and truth </b>(see the note in my Gr.

V. <h3><u><b>grace and truth]</u></h3> </b>not equivalent to “<i>true grace</i>,” which destroys the precision of the expression, and itself conveys no sense whatever ; but <i>setting out the two sides </i>of the divine manifestation in Christ, <b>—grace</b>, as the result of Love to mankind, <b>—truth </b>(see ch. xiv. 6), as the unity, purity, and light of His own Character. <h2><u><b>15.]</u></h2> </b>The testimony of John, so important as being the fulfilment of the very object for which he was <i>sent from God</i>, is in this prologue ranged, so to speak, parallel with the assertions and testimony of the Evangelist himself. So that this verse does not interrupt the train of thought, but confirms by this important testimony the assertion “<i>the Word became flesh</i>,” shewing that John <i>bore witness to His pre-existence</i>. Then (ver. 16) the “<i>full of grace and truth</i>” is again taken up. Euthymius paraphrases: “Even if I,” says the Evangelist, “may perhaps seem to some not worthy of credit, yet before me John witnesseth to His Godhead, that John, whose name is great and celebrated among all the Jews.” <br><br><b>beareth witness</b>, <i>present</i>, for solemnity—as part of the testimony to Him, not only once given, but still sub- sisting. <br><br><b>crieth </b>(in the original, <i>perfect</i>, being, in sense, <i>present</i>, <i>‘hath cried,’ </i>so that the voice is still sounding), see ch. vii. 37: “John crieth out with confidence and joy, as becometh a great herald.” Bengel. <h3><u><b>This was he of whom I spake . . .</b>]</u></h3> This reference to a former saying seems to shew,as indeed would appear from the announcement of his own office by the Baptist, that he had uttered these words in the power of the Spirit concerning Him whose forerunner he was <i>before he saw and recognized Him in the flesh. </i>Then, <i>on doing so</i>, he exclaimed, <b>This was He of whom I spake</b>, &c. This view seems to be borne out. by his own statement, ver. 33, and by the order of the narrative in Matt. iii. 11, 12, 13. <h3><u><b>cometh after me]</u></h3> </b>In point of <i>time</i>; not of <i>birth</i>, merely or principally, nor of <i>commencement of official life</i>: but, inasmuch as John was His <i>Forerunner</i>, on account of official <i>position</i>.<h3><u><b>taketh place before me]</u></h3> </b>This expression, <b>taketh place</b>, represents one, in the original, very difficult to render in English. It is the same word as that rendered <i>“hath been made” </i>in ver. 8: <i>hath come to be, is constituted. </i>The A.V., <i>“is preferred,” </i>would be very suitable, setting forth the advancement to official dignity before which John’s office waned and decreased (ch. iii. 30), which took place even while John’s course was being fulfilled: but the objection to <i>‘preferred’ </i>is, its possible ambiguity: the word to <i>prefer </i>meaning to <i>esteem more highly</i>, as well as to <i>advance or promote</i>, which is the sense required here. Even Dr. Johnson has fallen into the mistake of quoting this very passage, in his Dictionary, as an instance of the sense “to love more than another.”<br><br><b>because </b>(or, <b>for</b>, but better because) <b>He </b><i>was </i>(not <i>“became” </i>or <i>“was made,” </i>but as in ver. 1) before me; i.e. ‘He <i>existed</i>, was in being, before me.’ The question raised by some, whether it is probable that the Baptist had, or expressed such views of the pre-existence of Christ, is not one for us to deal with, in the face of so direct a testimony as is given to the <i>fact</i>, here and in ch. iii, 27 ff. In all probability, the Evangelist was himself a disciple of the Baptist: and if he has given us, as compared with the other Evangelists, a fuller and somewhat differing account of his testimony to Christ, it is because his means of information were ampler than those of the other Evangelists. The questioners seem to forget that the Baptist was divinely raised up and commissioned, <i>and full of the Holy Ghost, and spoke in that power; </i>his declarations were not therefore merely conclusions<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZyvUxQ08KtBKfAw-fP0-n14AeOHF7SgX/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But it can hardly be that his testimony extends beyond ver. 15, for <b>all we </b>(in ver. 16) would bear no very definite meaning in his mouth, and the assertions in ver. 17 are alien from the character of the Baptist, belonging as they do to the more mature development of Christian doctrines. I cannot doubt that this and the following verses <i>belong to the Evangelist</i>, and are a carrying onwards of his declarations concerning the divine Word. <br><br>Ver. 15 is not parenthetical, but confirmatory of ver. 14, and this verse <i>grounds itself on the fact of ver. 14, corroborated by the testimony of ver. 15,— that He dwelt among us, and that we saw His glory, full of grace and truth. </i> <b>his fulness </b>is <i>that of which He was </i><b>full</b>, ver. 14, <h3><u><b>all we]</u></h3> </b>All who believe on Him; see ver. 12. <h3><u><b>received, and . . .]</u></h3> </b>‘Our relation to Him has been that of récipients out of His fulness, and the thing received has been’... .<h3><u><b>grace for grace]</u></h3> </b>The ancient interpretation, <i>the New Covenant instead of the Old </i>(Euthymius), is certainly wrong, for the <b>received </b>is spoken entirely of <i>the times of the Incarnate Word : </i>and besides, <i>the law </i>and <i>grace </i>are distinctly <i>opposed </i>to one another in the next verse. <br><br>The preposition rendered <b>for </b>(<i>instead of</i>) is properly used of any thing which <i>supersedes </i>another, or occupies its place. This is in fact its ordinary usage when <i>exchange </i>is spoken of: the possession of the thing gotten succeeds to, supersedes, the possession of the thing given in exchange, and I possess one thing <i>instead of </i>(or, <i>for</i>) another. ‘Thus also we have received <b>grace for grace</b>, <i>continual accessions of grace </i>; new grace coming upon and superseding the former. <h2><u><b>17.]</u></h2> </b>The connexion of this verse with the foregoing lies in the words <b>his fulness </b>(ver. 16), and <b>in grace and truth </b>(ver. 14). ‘We received from His fulness continual additions of grace, <i>because that fulness is not, like the law, a positive enactment, finite and circumscribed</i>, of which it could be said that it <b>was given</b>, but the <i>bringing in of grace and truth</i>, which <b>came </b>(came in, came to pass) by Jesus Christ.’ The <b>fulness </b>of Christ is set against the <i>narrowness of positive enactment </i>in the law. The distinction must not be lost sight of, nor denied, as Lücke attempts to do: for Bengel truly observes: “No philosopher places his words so accurately, and observes their minute differences, as John, especially in this chapter.” <h2><u><b>18.]</u></h2> </b>The connexion is: ‘Moses could not give out of the <i>fulness </i>of grace and truth, for he had no <i>immediate </i>sight of God, and no man can have: there is but One who can <i>declare </i>God, the <i>only-begotten Son</i>, who is no mere <i>man</i>, but abides in the bosom of the Father.’ The <i>sight of God </i>here meant, is not only bodily sight (though of that it is true, see Exod. xxxiii. 20: 1 Tim. vi. 16), but <i>intuitive </i>and <i>infallible knowledge</i>, which enables him who has it to declare the nature and will of God; see ch.iii. 11; vi. 46; xiv. 7.<br><br>The Evangelist speaks in this verse in accordance with the sayings of the Alexandrine philosophy, whose phraseology he has adopted: <i>Who hath seen Him, that he might tell us? </i>Ecclus. xliii. 31.<h3><u><b>the only-begotten Son]</u></h3> </b>A remarkable various reading, <b>the only-begotten God</b>, occurs here in many of our oldest MSS., versions, and Fathers. The evidence for and against it is given in full in my Gr. Test. (edn. 6.) It seems to have arisen from a confusion of the contracted forms of writing the words “<i>Son</i>” and “<i>God</i>” in the Greek: the former being in our ancient MSS. written ΥC, the latter θC.

It is an interesting enquiry, what this usage denotes as to the author or date of our Gospel. Prof. Bleek has satisfactorily shewn that no inference can be deduced from it <i>against the Jewish origin </i>of the author, as some have endeavoured to do; but it is rather confirmatory of the belief that the Gospel was written after the Jews had ceased to be politically a nation,—and among Gentiles; —the author himself contemplating these last as his readers. <h3><u><b>priests and Levites]</u></h3> </b>This was a <i>formal deputation</i>;— priests and Levites, constituting the two classes of persons employed ahout the service of the temple (see Josh. iii. 3), are sent (Matt. xxi. 23) officially to enquire into the pretensions of the new Teacher (ver. 25), who had collected about him such multitudes (Matt. iii. 5), and had awakened popular expectation that he was the Messiah (Luke iii. 15). <h3><u><b>Who art thou?]</u></h3> </b>The emphasis should be on the <b>thou</b>. “The question is asked with reference to the popular doubts respecting him; in an unbelieving and inquisitorial spirit,— compare Matt. iii. 7 ff., which had already taken place.

This emphatic notice of his declaration seems to be introduced <i>not with any view of removing too high an estimate of John’s work and office</i>, as sometimes supposed, but rather to <i>shew the importance of his testimony</i>, which was so publicly and officially delivered,—that the Messiah was come (see ch. v. 33—35); and the way in which he depreciated himself in comparison with Him who came after him. <h2><u><b>21.]</u></h2> </b>Our earliest MS.

Besides, his announcement that <i>the Kingdom of God was at hand</i>, naturally led them to the prophecy Mal.iv.5. Lightfoot cites from the Rabbinical books testimonies, that the Jews expected a general purification or baptism before the coming of the Messiah (from Ezek. xxxvi.25,26, and Zech.xiii.1), and that it would be administered by Elias.<h3><u><b>And he saith, I am not]</u></h3> </b>The right explanation of this answer seems to be the usual one,—that the deputation asked the question in a mistaken and superstitions sense, meaning Elias bodily come down from heaven, who was expected to forerun and anoint the Messias. (Our Lord seems to refer to the same extravagant notion in Matt.xi.14, <b>If ye will receive it, </b><i>this is Elias, which shall come</i>.) <i>In this sense</i>, John was not Elias; nor indeed in any other sense, <i>was </i>he Elias ;—but only (Luke i.17) <i>in the spirit and power of Elias.</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDJ7kndrGxJjg5h3_rBfFkn_XmYRwlxI/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In Matt. xvi. 14 we have ‘<i>Jeremiah, or one of the prophets</i>,’ apparently spoken as representing this expected prophet. There seem to have been various opinions about him ;—all however agreeing in this, that he was to be <i>one of the old prophets raised from the dead </i>(see also 2 Macc.ii.1–8). This John was not: and he therefore answers this also in the negative.<h2><u><b>22.]</u></h2></b> Notice—they ever ask about his <i>person</i>: he ever refers them to his <i>office</i>. He is no one—a <i>voice </i>merely: it is the work of God, the testimony to Christ, which is every thing. So the formalist ever in the church asks concerning any one who appears, <i>Who is he</i>? while the witness for Christ only exalts, only cares for Christ’s work. <h2><u><b>23.]</u></h2> </b>These words, which by the other Evangelists are spoken of John as the fulfilment of the prophecy,appear from this place to have been first so used by <i>himself</i>. They introduce the great closing section of the prophecy of Isaiah (ch.xl.–lxvi.) so full of the rich promises” and revelations of the Messiah and His kingdom. <br><br><b>Make straight (straighten) </b>is used as compendiously expressing the commands in the prophecy. <br><br>By implication, the Baptist, quoting this opening prophecy of himself, announces the approaching fulfilment of the whole section. <h2><u><b>24. Now they had been sent by the Pharisees]</u></h2> </b>The reason of this explanation being added is not very clear. Lücke refers it to the apparent hostility of the next enquiry: but I confess I cannot see that it is more hostile than the preceding. Luthardt thinks that it imports, there were some of the deputation present, who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees, which the words will hardly bear. Might it not be to throw light on their question about <i>baptizing</i>, as the Pharisees were the most precise about all ceremonies, lustrations, &c.? Thus the explanation will refer to the nature of the following question. <h2><u>25.]</u></h2> This question shews probably that they did not interpret Isa. xl. 3 of any herald of the Messiah. They regarded baptism as a significant token of the approach of the Messianic Kingdom, and they asked, ‘Why baptizest thou, if thou art no forerunner of the Messiah?” <h2><u><b>26, 27.]</u></h2> </b>The latter part of ver. 26 and beginning of ver. 27, as read in our oldest and best authorities, runs, as in the corrected text, <b>There standeth one among you whom ye know not, He that cometh after me. </b><br><br>The insertions, “<i>it is</i>,” and “<i>is preferred before me</i>,” have been made by some one not. aware of the meaning, and wishing to square the verse with vv. 15, 30. The answer of the Baptist seems not to correspond to the question in ver. 25. This was noticed as early as Heracleon (Century II), who said, <i>John answers the deputation from the Pharisees not with reference to what they asked, but what he himself chose. </i>This however is impugned at some length by Origen, but not on very<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEL5UERPmqmOu7s9qIWKu29jeplZRXXl/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The truth seems to have been apprehended by Olshausen,—that the declaration of John that the Messiah was standing among them at that moment unknown to them, <i>was an answer to their question demanding a legitimation of his prophetic claims ;—a sign </i>that he was sent from God :—see ch. ii. 18. Olshausen also suggests that this may clear up the saying of the Jews in ch. x, 41 (see note there). In repeating this saying at other times (see Matt. iii. 11 and parallel places), the Baptist plainly states of the Messiah, that he should baptize them with the Holy Ghost (and fire), as here in ver. 33. Here, in speaking to those learned in the offices of the Messiah, he leaves that to be supplied. <h3><u><b>whose shoe's latchet....]</u></h3> </b>See note on Matt. iii. 11. ‘The <b>latchet </b>is the <i>thong </i>of the shoe or sandal, with which it was bound to the foot. <h2><u><b>28.]</u></h2> </b>The common reading, <i>Bethabara</i>, is owing to a conjecture of Origen, the grounds of which he thus states:— <i>“We are not ignorant, that in almost all our copies it is stated, ‘these things were done in Bethany;’ </i>and this seems to have been so read even before our time: for I have read it so in Heracleon. But I am persuaded that we ought not to read <i>Bethany, but Bethabara </i>; for I have been on the spot, in my desire to track the footsteps of Jesus and of His Apostles and of the prophets. Bethany, as the Evangelist himself says, is only fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem, far away from the river Jordan, about 180 furlongs, roughly stated. Nor is there any place near the Jordan of the same name as <i>Bethany</i>: but <i>they say that a place is shewn </i>on the bunks of the Jordan called <i>Bethabara</i>, where they relate that John baptized.” He goes on to shew from the <i>etymology of the names </i>that it must have been Bethabara; an argument which modern criticism will not much esteem. It will be seen that his testimony is decisive for the universality and authority of the reading <b>Bethany</b>, while for the other he only produces a tradition, and that only at second-hand: <i>‘they say </i>that such a place is shewn.’ That no Bethany beyond Jordan was known in his time proves but little;— for 300 eventful years had changed the face of Palestine since these events, and the names and sites of many obscure places may have been forgotten. I abstain from enumerating modern conjectures on the identity of the two, or the etymology of the names, as being indecisive and unprofitable. The objection of Paulus, that <i>beyond Jordan </i>the Sanhedrim had no authority, appears not to be founded in fact. <br><br>The question whether this testimony of the Baptist is identical with that given by the other three Evangelists, especially by St. Luke (iii. 16), is, after all that has been said on it, not of great importance. The whole series of transactions here recorded, from ver. 15 onwards, certainly happened <i>after </i>the baptism of our Lord ;—for before that event John <i>did not know Him as He that was to come</i>: and <i>“standeth among you,” </i>ver. 26, shews that <i>he had so recognized Him </i>(see below on <i>“the next day”</i>): whereas the testimony in Luke iii. 16 and parallel places, is as certainly given <i>before </i>the baptism. But since the great end of John’s mission was to proclaim Him who was coming after him, it is not only probable, but absolutely necessary to suppose, that he should have delivered this testimony <i>often</i>, and under varying circumstances: <i>before </i>the baptism, in the form given by St. Luke, “<i>One mightier than I cometh</i>,” &c., and <i>after </i>it in this form, “<i>This is He of whom I said</i>,” &c. (ver. 15), where his former testimony is distinctly referred to. And among John’s disciples and the multitudes who frequented his baptism, many reports of such his sayings would naturally be current. So that there is neither a real nor even an apparent contradiction between John and the other Evangelists. <br><br>It is a far more important question, <i>in what part of this narration the forty days’ Temptation is to be inserted. </i>From ver. 19 to ch. ii. 1 there is an unbroken sequence of days distinctly marked. Since then ver. 19 must be understood as happening after the baptism, it must have happened <i>after the Temptation </i>also. And in this supposition there is not the slightest difficulty. But when we have made it, it still remains to say whether at that time our Lord had returned from the Temptation or not. The general opinion of Harmonists has been, that the approach of Jesus to John in ver. 29 <i>was His return after the Temptation. </i>But this I think questionable, on account of the “<i>standeth among you</i>,” ver. 26; which I can only understand literally. I therefore believe - – —<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s49uJjAfOD_Beu0JOWtq_-U4FdUmiHK5/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

I understand it therefore literally, both here and .in vv. 35 and 44. <h3><u><b>coming unto him]</u></h3> </b>It is not said <i>whence</i>, or <i>why</i>, or whether for the purpose of an interview, or not; <i>the fact </i>merely is related, for the sake of the testimony which follows. I mention this, because on these points difficulties have been raised. <h3><u><b>Behold the Lamb of God]</u></h3> </b>This is one of the most important and difficult sayings in the New Testament. <i>The question to be answered </i>is, In calling Jesus by so definite a name as <b>the Lamb of God</b>, <i>to what </i>did John refer? And this question is intimately connected with that of the meaning of the following words, <b>which taketh away the sin of the world. </b><br><br>(a) The title must refer to <i>some “known and particular lamb</i>, and cannot be a mere figure for a just and holy man, as some suppose. It is inconceivable, that <i>the Lamb of God </i>should, in a testimony so precise and formal as this of the Baptist, be <i>nothing but an hyperbole</i>, and that one <i>wholly unprecedented</i>, and to his hearers <i>unintelligible</i>. Had no doctrinal considerations been at stake, we may safely say that this interpretation would never have been proposed. In its bearing on the latter clause of the verse, it is equally untenable. These interpreters make <i>which taketh away the sin of the world </i>to mean, “who shall, though innocent, have, throughout his life, grievous experience of the wickedness of men, but shall, like a lamb, bear the evils inflicted upon him with a patient and gentle mind” (Gabler); or, “He shall remove the sins of men, i.e. wickedness, out of the earth.” ‘The first of these meanings of the verb rendered “<i>takeaway</i>” is <i>altogether without example</i>. The second, though common enough in other connexions, is never found in connexion with “<i>sin</i>.” The common sense account of this part of the matter is:— John wished to point out Jesus as <i>the Messiah</i>: he designates Him as <i>the lamb of God</i>; he therefore referred to some definite lamb,—revealed by God, sent by God, pleasing to God, or in some meaning especially, <b>of God</b>. <i>Whence did this idea come? </i><br><br>(b) Can John have referred to the <i>paschal lamb</i>? Further than the very use of the name brings in with it the general typical use of the animal, and thus this particular use may lie in the background, <i>I think not</i>,—and for this reason ;—The <i>ruling idea </i>in the paschal sacrifice has no connexion, in any sense of the words, with <i>taking away sin</i>. However, by the light <i>now </i>thrown back on it since the Spirit has opened the things of Christ, <i>we </i>discern this typical meaning in the sprinkling of the blood (see 1 Cor. v. 7),—in the <i>Jewish mind</i>, no mention being made of sin or the removing of sin in any connexion with the paschal lamb, the two could not be brought forward, in such an announcement as this, in close connexion with one another.<br><br>(c) Can the reference be to the <i>lamb of the daily morning and evening sacrifice</i>? or to the <i>sacrificial lamb </i>generally? With’ the same reservation as above, <i>I think not</i>: for (1) this expression is too definite to have so general and miscellaneous a reference; (2) of many animals which were used for sacrifice, the lamb was <i>only one</i>, and that one <i>not by any means so prominent as.to serve as a type for the whole</i>: and (3) the lamb (with only two exceptions, Levit. iv. 32: Num. vi. 14, in both which cases it was to be a <i>female</i>, as if for express distinction from the ordinary use of the lamb) <i>was never used for a sin-offering</i>, properly so called and known. The <i>question ts not</i>, whether Christ be not typified by all these offerings, which we <i>now know </i>to be the case (1 Pet. i. 19 al.), but whether <i>the Baptist is likely to have referred to them in such words as these. </i>(d) There remains but one reference, and that is, to <i>the prophetic announcement in Isa</i>. liii. 7.

We have there the servant of God (the Messiah) compared to <i>a lamb brought to the slaughter </i>(liii. 7), and it is said of Him (ib. ver. 4), “He hath borne our griefs (in the LXX, “beareth our sins”) and carried our sorrows” — ver. 5, “He was wounded for our transgressions”—ver. 6, “The Lord hath laid on Him the iniquity of us all” (in the LXX, “delivered Him to our sins”)—ver.8, “He was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgression of my people was He stricken ”—ver. 12, “He bare the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors” (in the LXX., “and was delivered because of their iniquities”). So that here, and here only, we have the connexion of which we are in search,— between <i>the lamb</i>, and the <i>bearing or taking away of sin</i>,—expressly stated, so that it could be formally referred to in a testimony like the present. And I have therefore no doubt that <i>this was the reference</i>. <br><br>(e) We have now to enquire into the specific meaning of <b>which taketh away the sin of the world </b>(see above under [a]). The verb rendered taketh away answers to a Hebrew verb, which is used frequently in the O. T., in connection with <i>sin</i>, in the sense of <i>bearing its punishment</i>:—see Levit. xxiv. 15: Num. v. 31; xiv. 3: Ezek. iv. 5; xxiii, 35a]. A form of this very Greek verb is used by the LXX in the sense of taking away sin and its guilt by expiation: see in our English Bible, Levit.x.17. The word in our verse will bear either of these meanings, or both conjoined; for if the Lamb is to suffer the burden of the sins of the world, and to take away sin and its guilt by expiation, this result must be accomplished by the <i>offering of Himself</i>. <br><br>(f) But it is objected, that this view of a suffering Messiah, and of expiation by the sufferings of <i>one</i>, was <i>alien from the Jewish expectations</i>;—and that the Baptist (see Matt. xi. 2 ff. and note) cannot himself have had any such view. But the answer to this may be found in the fact that the view, though not generally prevalent, among the Jews, was by no means unknown to many. The application by the early Jewish expositors of Isa. liii. to the Messiah, could hardly have been made, without the idea of the suffering and death of their Messiah being presented to their minds. The same would be the case iu the whole sacrificial economy :—the removal of guilt (which was universally ascribed to the Messiah) by suffering and death would be familiarized to their minds. Traces of this are found in their own writings. In 2 Macc. vii. 37, 38, the last of the seven brethren thus speaks before his martyrdom :—“But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the laws of our fathers, beseeching God that He would speedily be merciful unto our nation ; and that thou by torments and plagues mayest confess, that He alone is God: and that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty, which is justly brought upon all our nation, may cease.” And Josephus says of these same martyrs, that they were “as it were a ransom for the nation’s sin: and by means of the blood of those pious ones and the propitiation of their death, divine Providence saved afflicted Israel.” The whole history of the sacrifices and devotions of the heathen world abounds with examples of the same idea variously brought forward; and to these the better-informed among the Jews could be no strangers. And as to the Baptist himself, we must not forget that the power of the Holy Spirit which enabled him to recognize by a special sign the Redeemer, also <i>spoke in him</i>, and therefore his words would not be the result of education merely, or his own reasoning, but of that kind of intuitive perception of divine truth, which those have had who have been for any special purpose the organs of the Holy Ghost. <br><br>As regards Matt. xi. 3, the doubt on the mind of John there expressed does not appear to have touched at all on the matter now in question,—but to have rather been a form of expressing his impatience at the slow and quiet progress of Him of whom he expected greater things and a more rapid public manifestation. <h2><u><b>30.]</u></h2> </b>See on ver. 15. <h2><u><b>31.]</u></h2></b> On the apparent discrepancy between this statement, <b>I knew him not</b>, and St. Matthew’s narrative, I have stated my view on Matt. iii, 14.

De Wette gives the sense well: “This testimony (ver. 30) does not rest upon my long personal acquaintance with Him, but on that which happened during my work of baptizing.” <h3><u><b>but that he should be made manifest]</u></h3>  </b>Justin Martyr represents Trypho the Jew saying, “ Even if Christ has been born and exists somewhere, he is unknown, and is not even conscious of his own identity, until Elias shall come and anoint him, and make him manifest to all.” But our narrative is not built upon any such Jewish belief, for it is evidently only as a <i>spiritual preparation</i>, through repentance, for the knowledge of Him, that John regarded his baptism, not as any thing making Him manifest to all.<h2><u><b>32, 33.]</u></h2> </b>“What follows, is testimony, properly so called: what is said from ver. 29 f. <i>was demonstration following on testimony</i>. In the continued discourse of the Baptist the Evangelist as it were interposes a parenthesis, ‘<i>And John bare witness, saying</i>,’” Bengel. <br><br>The occurrence related by John happened <i>at the baptism </i>of Jesus, which is therefore here <i>pre-supposed as known</i>, Although this has been questioned, I cannot see how it can be reasonably doubted. We cannot surely suppose that such a sign was <i>twice </i>shewn. On the appearance itself, see note Matt. iii. 16. The account here given confirms the view which I have there maintained, that the appearance was confined to our Lord and the Baptist : <i>he </i>was to receive the sign, and then to testify to the others, who were not themselves yet the bearers, but the recipients of testimony :— “It was seen, in a kind of spiritual vision, by John alone.” Theodore of Mopsuestia.<br><br><b>I have beheld</b>, in reference to the sign divinely intimated to him, in the abiding fulfilment of which he now stood. So again, below, ver. 34. <h3><u><b>it remained upon him]</u></h3> </b>By some appearance which is not described, the Holy Spirit was manifested to John as <i>not removing from Jesus again, but remaining on Him</i>. But we are not to understand that he had seen the Spirit descending on <i>others</i>, and <i>not remaining</i>; for (see ch. vii. 39; Acts i. 5; xix. 2 ff. (the gift of the Holy Spirit did not ordinarily accompany John’s baptism, but only in this one case; and its occurrence was to point out to him the Messiah. <h3><u><b>the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost]</u></h3> </b>Here again we seem to have a reference to the cycle of narratives of the three other Gospels, for our Evangelist has not before mentioned this office of the Messiah.<h2><u><b>34.]</u></h2> </b>A solemn reiteration of his testimony, after the mention of the giving of this token by Him who sent him ;—<b>And I have seen (accordingly) </b>&c.<br><br>The token must have been given to the Baptist <i>by a special revelation</i>, which also revealed to him his own errand and office; so Luke iii. 2, “<i>The word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness</i>.” <br><br>The perfect tense in this verse is stronger than the present,—<b>I have seen </b>(on the perf. see above ver. 32) <b>and have borne witness</b>—it is a reference to his testimony at the time, as a thing on record in their memories, and as still continuing. <h3><u><b>the Son of God]</u></h3> </b>See ver. 18 — the <b>Word </b>made flesh, the Messiah.

It is likely that they were bashful as yet and in perplexity, as being unacquainted with Him.”<br><br>They ask <b>where dwellest thou</b>? wishing to find Him alone and in quiet. Euthymius. They enquire after <i>His place of lodging for the night</i>, intending to visit Him there ; or perhaps He was then apparently going thither, as it was late in the day. But He furthers their wish by inviting them to follow, and they will see.<h2><u><b>39. about the tenth hour]</u></h2> </b>i.e. 4 P.M., according to the Jewish reckoning; not, as some have thought, 10 A.M., according to that of the Romans.

And as Lücke remarks, even among the Romans, the division of the day into twelve equal hours was, though not the civil, the popular way of computing time.<br><br>They remained with Him <i>the rest of that day</i>, which would be four or five hours, and need not strictly be limited by sunset. ? ,<h2><u><b>40.]</u></h2> </b>Who the other disciple was, is not certain: but considering (1) that the Evangelist <i>never names himself </i>in his Gospel, and (2) that this account is so minutely accurate as to specify even the hours of the day, and in all respects <i>bears marks of an eye-witness</i>, and again (3) that this other disciple, from this last circumstance, certainly <i>would have been named</i>, had not the name been suppressed <i>for some especial reason</i>, we are justified in inferring that it was <i>the Evangelist himself</i>.

But <b>Follow me </b>does not here bear its strict apostolic sense; the expression, “<i>We have found</i>” afterwards, and the going to search for others to be disciples, unites Philip to the company of those who have been before mentioned, who we know were not immediately or inseparably attached as followers to Jesus. <h2><u><b>44.]</u></h2> </b>This is Bethsaida on the <i>Western </i>bank of the lake of Gennesaret; another Bethsaida (Julias) lay at the top of the lake, on the Jordan. Sce note on Luke ix. 10. <h2><u><b>45.]</u></h2> </b>It does not appear where Nathanael was found: but he is described, ch. xxi. 2, as <i>of Cana of Galilee </i>: and as we find Jesus there in ch. ii. 1, it is probable the call may have taken place in its neighbourhood. Nathanael (meaning, “the gift of God,” corresponding to Theodore or Theodosius in Greek) is mentioned <i>only in these two places</i>. From them we should gather that he was an apostle ; and as his name is nowhere found in the catalogues of the twelve, but Philip is associated in three of them, Matt. x. 3: Mark iii. 18: Luke vi. 14, with <i>Bartholomew</i>, it has been supposed that Nathanael and Bartholomew <i>were the same person </i>(see note on Matt. x. 3). This is however mere conjecture.<h3><u><b>Moses in the law]</u></h3> </b>Probably in Deut. xviii.15; but also in the promises to Abraham, Gen. xvii. 7 al.: and in the prophecy of Jacob, Gen. xlix. 10, and the prophets, passim ; see the references. <h3><u><b>the son of Joseph, which is from Nazareth]</u></h3> </b>This expression seems to shew previous acquaintance<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_7z51sXmlQDaS23Ju9ofX3Mr0uTnQV6M/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

No stress can be laid, as has been most unfairly done, on Jesus being called by Philip, the son of Joseph, as indicating that the history of His birth and childhood, as related by St. Matthew and St. Luke, was <i>unknown to St. John</i>. Philip <i>expresses what was the prevailing belief, in the ordinary words, </i>as Olshausen remarks. In an admirable note, Neander remarks, that by combining the two declarations of John, that <i>in Jesus the Eternal Word of God became flesh </i>(ver. 14), and that <i>‘that which is born of the flesh is flesh’ </i>(ch. iii. 6), we cannot escape the inference, that a <i>supernatural working of God in the conception of the Ban Christ Jesus is implied. </i><h2><u><b>46.]</u></h2> </b>As Lücke observes, the meaning of this question is simpler than at first sight appears. It is impossible that Nathanael, himself a Galilean, could speak from any feeling of contempt for Galilee generally : and we have no evidence that Nazareth was held in contempt <i>among the Galileans</i>. He alluded therefore to the smallness and insignificance of the town in proportion to the great things which were now predicated of it. Nazareth is never named in the O. T. nor in Josephus. <h2><u><b>47.]</u></h2> </b>The Evangelist certainly intends a supernatural insight by the Lord into Nathanael’s character to be here understood; and there is probably no reference at all to the question which Nathanael had just asked. To suppose that Jesus <i>overheard that question</i>, is just one of those perfectly gratuitous assumptions which the very Commentators who here make this supposition are usually the first to blame. Compare ch. ii. 25. <h3><u><b>an Israelite indeed]</u></h3> </b>‘An Israelite who truly answers to the inner and honourable meaning of the name’ When we reflect what was contained in that name, and Who it is that speaks, we can hardly agree with De Wette that the words are spoken merely in the spirit in which every nation attaches some peculiar virtue, and especially those of openness and straightforwardness, to itself.<br><br>Our Lord probably referred to Ps. xv.<h2><u><b>48.]</u></h2></b> The remark was overheard by Nathanael, and recognized as indicating perfect knowledge of his character. The question, <b>Whence knowest thou me</b>? is one of astonishment, but not perhaps yet of suspicion of any thing supernatural. Our Lord’s answer first opens this to him.<h3><u><b>Before that &c.]</u></h3> </b>The whole form of our Lord’s answer seems to indicate that the place where Philip called Nathanael was not <i>now </i>in sight, nor had been. The declaration that Jesus had seen him there, at once brings the conviction which he expresses in the next verse. This would not have been the case, unless the sight had been evidently and unquestionably supernatural : and unless the words “<i>when thou wast under the fig tree</i>” involved this. Had Jesus merely seen Nathanael without being seen by him, or had “<i>I saw thee</i>” only expressed, ‘<i>I knew thy character</i>,’ at first sight, ‘<i>although at a distance, no such immediate conviction would have followed</i>.’<br><br><b>when thou wast under the fig tree</b>, ses Wordsw., “is something more than merely ‘<i>under the fig tree’ </i>would be: it indicates retirement thither as well as concealment there,—perhaps for purposes of prayer and meditation.” In fact it contains in it, ‘when thou wentest under the fig tree, and while thou wert there.’<h2><u><b>49.]</u></h2> </b>The answer expresses, ‘Thou art the Messiah;’ see Ps. ii. 7: ch. xi. 27: Matt. xvi. 16: Luke xxii. 70. Olshausen maintains that <b>the Son of God </b>was not a Jewish appellation for the Messiah,—on account of the Jews taking up stones to cast at Jesus when He so called Himself, ch. x. 33. But as Lücke observes, it was not for the <i>mere use </i>of this Name,—but for using it in a <i>close and literal sense </i>which was unintelligible and appeared blasphemous to them, ‘I and My Father <b>are one</b>,’—that they wished to stone Him; see note on ch, x.36. It was certainly not so common a name as ‘the Son of David, for the Messiah. Nathanael can hardly have meant the name in other than its popular meaning;<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zrXa9WnCGBchyauVTERM_-CdnxpfShEh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The question is perhaps most natural here: but see notes on the similar sentences, ch. xvi. 31, and ch. xx. 29. <h2><u><b>51.]</u></h2> Verily, verily </b>is peculiar to St. John. ‘The other Evangelists use ‘verily’ <i>once </i>only in such asseverations. Stier remarks, that the <b>Verily, verily, I say unto you of the Lord</b>, is spoken in His coequality with the Father: not as the ‘Thus saith the Lord’ of the prophets. <h3><u><b>unto you]</u></h3> </b>The words following are then spoken to all the disciples present, not only to Nathanael. <br><br>With or without <b>From henceforth</b>, the meaning will be much the same. The glories of a period beginning from the opening of the Lord’s public ministry, and <i>at this day not yet completed</i>, are described. For it is not the outward visible opening of the material heavens, nor ascent and descent, of angels in the sight of men, which our Lord here announces; but the series of glories which was about to be unfolded in His Person and Work from that time forward. Luther beautifully says: “When Christ became man and had entered on His ministerial office and begun to preach, then was the heaven opened, and remains open; and has from that time, since the baptism of Christ in the Jordan, never been shut, and never will be shut, although we do not see it with our bodily eyes... Christ says this: ‘Ye are now heavenly citizens, and have your citizenship above in the heavenly Jerusalem, and are in communion with the holy angels, who shall without intermission ascend and descend about you.’”<br><br>The <b>opening of heaven </b>is a symbolical expression, signifying the imparting of divine grace, help, and revelation. See Gen, xxviii. 10—17: Ezek. i. 1: Isa. vi. 1: Mal. iii. 10: Isa, lxiv. 1: also Deut, xi. 17: 1 Kings viii. 35. The words have a plain reference to the <i>ladder of Jacob</i>, and imply that what he then saw was now to receive its fulfilment: that He, the Son of Man, was the dwelling of God and the gate of Heaven, and that <i>through </i>Him, and <i>on </i>Him in the first place, was to descend all communication of help and grace from above. <br><br>That no allusion is meant to the Transfiguration, or the Agony, is plain; for <i>all </i>those here addressed did not witness these appearances, but Peter and John only; nor to the Ascension, for they did not see heaven opened, nor did angels ascend nor descend. <br><br>The above has, remarks Olshausen, been the interpretation of all Commentators of any depth in all times: Origen as well as Augustine, Luther as well as Calvin, Lücke as well as Tholuck : and I may add, De Wette as well as Stier.<h3><u><b>the Son of man]</u></h3> </b>An expression originally (as appears) derived, in its Messianic sense, from Dan. vii. 13, 14, and thenceforward used as one of the titles of the Messiah (see ch. xii. 34). It is never predicated of our Lord by any but Himself, except in Acts vii. 56 by Stephen, in allu sion apparently to Matt. xxvi. 64, and— which is hardly an exception—in the passages of the Revelation (ch. i. 13; xiv. 14) which are almost citations from Daniel.<h1><u><b>CHAP.

Josephus calls it “a <i>village of Galilee</i>.” There is a Kanah in Josh. xix. 28, in the tribe of Asher, which must be distinct from this.

If his calling took place in its neighbourhood, our Lord may have gone on and spent the intervening day at Nazareth. Dr. Robinson satisfactorily establishes that Kâna-el-Jelîl, about 3 hours N. 1/2 E. from Nazareth, is the site of this miracle. The name is identical, and so stands in the Arabic Version of the N. T. He shews this to have been recognized in early tradition, and its honour to have been only recently usurped. by Kefr Kenna, a village 1 1/2 hour N.E. from Nazareth, on one of the roads to Tiberias. See a very interesting description of Kâna-el-Jelîl in “The Land and the Book,” pp. 426, 427. <h3><u><b>the mother of Jesus]</u></h3> </b>St. John <i>never names </i>her, as being already well known : or perhaps more probably from his own intimate connexion with her, in pursuance of the injunction cb. xix. 26, 27. He never names either himself, or his own brother, James.<h2><u><b>2. and his disciples]</u></h2> </b>It does not appear <i>who these were</i>, unless we assume that they were those called in ch. i., which seems most probable. John himself was most likely present. He does not relate so circumstantially any thing which he had not witnessed. <br><br>In this case, there must have been some other reason for the invitation, besides mere previous acquaintance, This would be the probable reason for <i>Jesus himself </i>being invited; but the <i>disciples</i>, being from various places in the district, can hardly <i>all have been </i>(De Wette) <i>friends of the family</i>. 'The fact of Jesus having attached disciples to Himself must have been known, and they were doubtless invited <i>from consideration to Him.</i> <br><br>Our Lord at once opens His ministry with the character which He gives of himself, Matt. xi. 18, 19, as distinguished from the asceticism of John. He also, as Trench admirably remarks (Miracles, edn. 2, p. 98, note), gives us his own testimony against the tendency which our indolence ever favours, of giving up those things and occasions to the world and the devil, which we have not Christian boldness to mingle in and purify. Even Cyprian, for instance, proscribes such festivals,—“ Let the wicked feasts and licentious banquets at marriages be avoided, of which the contagion is perilous.” And such is the general verdiet of modern religionism, which would keep the leaven distinct from the lump, for fear <i>it </i>should become <i>unleavened</i>. ‘The especial honour conferred upon <i>marriage </i>by the Lord should also be noticed. ‘He here adorned and beautified it with his presence, and first miracle that he wrought.”<h2><u><b>3.]</u></h2> </b>There is no necessity to suppose that the feast had lasted several days, as Do Wette and Lücke do. It has been suggested that the unexpected presence of the disciples may have occasioned a failure in the previously sufficient supply : a gloss in one of the old Latin MSS. has, “And it came to pass, that through the great number of guests the wine was used up.”<br><br>The mother of Jesus evidently is <i>in a position of authority </i>(see ver. 5) in the house, which was probably that of a near relative. The conjectures and traditions on the subject are many, and wholly unsatisfactory. <br><br>A graver question arises as to the intent with which this, <b>They have no wine</b>, was said. She cannot have had <i>from experience </i>any reason to suppose that her Son would work a miracle, for this (ver. 11) <i>was His first</i>. Chrysostom and others suggest that, knowing Him to be Who He was, she had been by the recent divine acknowledgment of Him and His calling disciples to Himself, led to expect the manifestation of His Messianic power about this time; and here seemed an occasion for it. Some of the other explanations are: “that she had always found Him a wise counsellor, and mentioned the want to Him merely that He might suggest some way of remedying it.” Cocceius. “Do thou depart, that the other guests may do the same, before the lack of wine is noticed.” Bengel. “That by some pious exhortation He might prevent the guests from feeling annoyance, and at the same time spare the bridegroom’s shame.” Calvin, “Jesus had wrought miracles, but in secret, before this.” Tholuck. <br><br>On the whole, the most probable explanation is that of Lücke, which somewhat modifies the first hero mentioned,—that our Lord Himself had recently given some reason to expect that He would shew forth His glory by wonderful works. So, very nearly, Stier.<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 1, Part 2, John, Pages 84-190 missing.</h2><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bcG7c_yx8NsBtZxAAfndnUllhvh7Dcmt/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Satan <i>entered fully</i> into him, took full possession of him,—so that his will was not only bent upon doing the deed of treachery, but fixed and determined to do it <i>then and there</i>. The words must be understood literally, not as merely betokening the decision of his mind in the direction of the devil’s counsels.<h3><u><b>What thou doest (art doing)...]</u></h3></b> These words are not to be evaded, as being <i>permissive</i> or <i>dismissive</i> (this latter view is taken by Chrysostom, who says, “The words are not to be taken as commanding or exhorting, but as reproaching, and intimating that there was in him the wish to act decidedly, but as he was undecided, the Lord permits him to depart aud do it”). They are like the saying of God to Balaam, Num. xxii. 20,—and of our Lord to the Pharisees, Matt. xxiii. 32. The <i>course of sinful action is presupposed</i>, and the command to go on is but the echo of that mysterious appointment by which the sinner in the exercise of his own corrupted will becomes the instrument of the purposes of God. Thus it is not “ <i>What thou art about to do</i>,” but—that <b>which thou art doing</b>, hast just now fully determined to put in present action, <b>do quickly—</b>reproving his lingering, and his pretending (Matt. ver. 25) to share in the general doubt. <h2><u><b>28.]</u></h2></b> Not even St. John: who knew he was the traitor, but had no idea the deed was so soon to be done. Stier supposes St. John to <i>exclude </i>himself in saying “<i>no man at the table</i>,” and that <i>he</i> knew. <h2><u><b>29.]</u></h2></b> The first supposition agrees with ver. 1,—that it was “<i>before the feast of the passover</i>.” Had it been the night of the passover, the next day being hallowed as a sabbath, nothing <i>could have been bought</i>. On the whole question see notes on Matt. xxvi. 17, and cy xviii. 28. On the <i>second</i> supposition, see ch. xii. 5.

It is perhaps fanciful to see, as many have done, an allusion to the <i>darkness</i> in Judas’s soul, or to the fact expressed in Luke xxii. 53, “<i>this is your hour, and the power of darkness</i>;” though doubtless <i>there</i> the Lord alludes to its being <i>also night</i> : but I quite feel, with Meyer, that there is something awful in this termination—<b>it was night.</b> <b> 31—XVI. 38.]</b> HIS LOVE IS KEEPING AND COMPLETING HIS OWN.And herein,<h2><u><b>31—XIV.31.]</u></h2></b> <i>He comforts them with the assurance that He is going to the Father. </i> <b>31—88.]</b> <i>Announcement of the fact— its effect on Peter.</i> Here commences that solemn and weighty portion of the Gospel (ch. xiii. 81—xvii. 26) which Olshausen not without reason calls ‘the most holy place’ He beautifully remarks, ‘These were the last moments which the Lord spent in the midst of His own before His Passion, and words full of heavenly meaning flowed during them from His holy lips:—all that His heart, glowing with love, had yet to say to His own, was com- pressed into this short space of time. At first the conversation with the disciples takes more the form of usual dialogue: reclining at the table, they mournfully reply to and question Him. But when (ch. xiv. 81) they had risen from the super, the discourse of Christ took a higher form: surrounding their Master, the disciples listened to the Words of Life, and seldom spoke (only ch. xvi.17,29). Finally, in the sublime prayer of the great High Priest, the whole Soul of Christ flowed forth in earnest intercession for His own to His Heavenly Father’ Olsh. ii. 329.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12DcRYu9Wk0tyd-3jWsGfedqIr_FsEF9t/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Now is the Son st man glorified</b>]</u></h2> It was not that the <i>presence of </i>Judas, as some have thought, hindered the great consummation imported by this <i>glorification</i>, but that the work on which he was gone out, was the ACTUAL COMMENCEMENT <i>of that consummation</i>. “Now at length,” says Lampe, “as if an obstacle were broken down, the rushing rivers of grace flow from the lips of Jesus.” It is true that Judas’s presence hindered the <i>expression</i> of these gracious words. The glorification is spoken of by anticipation, as if accomplished, because the deed was actually in doing, which was to accomplish it. The glorifying spoken of here, and in ver. 32, is not the same. <i>This</i> is the glorifying of God by Christ on earth, in His course of obedience as the Son of Man, which was completed by His death (“<i>he became obedient even unto death</i>,” Phil. ii. 8). And His death was the sition-point between God being glorified in Him, and He being glorified in God—manifested to be the Son of God with power by His resurrection, and received up to the Father, to sit at the right hand of God. This latter (ver. 32) is spoken of by Him here as future, but immediate (<b>straightway</b>) on His death, and leads on to the address in ver. 33. <h2><u><b>32</b>.]</u></h2> <b>in himself</b> is in God (the Father), not in Christ. The word <b>himself</b> reflects back on the <i>subject</i> of the sentence: and <b>in</b> does not mean ‘<i>by means of</i>,’ but keeps its literal force;—by the resurrection of Him <i>into</i> that glory, which He had indeed before, but now has <i>as the Son of Man</i>, with the risen Manhood; so “<i>glorify thou me with thyself</i>,” ch. xvii. 5. Grotins compares 1 Sam. ii. 30, which stands in the LXX, “<i>them that glorify me I will glorify</i>.’ Origen remarks, “The Father recompenses to Him more than the Son of<br><br>Man hath done.” <h2><u><b>33. Little children</b>]</u></h2> This term,—<i>here only</i> used by Christ,—affectingly expresses His not only brotherly, but fatherly love (Isa. ix. 6) for His own, and at the same time their immature and weak state, now about to be left without Him. <h3><u><b>as I said unto the Jews]</u></h3></b> “He would not say this to his disciples before, but to those who rejected Him.” Bengel. But naturally the two clauses, ‘Ye shall seek Me and not find Me, and shall die in your sins,’ also spoken to the Jews (ch. vii. 33 ; viii. 21), are here omitted: and by this omission the connexion with ver. 34 is supplied;—‘ Ye shall be left here: but, unlike the Jews, ye shall seek Me and shall find Me, and the way is that of Love,—to Me, and to one another—forming (ver. 35) an united Body, the Church, in which all shall recognize My presence among you as My disciples.’<h2><u><b>34.]</u></h2></b> The <i>newness</i> of this commandment, consists in its <i>simplicity</i>, and (so to speak) <i>unicity</i>. The same <i>kind</i> of love was prescribed in the Old Test. (see Rom. xiii. 8):—‘as thyself’ is the <i>highest</i> measure of love, and it is therefore not in degree that the new commandment differs from the old, nor in <i>extent</i>, but in being <i>the</i> commandment of the new covenant,—the firstfruit of the Spirit in the new dispensation (Gal. v. 22); see 1 John ii.7,8 (and note), where the word <b>new</b> is commented on by the Apostle himself. <h2><u><b>35.]</u></h2></b> <b>all men,—all the world,—</b>and the object is to be, not mere vain praise or display before the world, but that men may be attracted by the exhibition of the Spirit of Christ, and won over to Him.

Many (as in A.V. take the first as indic., the second as imper., ‘<i>Ye believe in God : believe also in me.’</i> But this is inconsistent with the whole tenour of the discourse, which presupposes a want of belief in God in its full and true sense, as begetting <i>trust</i> in Him. Luther takes <i>both</i> as indicative.

If not,—if they could not follow Him thither, He would not have concealed this from them. This latter assurance is one calculated to beget entire trust and confidence; He would not in any matter hold out vain hopes to them; His word to them would plainly state all difficulties and discouragements,—as indeed He does, ch. xv. 18; xvi. 1,4.

The answer to “<i>whither goest thou?</i>” ch. xiii. 37, which Peter seems to have apprehended, was not sufficient for him; see ch. xx. 25: “for he thought,” says Euthymius, “that it was some material place to which the Lord was going, and that the road thither was of the same kind.” <h2><u><b>6.]</u></h2></b> Our Lord inverts the order of Thomas’s question, and in answering it practically, <i>for them</i>, speaks of ‘the Way’ first. <i>He</i> is THE WAY; not merely the Forerunner; which would imply on our part only an outward connexion with Him as His <i>followers</i>: but <i>the way</i>, in and on which we must go, having an inner union with and in Him (see Heb. x. 20). <h3><u><b>the truth]</u></h3></b> more is implied in this title, than “that He ever <i>spoke truth</i>, and what He said was sure to come to pass,” as Euthymius explains it. It is another side of the same idea of <i>the Way</i> ;—God being true, and only approached by and in truth. Christ IS THE TRUTH, in Whom only (Col. ii. 3) that Knowledge of Him is gained, which (ch. xvii. 3) is eternal life. <h3><u><b>the life]</u></h3></b> not merely because “not even death shall separate you from Me,” Euthymius:—but as being THE LIFE (see ver. 19: Gal. ii. 20) of all His in Whom only they who live can come to the living Father (ch. vi. 57). <h3><u><b>no man cometh unto the Father, but by me...]</u></h3></b> This plainly states <i>whither</i> He was going, and <i>the way</i> also: He was going <i>to the Father</i>: and the way was, <i>through Him- self</i>. <h2><u><b>7.]</u></h2></b> See ch. viii. 19. <h3><u><b>from henceforth]</u></h3></b> There is no difficulty, if we bear in mind the <b>now</b> of ch. xiii. 31. The <b>henceforth</b> is the future time, beginning with our Lord’s glorification, which was now at hand. Lücke remarks : <b>‘Henceforth</b> | is not entirely future nor entirely present, but the moment of transition, the identification of the present and future. Christ speaks here by anticipation in reference to the hour of His glorification being come’ (ii. 598). <h2><u><b>8.]</u></h2></b> Philip misunderstands the words <b>ye have seen him</b> to mean ‘<i>seeing in a vision</i>,’—and intimates that <i>one such sight of God</i> would set at rest<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x3ZsPh4j2Y3AZ2ML54uV2xyo7ryyrVQZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This seeing of the Father in Him, is not only seeing His bodily presence, but <i>knowing</i> Him (<b>dost thou not know me?</b>). <h2><u><b>10.]</u></h2></b> See ch. x. 30, 38, and for the latter clause ch. viii. 28, where the contrast is, as here, purposely inexact in <i>diction</i>,—<i>words</i> being placed in one member and <i>works</i> in the other; and, as there, <b>works</b> and <b>words</b> are taken as correlative and co-extensive ; —all the working of the Lord Jesus being a speaking, a <i>revelation of the Father</i>. According to the probably genuine reading in the margin, it will be, <b>doeth his works</b> : they are not Mine, but His, done in and by Me: but <b>in Me</b> present and abiding, so that “he that hath seen Me hath seen the Father.” <h2><u><b>11–24.]</u></h2></b> <i>Jesus will make proof of His abiding union with the Father, in His union with His own</i>: and this vv. 12—14, <i>in answering prayer</i>: vv. 15—17, <i>in the sending of the Spirit</i>: vv. 18 ff., <i>as a pledge of the completion of this union in His personal return</i>. The Lord now unfolds out of these words, <b>the Father dwelleth in Me, doeth his works</b>, the great promise of the Paraclete or Comforter. <h2><u><b>11. for the very works’ sake]</u></h2></b> See ch. x. 38. The object here seems to be, to fix their attention on the <i>works</i> as a plain testimony even to such as could not simply believe so deep a thing on His assertion, and one which — <b>12.]</b> should become a matter felt and known in themselves hereafter,—by virtue of their living union with Him who is gone to the Father, and become the dispenser and channel of the Spirit. ‘He who <i>believes</i> Christ speaking concerning Himself, <i>believes on</i> Christ.’ Bengel. <h3><u><b>greater works than these shall he do]</u></h3></b> This word is not to be evaded (so as to mean <i>greater in number</i>), but taken in its full strict sense. And the keys to its meaning will be found ch. i. 51; v. 20. <i>The</i> works which Jesus did, His Apostles also did,—viz. raising the dead, &c.;—<i>greater works than those</i>, they did —not in <i>degree</i>, but <i>in kind</i> : <i>spiritual</i> works, under the dispensation of the Spirit, which <i>had not yet come in</i>. But they did them <i>not as separate from</i> Him: but <i>in</i> Him, and <i>by</i> Him; and so (ch. v. 21) <i>He</i> is said to do them. The work which He did by Peter’s sermon, Acts ii., was one of these <i>greater works</i>—the firstfruits of the unspeakable gift. <br><br>This union of them with and in Him is expressed here by “<i>the works that</i> <b>I</b> <i>do, shall</i> <b>he</b> <i>do</i> <i>also</i>.” ‘He has sown, we reap; and the harvest is greater than the seed-time.’ Stier. <h2><u><b>13.]</u></h2></b> I have retained the period at the end of ver. 12 (many editors place a comma only and connect this verse with the word <b>because</b> in the former), because the sense remains much the same, and the style is better preserved. <br><br><b>ye shall ask</b>, viz. <i>the Father</i>: so ch. xv. 16; xvi. 23. But this does not exclude, but <i>distinctly includes</i>, prayer to Christ; so blended are these two (as the <i>seeing</i> ver. 9), that we have not “<i>that will </i><b>He</b><i> do,</i>” but, ver. 14, emphatically “<i>that will </i><b>I</b><i> do.</i>” He who prays to the Father, prays to the Son.

And besides, there is added in the original an emphatic <b>I; it is I myself that will do it</b>: shewing that the use of the first person before was emphatic. “This <b>I myself</b> already points to the glorification of Jesus.” Bengel. <h2><u><b>15.]</u></h2></b> is a following out of the condition in the former verse, “<i>Tf ye shall ask any thing</i> <b>in my name</b>:” ‘That <i>way of prayer</i> is the way of <i>loving obedience</i>, in which the Spirit is ever found, and which is only trodden by His help:’— and also of the purpose stated there, “<i>that the Father may be glorified in the Son</i> :” ‘As the Father is honoured in the Son, so must the Son be honoured in you;’ —see ch. xv. 10. <h2><u><b>16.]</u></h2></b> And <i>then</i> the Spirit shall proceed forth upon you. The word rendered <b>I will pray</b> betokens, probably, a manner of asking implying <i>actual presence and nearness</i>,—and is here used of the mediatorial office in Christ’s <i>ascended state</i>. <br><br><b>Comforter</b>—literally <b>Paraclete</b>. Olshausen remarks that the interpretations of this word range themselves in <i>two classes</i>, which again by no means exclude one another :—those of ‘COMFORTER,’ and those of ‘ADVOCATE.’ The etymology of the word requires the <i>latter</i> as its strict meaning, and in this strict meaning it satisfies 1 John ii. 1, “<i>we have an</i> <b>Advocate</b> (<b>Paraclete</b>, as here) <i>with the Father</i>,” but not so all the places where it is used <i>of the Holy Spirit</i>,—nor this verse, where of the Son and Spirit both. And therefore the other meaning,—<b>Comforter</b>, including as it does in its fulness (see Rom. viii. 26, where both, the <i>helping</i> and the <i>interceding</i>, are united) the <i>Advocate</i> also, has been both here and in Germany (Luther has the equivalent term) sanctioned by Christian usage as the most adequate rendering. Wicliff, from whom we have our word <b>Comforter</b>, often used ‘comfort’ for the Latin <i>confortari</i>, which means to strengthen, as e.g. Luke xxii, 43; Acts ix. 19 &c. Thus the idea of <i>help and strength </i>is conveyed by it, as well as of consolation. It was this office, of Comforter in this double sense, which Jesus had filled to His disciples while with them:—and which the Holy Spirit was to fill even more abundantly (and in a higher sense, because their state would be higher) on the removal of Jesus from them. <h2><u><b>17.]</u></h2></b> This Comforter is, not ‘the true Spirit,’— but ‘THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH ;’—the Spirit <i>Who is truth</i>, 1 John v. 6,—of Whom all truth comes, and who alone leads into <i>the whole truth</i>, the truth of God, ch. xvi. 13.<h3><u><b>the world]</u></h3></b> equivalent to the “<i>carnal</i>” of 1 Cor. ii. 14 (where see note), those who live according to the desires of the flesh and the mind, and have no receptivity of the things of God.<h3><u><b>beholdeth]</u></h3></b> This word <b>behold</b>, when used in a spiritual sense, is sometimes equivalent to <b>know</b>: but this cannot be so here, because it is separated from <b>knoweth</b> by <b>neither</b>: ‘<i>recognizes not</i> in His operations, <i>nor knows</i> :’—<b>has neither sight nor knowledge of</b>. <h3><u><b>ye know him]</u></h3></b> present, but spoken of their state as disciples opposed to the world,—and by anticipation, as before.

With the verb in the present, the speaking by anticipation is still stronger. <h2><u><b>18.]</u></h2></b> The original word should be literally rendered, <b>orphans</b>, as indeed it is in the margin of the <b>A. V. </b> The office of the Comforter is to connect the disciples with the Father: if therefore they had Him not, they would be <i>fatherless</i>. The expression is closely connected with “little children” ch. xiii. 33, and, as Euthymius says, springs from paternal compassion. This makes our Lord’s declaration, that He was coming to them, plain, as applying to the coming by the Spirit, who is one with Christ ;—not only to the ultimate personal coming, which is but the last step of the Advent, nor only the bodily coming again to them and not to the world at the Resurrection, which was but a pledge of His lasting presence in the Spirit: see on ver. 3. The <b>coming</b> is (as there) the summary of these —the <i>great Revisitation</i>, in all its blessed progress. The absence of any connecting particle, as “<i>for</i>,” with this clause, arises from the depth of affection in the Lord’s heart. <h2><u><b>19—21.]</u></h2></b> This <b>coming</b> is explained to consist in His presence among them by the life of His Resurrection, which is theirs; by (ver. 20) the witness of the Spirit in their hearts; and (ver. 21) their sanctification by the Spirit in love, and the consequent manifestation of Jesus to them.<br><br>Luthardt attempts to confine this <b>coming</b> (and the whole passage) to the last great Advent, 1 in spite of the plain sense of vv. 19, 20, relying on the analogy of Rev. xxii, 17, and saying that, on the common interpretation, the Church would have no cause to long for her Lord: and so Augustine and others. But manifestly the context is against them: and they must thus explain away many other pa: (e. g. Matt. xviii. 20). The presence Christ by the Spirit is none the less <i>real</i>, for being <i>incomplete</i>. <h2><u><b>19.]</u></h2></b> The <i>immediate</i> <i>reference</i> of this, <b>ye behold me</b>, is to the forty days (see Acts x. 41)—but only as leading on to its wider and deeper reference to the spiritual life. <b>I live</b>, not “<i>I shall live</i>” —the principle of Life being immanent in Him. <b>ye shall live</b>, live in all fulness, including the most blessed sense of life,—the Life of the Spirit,—here and hereafter. <h2><u><b>20.]</u></h2> At that day</b>, <i>no particular day</i> : but ‘each of these periods, as its continually increasing light breaks upon you, shall bring increased knowledge of your unity in Me with the Father, and my dwelling in you by the Spirit’ If any particular day is to be thought of, it would naturally be the Pentecost. <h2><u><b>21.]</u></h2></b> <b>hath … and keepeth</b>,— “that is,” says Augustine, “<b>hath</b>, in memory, and <b>keepeth</b>, in life:” or perhaps more accurately, ‘He who <i>has</i> my commandments, as being my disciple by outward profession (not thus only: but <i>holds</i> them, by the inner possession of a living faith), and <i>keeps</i> them :’ see Luke xi. 28, And this <b>keeping</b> is more of the inner <i>will</i> to keep them, than the absolute observance, which can only follow on high degrees of spiritual advancement.<h3><u><b>I will manifest myself to him]</u></h3></b> by the Holy Spirit: see ch. xvi. 14. This (as Stier observes) is <i>the highest promise which can be made to man</i> (see ver. 23), and yet it is made to <i>every man</i> who <i>has and keeps</i> the commandments of the Lord Jesus.

For (<b>and</b> meaning,—hence you may infer what I am setting forth) <b>the word which ye hear</b> (and which the world <i>keepeth not</i>, but <i>neglects</i>),—<b>is not Mine, but the Father’s</b>. On the gracious and wonderful promise of ver. 23, see Rom. viii. 15. <h2><u><b>25—31.</b>]</u></h2> <i>His farewell, and the parting bequest of His Love.</i><h2><u><b>25.</b>]</u></h2> <b>have I spoken</b> is anticipatory, referring, as “<i>I said</i>” (ver. 26), to the futures, “<i>shall teach,</i>” and “<i>shall bring to remembrance.</i>” Meyer supposes that a <i>pause</i> took place here, and the Lord looks back on what He had said to them. But this does not seem so natural.<h2><u><b>26.</b>]</u></h2> <b>But</b>—as if He had said, ‘I know that ye do not understand them yet: but’ &c. <h3><u><b>the Holy Ghost</b>]</u></h3> The Paraclete, or Comforter, is now more closely defined by this well-known Name,—and, by the words, <b>whom (which) the Father will send</b>, and the pronoun <b>He . ..</b> , designated <i>personally</i>, as One sent, and One acting on them. <h3><u><b>in my name</b>]</u></h3> not, ‘in My stead,’ but <b>in regard of me</b>—‘in answer to My prayer, and prayers in My name,—to those who hear My name,—and as a means of manifesting Me.’ <br><br><b>shall teach you all things</b> stands by itself, not with “<i>whatsoever I have said unto you :</i>” <b>shall teach you all things</b>,—’all that can and may be learnt by you, all that belongs to your work and life in Me.’<h3><u><b>and bring all things to your remembrance</b>]</u></h3> What is <i>not understood</i> is liable to be <i>forgotten</i> ;—and therefore in this word is implied the giving them a right understanding of, as well as recalling, what Jesus had said to them: see ch. ii. 22; xii. 16. <br><br><i>It is on the fulfilment of this promise to the Apostles, that their sufficiency as Witnesses of all that the Lord did and taught, and consequently</i> THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE GOSPEL NARRATIVE<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s3hkhyWiiOooUEElJX-BOuLFHBE_Mu3j/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It was customary to take leave with wishes of peace :—so 1 Sam. i, 17: Luke vii. 50: Acts xvi. 36: 1 Pet. v. 14: 3 John 15. Also, to reassure by such words; see Gen. xliii 23: Judg. vi. 23. But our Lord distinguishes <i>His</i> peace, <i>true</i> peace, ‘<i>the peace which I have and give</i>’ (see ch. xv. 11), from the mere empty word used in the world’s form of greeting. Peace (in general) He <i>leaves</i> with them ;—<i>His</i> peace He <i>gives</i> to them, over and above that other. The words, <b>as the world giveth,</b> must refer, I think, to the world’s <i>manner</i> of <i>giving</i>,—not to the unreality of the world’s peace, of which, however true, there is no direct mention here. The world can only give peace in empty formulæ, saying ‘Peace, peace,’ when there is no peace: Jer. vi. 14 al. <h2><u><b>28.</b>]</u></h2> The former part of the verse gives a reason why their heart should not be <i>troubled</i> ;— then the rest of the verse removes all ground of fear, since it is an <i>exaltation</i> of Him whom they loved, which is about to happen; and therefore a ground of joy, and not of fear. <h3><u><b>my Father is greater than I</b>]</u></h3> And therefore the <i>going</i> of Jesus <i>to the Father</i> is an <i>advancement</i>. This word <b>greater</b>, as Luther well remarks, is not here used as referring to the <i>Nature or Essence of the Son as related to the Father</i>,—but as indicating that particular subordination to the Father in which the Lord Jesus then was,—and the cessation of the state of humiliation, and entering into His glory, which would take place on His being received up to the Father. So also Calvin: “Christ is not here comparing the Divinity of the Father with His own, nor His human nature with the divine essence of the Father, but rather His present state with the heavenly glory to which He was soon to be exalted.” And Cocceius: “The inferiority here is not to be understood as meaning, according to His human nature; for the words point to an inferiority which would be <i>laid aside, on His going to the Father</i>.” And this removes all reason for fear, as <i>they</i> will be exalted in <i>Him</i>. <br><br>The whole doctrinal controversy which has been raised on these words (especially by the Fathers against the Arians), seems not to belong to the sense of the passage. That <i>there</i> ts <i>a sense</i> in which the Father is greater than even the <i>glorified</i> Son, is beyond doubt (see especially 1 Cor. xv. 27 f.) ; but as on the one hand that concession is no concession to Arianism, because it is not in the essential being of the Son, but in His Mediatorial office, that this His inferiority consists,—so on the other hand this verse implies in itself <i>no such</i> inferiority, the discourse being of <i>another kind</i>.<h2><u><b>29.</b>]</u></h2> <b>I have told you</b>—viz. ‘ the prophecies of My Resurrection and Ascension,’ &c.<h3><u><b>ye may believe</b>]</u></h3> See ch. xiii. 19, where the words “<i>that I am He</i>” are supplied. <b>That ye may believe</b>, in the fullest sense of the word. “Not that they did not previously believe Him to be the Son of God: but then, when that was fulfilled in Him, which He had before predieted,— this their faith, which now, when he was speaking to them, was small, and, when He died, was almost extinguished, revived and flourished.” Augustine. See 1 John v. 13.<h2><u><b>30.</b>]</u></h2> <b>I will no more talk much with you</b> :— then, as Stier remarks, He had <i>some</i> words more to say, and was not ahout to break off at ver. 31, as some have supposed.

But Meyer well observes, that this is rather <i>the fact to be assumed</i> as the <i>ground</i> of what is here said, than the <i>thing itself</i> which is said. Tholuck, and many others render it, ‘<i>has no power over me</i>,’ or as Euthymius, <i>finds nothing worthy of death</i>.<h2><u><b>31.</b>]</u></h2> ‘But My Death is an act of voluntary obedience, that it may be known that I love and obey the Father—that the glory of the Father in and by Me may be manifested.’ The construction is elliptic: supply, ‘ But (his power over Me for death will be permitted by Me) that,’ &c. And the period should be at <b>so I do</b>, as in the text. <br><br>Meyer and others would put only a comma here, and carry on the sense, ‘<i>But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father commanded me, thus I do, arise, let us go hence</i>.’ I need only put it to the inner feeling of any who have learned to appreciate the majesty and calmness of our Lord’s discourses, whether a sentence so savouring of theatrical effect is likely to have been spoken by Him. We may notwithstanding safely believe that the words “ <i>Arise, let us go hence,” without this connexion</i>, do undoubtedly express the holy boldness of the Lord in going to meet that which was to come upon Him, and are for that reason inserted hy St. John. <h3><u><b>Arise, let us go hence</b>]</u></h3> These words imply a movement from the table to depart. Probably the rest of the discourse, and the prayer, ch. xvii., were delivered when now all were standing ready to depart. There would be some little pause, in which the preparations for departure would be made. But the <i>place</i> is clearly the same, see ch. xviii. 1, “ <i>when Jesus had spoken these words, He went forth</i> :”—besides which, we can hardly suppose, as Grotius and others, discourses of a character like those in ch. xv. xvi. to have been delivered to as many as eleven persons, while <i>walking by the way</i>, and in a time of such publicity as that of the Paschal feast. Still less is the supposition of Bengel and Beausobre probable,—that ch. xiii. xiv. happened outside the city, and that between ch. xiv. and xv. the paschal meal takes place. Compare also ch. xiii. 30, which is decisive against this idea.<h1><u><b>CHAP. XV. 1–27.</b>]</u></h1> <i>Injunction to vital union in love with Jesus and one another.</i><h2><u>1–11.]</u></h2> <i>Their relation to Him.</i> Various circumstances suggestive of this similitude, of the <i>vine and its branches</i>, have been imagined ; but none of them are satisfactory. The vineyards on the way to Gethsemane,—the carved vine on the great doors of the temple,—a vine trained about the window of the guest-chamber,—are all fanciful, and the two first (see on ch, xiv. 31) inapplicable. The <i>cup</i>, so lately partaken, is certainly nearer,—see below. But I believe that most probably the Lord did not take the similitude from any outward suggesting occasion, but as a means of illustrating the great subject, <i>the inner unity of Himself and His.</i> Occasion enough was furnished, by the Old Test. symbolism of the vineyard and the vine,— Isa. v. 1 ff.; Jer. ii. 21; Ezek. xix. 10 ff., and especially Ps. lxxx. 8–19: by the intimate analogy of vegetable life (of which the tree bearing fruit is the highest kind, and of such trees the vine the noblest) with spiritual, and perhaps also by the <b>fruit of the vine</b> having been so recently the subject of their attention and the Lord’s prophecy, Luke xxii. 18 and the parallel places. <h2><u><b>1.</b>]</u></h2> The Vine and branches stand in a much nearer connexion than the Shepherd and the sheep, or the lord of the vineyard and the vines; and answer to the Head and members in Eph. v. 23, 30; Col. ii. 19, linked together by a common organization, and informed by one and the same life. <h3><u><b>the TRUE vine</b>]</u></h3> not only, ‘the vine by which prophecy is fulfilled:’ not only, ‘the vine in which the organism and qualities of the vine are most nobly realized,’ but, as in ch. i. 9, the <b>true</b>, i.e. the <b>original</b>, or <i>archetypal</i>: that which served for the pattern of all such afterwards. The material creations of God are only inferior examples of that finer spiritual life and organism, in which the creature is raised up to partake of the divine nature; only <i>figures of the true</i>, Heb. ix. 24; “ <i>patterns</i> (i.e. <i>representations</i>) <i>of things in the heavens</i>,” ib. 23; see ch. vi. 32. <h3><u><b>the husbandman</b>]</u></h3> Not<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o60inqxGGSkRIYQ0pdt-1Gfs-dvLqBes/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Who are these <i>unfruitful</i> branches?<i> Who are the branches? </i>Clearly, all those who, adopting the parallel image, are made <i>members</i> of Christ by baptism, Rom. vi. 3, 4; compare <i>“planted together,”</i> ib. ver. 5, also Rom. xi. 17 ff. The Vine is <i>the visible Church here</i>, of which Christ is the <i>inclusive</i> Head: the Vine <i>contains</i> the branches; hence the unfruitful, as well as the fruitful, are in Me. <br><br>Every such unfruitful branch the Father pulls off and casts away: and every one that beareth fruit He prunes, by cleansing it of its worthless parts, and shortening its rank growth, that it may ripen and enlarge its fruit better.<h2><u><b>3.</b>]</u></h2> <b>clean,</b> see ch. xiii. 10. In Eph. v. 26, we have both the <i>washing</i> by reason of the word, and the word itself, united. The <i>word</i> of Christ dwelling in them by Faith (see ver. 7) is the purifying principle (ch. xvii. 17). But the word <b>clean</b> here is not to be taken as equivalent to <i>cleansed</i>, or <i>pruned</i>, in the sense of ver. 2. The ad- verb <b>now</b> or <b>already</b> limits it to their present capacities and standing. There was more pruning at hand, when the sap should begin to flow,— when the Spirit should be shed abroad; and this future handling of the <i>husbandman</i> is indicated by the command, <i>“ Abide in me.” </i><h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2><b> And I in you</b> must not be taken as a <i>promise</i> (<i>“Abide in me, and then I will abide in you”</i>), which (see on ver. 2 above) would be contrary to the sense: but as a clause dependent on the former, ‘Take care that ye abide in Me and I in you:’ <i>both these</i> being necessary to the bringing forth fruit: see ver. 5, where the two are similarly bound together. <br><br>Here the natural strictness of the similitude is departed from. The branch cannot sever itself from the vine: but, <i>such a case supposed</i>, every one will see the inevitable consequence. Bengel says well, “This passage plainly shews the difference between what takes place in nature and what takes place in grace.” It is <i>the permitted free-will of the creature </i>which makes the difference between the branches in the two cases.<h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2> The interpretation of the allegory which each mind was forming for itself, the Lord solemnly asserts for them. Notice the term <b>the</b> <b>same</b> — he and no other: “it is he, that beareth much fruit.”<br><br>The separation indicated in the last clause of the verse is more than ‘<i>without Me,’</i> the words are best rendered <b>apart</b>, or <b>separate from Me</b>, from being in Me and I in you. The word <b>because</b> has respect rather to the sense, than to the words themselves: <i>because</i> union with Me is the sole efficient cause of fruit being produced, you having no power to do any thing, to bring any thing to perfection, to do any of those things which belong to that which ye are, separate from Me. <h2><u><b>6.</b>]</u></h2> This verse is a most important testimony against supra-lapsarian error, shewing us that <i>falling from grace is possible,</i> and pointing out the steps of the fall.

The imperative is used by anticipation, of the future time. This not having been seen, it has probably been altered to the future, as in the A. V.: see ch. xiv. 13. <br><br><b>whatsoever ye will</b>, in the supposed case, is necessarily <i>in the way of God’s will</i>, and as tending to <i>bearing much fruit.</i> <h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Herein</b> belongs to the following words, not the preceding : as in the text. <br><br>The <b>much fruit</b> is not merely ‘large success in the apostolic mission,’ but ‘individual advance in bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit.’<h3><u>According to the reading cited in the margin, the Father’s glorification is continued by another result, and <b>that ye may become My</b> (true) <b>disciples</b>]</u></h3> “It is the <i>foundation</i> of being a Christian, to become a disciple of Christ: it is the <i>completion</i> of being a Christian, to be a disciple of Christ.” Bengel. <br><br>According to the reading with the verb in the future, the actual result of what precedes is stated: <b>and so ye shall become My disciples</b>.<h2><u><b>9.</b>]</u></h2> The Love between the Father and Christ is compared with that between Christ and His disciples. ‘As the Father hath loved the Son, sothe Son His disciples.’<br><br>The words <b>my love</b> may be understood as meaning <i>the love of Me</i> ;—but the sense is not good, and the expression is not parallel with the same expression in ver. 10; so that I prefer <b>my love</b>, <i>the love which I have towards you</i>; remain in it ; do not cast yourselves out of it. The other sense is <i>implied</i> in this, but not expressed.<h2><u><b>10.</b>]</u></h2> The way thus to remain is prescribed; even that way of simple obedience to <i>His</i> Will, which He followed to the Will of the Father. <br><br>On the words <b>my love</b>, see above. <h2><u><b>11. have I spoken</b>]</u></h2> Again anticipatory, hastening to the end of the discourse, and treating it as ended.<h3><u><b>my joy</b>]</u></h3> not ‘<i>joy concerning Me</i>,’ nor ‘<i>joy derived from Me</i>,’ nor ‘ <i>My joy over you</i>,’ but <b>My joy</b>, properly speaking (see 2 Cor. ii. 3, “<i>My joy is the joy of you all</i>”): “His own holy exultation, the joy of the Son in the consciousness of the love of God, of His Unity with the Father: see ver. 10.” (Lücke.) <h3><u><b>and that your joy might be full</b>]</u></h3> That their joy might, by the indwelling of that <i>His Joy</i>, he uplifted and ennobled even to fulness,— to the extreme of their capability and satisfaction,— and might remain so.<h2><u><b>12–17.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Union in love with one another enjoined on them.</i> <h2><u><b>12.</b>]</u></h2> That He may shew them that it is no rigid code of keeping commandments in the legal sense, ver. 11 is inserted, and now <i>the</i> command- ment (as including all others) is again<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rppVVK6Fpy9oJ2rhhNrid5dRazzHIKfw/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But manifestly <i>here</i> the example is from common life, in which if a man did Jay down his life, it would naturally be for his friends; and would be, and is cited as, the greatest example of love. Nor again is there any doctrinal difficulty: our Lord does not assert of himself, that He laid down his life <i>only</i> for his friends (as defined in the next verse), but puts forward <i>this side</i> of his Love as a great and a practical example for his followers. His own great Sacrifice of Himself lies in the background of this verse; but only in the background, and with but one side of it seen, viz. his Love <i>to them</i>. See 1 Tim. iv. 10, and compare 1 John iii. 16.<h2><u><b>14</b>.]</u></h2> parallel to ver. 10,—and like it, guarded, in vv. 15, 16, 17, from legal misinterpretation. <h2><u><b>15</b>.]</u></h2> Spoken, by anticipation, of the state in which He would place them under the Spirit. Nor is there any discrepancy with eh. xiii. 13, 16, and ver. 20 here, which are also spoken of their future condition: for in that sense both relations subsist together. It is the <i>lower sense</i> of the word rendered <b>servant</b> (signifying both <i>servant</i> and <i>slave</i>), which is brought out in this verse. The anticipatory character of the saying is clearly shewn in the words, “ <i>Knoweth not what his lord doeth</i>;” for this was precisely their <i>present</i> condition, but was after His Ascension changed into light and knowledge. <b>I made known unto you</b>] Here again the allusion must be (see chi. xvi. 12) to their future state under the dispensation of the Spirit: nay, even to the fulness and completion of <i>it</i>, as Augustine remarks; compare the confession of one of the greatest. Apostles, 1 Cor. 10. “As we look for immortality of the flesh and salvation of the soul in the future, although, having received the pledge of both, we are said to be already saved: so we should hope for in the future the knowledge of all things which the Only- begotten has heard from the Father, although Christ says He has already made them known to us.” Augustine.<h2><u><b>16</b>.]</u></h2> See 1 John iv.10, 19. Further proof of His love, in his choosing His, when they had not chosen Him. <h3><u><b>appointed</b>]</u></h3> See Acts xili, 47: 1 Thess. v. 9, and reff. Chrysostom and others explain it as meaning “ <i>planted</i>,” in reference to the similitude of the <i>vine</i>. But the parable seems to be no further returned to than in the allusion implied in <i>bearing fruit</i>. “ <i>Ordained</i>,” in A, V., is objectionable, as conveying a wrong idea, that of <i>appointing to the Ministry</i>, which is not here present.<h3><u><b>that ye should go and bear fruit</b>]</u></h3> The word go probably merely expresses (see Matt. xvili. 15; xix. 21, and Luke viii. 14) the activity of living and developing principle; not the missionary journeys of the Apostles, as some have explained it. The fruit is not the Church, to be founded by the Apostles, and endure ;—this is evident, for here the fruit is spoken of with reference to <i>themselves</i>, ard their ripening into the full stature of Christ.

Then from the indefiniteness of this term, <b>one another</b>, our Lord takes occasion to forewarn them that however wide their love to one another, they cannot bring all within this category; there will be still <b>the world</b> outside, which will hate them.<h2><u><b>18–27.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Their relation to the world:</i> and vv. 18–21, <i>ground of the world’s hatred</i>. On the connexion, see above.<h2><u><b>18.</b>]</u></h2> See ch. vii. 7. <br><br>The verb rendered in the A. V. “<i>ye know</i>,” is most likely imperative, <b>know ye</b>. The <i>assertion</i> of their knowledge of the fact would in all likelihood have been otherwise expressed in the original. See more in the note in my Greek Test. The great proof of this hatred to Him was yet to come, but is viewed as past. This knowledge brings comfort, 1 Pet. iv. 12, 13. <h2><u><b>19.</b>]</u></h2> not only explains this hatred, but derives additional comfort from it, as a sign that they were not (any longer) <i>of the world</i> ; but chosen out of it by Him, and endued with a new life from above. <br><br>By the result being expressed in the words, <b>would love his</b> (its) <b>own</b>, not “<i>would love</i> <b>you</b>,” we have the true practice of the world hinted at, and the false character of the world’s love, as a mere <i>self-love</i>, set forth. In this ‘loving their own,’ the children of this world fall into hating one another. Meyer remarks the solemnity of <b>the world</b> thus repeated five times. <h2><u><b>20.</b>]</u></h2> Our Lord had said it to them in ch. xiii. 16, but with a different reference: the sense here being, ‘Remember the saying, for it is true in this matter also;’ see Matt. x. 24, where it is used in the same sense. <b>They</b>, i.e. <i>the world</i>—the persons constituting it. <br><br>A difficulty has been raised on the latter clause of this verse, because “<i>they</i>” did not im any sense “<i>keep</i>” Christ’s word, whereas they did persecute Him: and an attempt has been made to give to the word “<i>keep</i>” the sense of <i>watching</i> with a hostile intent, which it will not bear. Nor is<i> irony</i> (Lampe, Stier) in this latter clause at all in keeping with the solemnity of the discourse. There is no real difficulty : the words simply mean, ‘the keeping My word and the keeping yours are intimately joined, and when you find the world or any part of the world do the first, you may infer the other.” The issue of the condition, “<i>If they kept My saying</i>,” was to be proved by their rejection and killing of the Lord Jesus.<h2><u><b>21.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Howbeit</b> — stronger than merely<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12QJv-1lltJx6BM3UtduPY9nl9muGgYiq/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

See ch. ix. 41 and note.<br><br><b>If I had not come and spoken unto them,</b> i.e. <b>discoursed to them</b>, generally: not, <i>acquainted them with their sin</i>. The <i>sin</i> spoken of is, not the generally sinful state of the world,—nor the sin of unbelief in Christ, which they of course could not have committed, had He never come: but, <i>the sin of hatred to Him and His</i>, which might have been excused otherwise, but now that He had come and discoursed with them, had no excuse, since He had plainly shewn them the proofs of His mission from the Father. <br><br>Thus He shews that they embraced the side of evil of their own accord, and had no pretext of self-justification. <h2><u><b>23.</b>]</u></h2> See ch. xiv. 9. Human regards, whether of love or of hatred, towards Him who is the only manifestation of the Father to His creatures, are in fact directed towards the Father Himself; see Ps. lxix. 9, cited in Rom. xv. 3. <h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> He refers to the testimony of His <i>works</i> among them also, as leaving them again without excuse ;— they had had ocular witness of His mission.<h2><u><b>25.</b>]</u></h2> But all this not as an <i>accidental</i> thwarting of My word and work among them, but as a matter predicted in Seripture.<br><br><b>in their law</b>, ch. x. 34 and note. To suppose any irony in these words, as De Wette does (‘they are <i>true </i> <i>followers</i>-<i>out of their law’</i>), is manifestly against, the whole spirit of our Lord’s reference to the law. It is called ‘<i>their </i>law,’—“the law which they are ever turning over and vaunting themselves about,” as Bengel says,—as condemning them, though their boast and pride. <br><br><b>without a cause</b>, as answering to “<i>they have no excuse for their sin</i>,” ver, 22. <br><br>The citation is probably from Psalm lxix., which treats of the rejection and sufferings of the Messiah.<h2><u><b>26.</b>]</u></h2> This assurance carries on the testimony concerning Christ,—which the world should see and hear, and yet reject and hate Him,—even to the end of time, by means of the Spirit of Truth: so that on the one hand this<b> seeing and hating</b> must not be expected to cease as long as the Spirit bears this witness,—and on the other, He, the Spirit of Truth, will never cease to overcome the hating world by this His testimony. <h3><u><b>the Comforter</b> (<b>Paraclete</b>)]</u></h3> See ch. xiv. 16 and note.<h3><u><b>whom I will send</b>]</u></h3> Stier dwells on the accurate division of the clauses here, “<i> the Comforter</i> <b>whom I will send</b>,”—but “<i>the Spirit of Truth</i> <b>which proceedeth from the Father</b>.” The first clause he regards as spoken with reference to the mediatorial dispensation, of the Spirit in His office as Paraclete, sent from the Father by the glorified Son (or, by the Father in the<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 1, Part 2, John, Pages 206-254 missing.</h2><br><h1>Book: Acts</h1><br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 1, Part 2, Acts, Pages 255-308 missing.</h2><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YJ8ql9NUWbC25k_J34t_N30EjSgXebwP/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But here no sentence is recorded: and perhaps the very violence and fanatical character of the execution might constitute it, not an encroachment on the power of the Procurator, as it would have been if strictly in form of law, but a mere outbreak, and as such it might be allowed to pass unnoticed. That they observed the forms of <i>their own law</i>, in the place and manner of the stoning, is no objection to this view. <h3><u><b>the witnesses</b>]</u></h3> See Deut. xvii. 7, where it is enacted that the hands of the witnesses were to be first on the criminal to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people.<h3><u><b>they laid down their clothes</b>]</u></h3> They disencumbered themselves of their loose outer garments, that they might be light and unimpeded in the throwing of the stones. They laid them at Saul’s feet that he might keep them in safety. Such notices are deeply interesting, when we recollect by <i>whom</i> they were in all probability carefully inserted. See ch. xxii. 19, 20, and note on ch. xxvi. 10:—from which it appears that Saul can certainly not have been less than <i>thirty</i> at this time. He was a member of the Sanhedrim, and soon after was despatched on an important mission with their authority. <h2><u><b>59.</b>]</u></h2> All attempts to escape from this being a direct prayer to the Saviour are vain, as I have shewn in my Greek Testament. <h3><u><b>receive my spirit</b>]</u></h3> The same prayer in substance had been made by our Lord on the Cross (Luke xxiii. 46) to His Father. To <i>Him</i> was now committed the key of David. Similarly, the young man Saul, in after years: “<i>I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day</i>.” 2 Tim. i. 12. <h2><u><b>60.</b> <b>lay not this sin to their charge</b>]</u></h2> This again was somewhat similar (though not exactly, see note there) to our Lord’s prayer, Luke xxiii. 34.<h3><u><b>he fell asleep</b>]</u></h3> Not a Christian expression only: there are Jewish examples: and we have some even in Greek heathen poetry. But it became <i>the usual </i>Christian <i>term</i> for death. Its use here, when the circumstances, and the actors in them, are remembered, is singularly touching, from the contrast.<h1><u>CHAP.

Compare St. Paul’s own confession, ch. xxvi. 9—11. From this time, the narrative takes up Saul, and, at with considerable interruptions (ch. viii. x. xi. xii.), but after ch. xiii. 1 entirely, follows his history.<br><br><b>in that day</b>, can hardly mean, as some would render it, on <i>that very day</i>, viz. when Stephen was stoned.

But this latter reason is hardly applicable, after the command of our Lord ‘When they persecute you in one city, flee to another.” Matt. x. 23. Stier refers their remaining to an intimation of the Spirit, to stay and strengthen those who were left. Mr. Humphry cites an ancient tradition, mentioned by Clement of Alexandria, and by Eusebius from the Apocryphal work called the Preaching of Peter, that the Apostles were ordered by our Lord to remain at Jerusalem twelve years. But this could not be the case, as we have Peter and John going down to Samaria, ver. 14.<h2><u><b>2. devout men</b>]</u></h2> Whether Jews or Christians, is not certain. Ananias is so called, ch. xxii. 12, and he was a Christian. Olshausen thinks that, if they had been Christians the term <i>“brethren”</i> would have been used: but this does not seem by any means certain: we can hardly reason so minutely from the diction of one section in the narrative to that of another, especially in the case of a section so distinct and peculiar as this one. Besides, <i>“brethren”</i> in this very general sense does not occur till ch. ix. 30. Probably they were pious Jews, not yet converts, but hearers and admirers of Stephen. <h2><u><b>3. made havock of</b>]</u></h2> The word so rendered is properly used of wild beasts or of hostile armies, devastating and ravaging.<h2><u><b>4—12.</b>]</u></h2> PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL IN SAMARIA BY PHILIP. <h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> So then resumes the subject dropped at the end of ver. 1, and determines this verse to be the opening of a new section, not the close of the former. <h3><u><b>preaching the word</b>]</u></h3> Here first we become acquainted with the missionary language so frequent in the rest of the book: and we have the word, an abbreviated expression very familiar among Christians when the book was written, for the fuller one which must have prevailed at first, <i>“the word of God.”</i> <h2><u><b>5. Philip</b>]</u></h2> <i>The deacon:</i> not <i>one of the Twelve:</i> this is precluded by vv. 1 and 14. And it is probable, that the persecution should have been directed especially against the colleagues of Stephen. Philip is mentioned again as <i>the Evangelist</i>,—probably from his having been the first recorded who preached (<i>evangelized</i>) the word,—in ch. xxi. 8,—as married, and having four daughters, virgins, who prophesied.<h3><u><b>the city of Samaria</b>]</u></h3> Verbatim as John iv. 5, in which case it is specified as being Sychar (Sichem). As the words stand here, seeing that <i>Samaria</i> (vv. 9, 14; ch. ix. 31; xv. 3) signifies the <i>district</i>, I should be inclined to believe that Sychem is here also intended. It was a place of rising importance, and in after-times eclipsed the fame of its neighbour Samaria, which latter had been, on its presentation by Augustus to Herod the Great, re-fortified and called Sebaste.

Simon</b>]</u></h2> Neander, in the course of some excellent remarks on this whole history (see further on ver. 14), identifies, and I believe with reason, this Simon with one mentioned as living from ten to twenty years after this by Josephus, and as having been employed by the procurator Felix to tempt Drusilla to leave her husband, and live with him. Simon is there called “a Jew, born in Cyprus, and held to be a magician.” The only difficulty seems to be, that Simon is stated by Justin Martyr, himself a Samaritan, to have been “a Samaritan, from a village called Gitton.” But it has struck me that either Justin, or perhaps more probably Josephus, may have confounded Ghittim with Chittim, i.e. Citium in Cyprus. The account in Josephus is quite in character with what we here read of Simon: not inconsistent with ver. 24, which appears to have been uttered under terror occasioned by the solemn denunciation of Peter.—Justin goes on to relate that he was worshipped as a god at Rome in the time of Claudius Cæsar, on account of his magical powers, and had a statue on the island in the Tiber, inscribed ‘Simoni Deo Sancto’ (to Simon the Holy God). Singularly enough, in the year 1574, a stone was found in the Tiber (or <i>standing on the island in the year </i>1662, according to Smith’s Dictionary of Biography and Mythology), with the inscription SEMONI SANCO DEO FIDIO SACRUM, i.e. sacred to the god <i>Semo Sancus</i>, the Sabine Hereules;— which makes it probable that Justin may have been misled.—The history of Simon is full of legend and fable. He is said to have studied at Alexandria, and to have originally been, with the heresiarch Dositheus, a disciple of John the Baptist. Of Dositheus he became first the disciple, and then the successor. Origen makes Dositheus also a Samaritan, His own especial followers (Simoniani) had dwindled so much in the time of Origen, that he says there were at that day hardly thirty in the world. There are reports also of subsequent controversies between Simon Magus and Peter, of which the scene is laid at Cæsarea. According to some, he met with his death at Rome, having, during an encounter with Peter, raised himself into the air by the aid of evil spirits, and being precipitated thence at the prayer of Peter and Paul. I saw in the church of S. Francesca Romana, in the forum, a stone with two dents in it, and this inscription: “On this stone rested the knees of S. Peter, when the demons carried Simon Magus through the air.’—The fathers generally regard him as the founder of Gnosticism: this may be in some sense true: but, from the very little authentic information we possess, it is impossible to ascertain how far be was identified with their tenets. Origen distinctly denies that his followers were Christians in any sense. <h3><u><b>using sorcery</b>]</u></h3> viz. by exercising magic arts, such as then were very common in the East and found wide acceptance; impostors taking advantage of the very general expectation of a Deliverer at this time, to set themselves up by means of such trickeries as ‘some great ones.’ We have other examples in Elymas (ch. xiii.); Apollonius of Tyana; and somewhat later, Alexander of Abonoteichos; see these latter in Smith’s Dictionary of Biography and Mythology.<h3><u><b>some great one</b>]</u></h3> Probably not in such definite terms as his followers later are represented by Jerome as putting into his mouth: “I am the Word of God... I am the Paraclete, I am Almighty, I am all that is in God.” <h2><u><b>10. the great power of God</b>]</u></h2> Literally, according to the best MS. authorities, the power of God<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V8Z7EalKk8k0o15PMPtqw8289zsEo1eo/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But to this De Wette well replies, that we can hardly suppose the Alexandrine philosophy to have been so familiar to the mass of the people; and refers the expression to their popular belief of a <i>great angel</i>, who might, as the angels were called by the Samaritans the <i>powers of God</i>, be designated by these remarkable words. <h2><u><b>11.</b>]</u></h2> The rendering <i>“he had bewitched them”</i> is grammatically wrong. The word rendered <i>“bewitched”</i> (which is perhaps the best translation here) is <i>“amazed”</i> in Matt. xii. 23,—<i>“ astonished”</i> in Mark v. 42, Luke xxiv. 22 &c.<h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> “Simon saw his followers dropping off, and was himself astounded at the miracles wrought by Philip: he therefore thought it best himself also to acknowledge this superior power. He attached himself to Philip, and was baptized like the rest: but we are not, as the sequel shews, to understand that the preaching of the Gospel had made any impression on his heart, but that he accounted for what he saw in his own fashion. He was convinced, from the works which Philip did, that he was <i>in league with some powerful spirit:</i> he viewed baptism as the initiation into communion with that spirit, and expected that he should be able to make use of the higher power thus gained for his own purposes, and unite this new magical power to his own. All were baptized who professed belief in Jesus as the Messiah: there was therefore no reason for rejecting Simon, considering besides, that from the nature of the case he would for the time have given up his magical practices.” Neander. “It is plain,” says Calvin, “from this example of Simon, that the grace which is figured in Baptism is not conferred on all indifferently. It is a dogma of the Papists, that unless a man place the bar of mortal sin in the way, all receive, with the out- ward sign, the verity and effect of the Sacraments. Thus they attribute a magical force to the Sacraments, making them profitable without faith. But it is for us to know, that we are offered by God in the Sacraments whatever the promises annexed to them contain, and this in no empty words merely, provided we are led by faith to Christ, and seek from Him what the Sacraments promise. For though the reception of Baptism was of no profit to him, as the matter stood, yet if his conversion had followed afterwards, as some think it did, in that case its profit was not extinguished nor abolished. For it often happens that it is a long time before the Spirit of God works, and causes the Sacraments to begin to prove their efficacy.”<h2><u><b>14–25.</b>]</u></h2> MISSION OF PETER AND JOHN TO SAMARIA. A question arises on this procedure of the Apostles:—whether it was as a matter of course, that the newly baptized should, by the laying on of hands subsequently, receive the Holy Ghost,—or whether there was in the case of these Samaritans any thing peculiar, which caused the Apostles to go down to them and perform this act. (1) The only analogous case is ch. xix. 5, 6: in using which we must observe that there it is distinctly asserted that the <i>miraculous</i> gifts of the Spirit followed the laying on of Paul’s hands; and that by the expression <i>“when Simon </i><b>saw</b><i>”</i> in ver. 18, which must be taken literally, the same is implied here. And<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pNfrLPW0gADUGCrIEmOu_to8Hq_yLV7K/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 1, Part 2, Page 313:</a></h3><br>on this point the remarks of Calvin are too important to be omitted: “Here a question arises. He says that they were <i>only baptized</i> in the name of the Lord Jesus, and consequently were not yet partakers of the Spirit. But either Baptism has no virtue and grace at all; or it has whatever efficacy it possesses from the Holy Spirit. In Baptism we are washed from sins: but Paul shews that this washing is the work of the Holy Ghost (Tit. iii. 5). The water of Baptism is the symbol of Christ’s blood: but Peter says that it is the Spirit by whom we are washed in the blood of Christ. In Baptism our old man is crucified that we may be raised into newness of life (Rom. vi. 6): whence is all this but by sanctification of the Spirit? So that Baptism will have nothing left, if it be dissociated from the Spirit. Therefore it must not be denied, that the Samaritans, who had duly put on Christ in Baptism, had been also invested with the Spirit (Gal. iii. 27). And indeed Luke here speaks, not of the ordinary grace of the Spirit by which God regenerates us as sons to Himself, but of those special gifts with which it was the Lord’s will to endow some persons in the beginning of the Gospel for the furnishing of the Kingdom of Christ.” And a little after: “The Papists, in their wish to extol their fictitious Confirmation, do not hesitate to go even so far as to utter this sacrilegious diction, that those are only half Christians, on whom hands have not yet been laid. It is intolerable that they should have fixed on the Church as a perpetual law, what was a mere temporal symbol... for even they themselves are obliged to confess, that the Church was only for a time adorned with those gifts. Whence it follows that the imposition of hands which the Apostles here performed, came to an end when its effect ceased.” The English church, in retaining the rite of Confirmation, <i>has not grounded it on any institution by the Apostles</i>, but merely declared the laying on of hands on the candidates, to certify them (by this sign) of God’s favour and goodness towards them, to be <i>‘after the example of the holy Apostles.’</i> Nor is there any trace in the office, of the <i>conferring of the Holy Ghost</i> by confirmation; but a distinct recognition of the <i>former reception</i> of the Holy Spirit (at Baptism), and a prayer for the increase of His influence, proportioned to the maturer life now opening on the newly confirmed. (2) If then we have here <i>no institution of a perpetual ordinance,</i> something peculiar to the case before us must have prompted this journey. And here again we have a question: Was that moving cause in the Samaritans, or in Philip? I believe the true answer to the question will be found by combining both. Our Lord’s command (ch. i. 8) had removed all doubt as to Samaria being a legitimate field for preaching, and Samaritan converts being admissible. (So also with regard to Gentile converts,—see ch. x., notes: but, as the church at this time believed, they must be <i>circumcised</i>, which the Samaritan already were,—and <i>keep the law</i>, which after their manner the Samaritans did.) The sudden appearance, however, of a body of baptized believers in Samaria, by the agency of one who was <i>not one of the Apostles</i>,—while it would excite in them every feeling of thankfulness and joy, would require their presence and power, as Apostles, to perform their especial part as the divinely appointed Founders of the Church. Add to this, that the Samaritans appear to have been credulous, and easily moved to attach themselves to individuals, whether it were Simon, or Philip; which might make the Apostles desirous to be present in person, and examine, and strengthen their faith. Another reason may have been not without its influence: the Jewish church at Jerusalem would naturally for the most part be alienated in mind from this new body of believers. The hatred between Jews and Samaritans was excessive and unrelenting. It would therefore be in the highest degree important that it should be shewn to the church at Jerusalem, that these Samaritans, by the agency of the same Apostles, were partakers of the same visibly testified gifts of the one Spirit. The use of this argument, which was afterwards applied by Peter in the case of the Gentiles, unexpected even by himself, ch. xi. 17,—was probably no small part of the purpose of this journey to Samaria. <h2><u><b>14. Peter and John</b>]</u></h2> Perhaps <i>two</i>, in accordance with their having been sent out two and two on their first missionary journey (Mark vi. 7): so Paul and Barnabas afterwards (ch. xiii. 2): and the same principle seems to have been adhered to even when these last separated: Paul chose Silas, Barnabas took Mark.— PETER,—because to him belonged, in this early part of the gospel, in a remarkable manner, the first establishing of the church; it was the fulfilment of the promise <i>“upon this rock I will build my church.”</i> It was he who had (in common with all the Apostles, it is true, but in this early period more<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16c2xHrztCAVF_qKBh7RDWkGcfgQkNsSZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

So far, is plain truth of Scripture history. The monstrous fiction begins, when to Peter is attributed a fixed diocese and successors, and to those successors a delegated power more like that ascribed to Simon Magus than that promised to Peter. ——This is the last time that JOHN appears in the Acts. He is only once more mentioned in the New Testament (except in the Revelation), viz. as having been present in Jerusalem at Paul’s visit, Gal. ii. 9.<h2><u><b>15. prayed for them</b>]</u></h2> So laying on of hands is preceded by prayer, ch. vi. 6; xiii, 3. <h2><u><b>18. when Simon saw</b>]</u></h2> Its effects were therefore <i>visible</i> (see above), and consequently the effect of the laying on of the Apostles’ hands was not the <i>inward</i> but the <i>outward miraculous </i>gifts of the Spirit. <h3><u><b>he offered them money</b>]</u></h3> De Wette excellently remarks, ‘He regarded the capability of imparting the Holy Spirit, —<i>rightly, as something conferred</i>, as a <i>derived power</i> (see Matt. x. 1), but <i>wrongly</i>, as one to be obtained by an <i>external method</i>, without an <i>inward disposition:</i> and, since in external commerce every thing may be had for gold, <i>he wanted to buy it</i>. This is the essence of the sin of <i>Simony</i>, which is intimately connected with unbelief in the power and signification of the Spirit, and with materialism.’—Clearly, from the narrative, Simon himself <i>did not receive the Spirit by the laying on of hands</i>. His nefarious attempt to treat with the Apostles was <i>before he himself had been presented to them for this purpose</i>. <h2><u><b>20.</b>]</u></h2> The solemn denunciation of Peter, like the declaration of Paul, 1 Cor. vi. 13, has reference to the perishableness of all worldly good, and of those with it, whose chief end is the use of it (see Col. ii. 22). ‘Thy gold and thou are equally on the way to corruption:’ <i>thy gold</i>, as its nature is: <i>thou with it</i>, as having no higher life than thy natural corrupt one: as being bound in the <i>bond of iniquity</i>. The <i>expression of the same Peter</i>, 1 Pet. i. 7, <i>“gold that perisheth,”</i> is remarkably parallel with this (see too 1 Pet. i. 18). <h3><u><b>thou thoughtest</b>]</u></h3> not <i>‘thou hast thought’</i>, as A. V. The historic force of the tense is to be kept here: the Apostle uses it as looking forward to the day of his destruction, ‘Let thy lot be destruction, and that because thou thoughtest,’ &c. <br><br><b>to acquire</b>, not passive, as A. V., ungrammatically.<h2><u><b>21. neither part nor lot</b>]</u></h2> The two words are apparently synonymous: the first being literal, the second figurative, but not without reference perhaps to the <i>inheritance</i> of the kingdom of God, the <i>incorruptible inheritance</i>, 1 Pet. i. 4. <h3><u><b>this matter</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>the matter now spoken of</b>,—‘to which I now allude.’ <br><br><b>thy heart is not right</b>, —sincere, single-meaning,—<b>in God's presence</b>, ‘as God sees it:’ i.e. ‘seen as it really is, by God, is not in earnest in its<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yyak_vVy2DEFdWixB2shD7Zmyyiqpmbu/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Peter does not <i>pronounce</i> his sin <i>to have been such</i>, but throws in this doubt, to increase the motive to repent, and the earnestness of his repentance. This verse is important, taken in connexion with John xx. 23, as shewing <i>how completely the Apostles themselves referred the forgiveness of sins to, and left it in, the sovereign power of God, and not to their own delegated power of absolution.</i><h2><u><b>23.</b>]</u></h2> For gives the reason, not why it would be <i>difficult for forgiveness to take place, but why he had such extreme need of repentance and prayer,</i> as being tied and bound by the chain of sin. <h3><u><b>the gall of bitterness</b>]</u></h3> See Deut. xxix. 18; Lam. iii. 15,—‘the gall which is the very seat and essence of bitterness’—<b>a very gall of bitterness.</b> The poison of serpents was considered to be seated in their gall: so <i>“the gall of asps is within him,”</i> Job xx. 14.<h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> Simon speaks here much as Pharaoh, Exod. (viii. 28; ix. 28) x. 17, —who yet hardened his heart afterwards. It is observable also that he wishes merely for the <i>averting of the punishment.</i> The words, “that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me,” seem remarkably to set forth the mere terror of the carnal man, without any idea of the me becoming <i>another man</i> in thoughts and aims.<h2><u><b>25–40.</b>]</u></h2> Conversion of THE ÆTHI0PIAN EUNUCH BY PHILIP’S TEACHING.<h2><u><b>25.</b>]</u></h2> So then indicates (<i>see note on ver.</i> 4) that the paragraph should begin here, not at ver. 26 as commonly.<h3><u><b>villages of the Samaritans</b>]</u></h3> It is interesting to recall Luke ix. 52, where on their entering into a <i>village of the Samaritans</i>, <i>the same John</i> wishes to call down fire from heaven, and consume them. The gradual sowing of the seed further and further from Jerusalem is advancing: not only is this eunuch to carry it to a far distant land, but Philip is sent to a desert road, away from town or village, to seek him. The imperfect tenses, <i>“were returning &c.,”</i> are significant. They were on their way back to Jerusalem, and were evangelizing the Samaritan villages, when the angel spake to Philip. <h2><u><b>26.</b>]</u></h2> An angel, <i>visibly appearing:</i> not in a dream,—which is not, as some suppose, implied by the command to <i>arise</i>. The ministration of angels introduces and brings about several occurrences in the beginning of the church, see ch. v. 19; x. 3; xii. 7 (xxvii. 23). The appearance seems to have taken place in Samaria, after the departure of Peter and John. He would reach the place appointed by a shorter way than through Jerusalem: he would probably follow the high road (of the itineraries, see map in Conybeare and Howson’s St. Paul) as far as Gophna, and thence strike across the country south-westward to join, at some point to which he would be guided, the road leading from Jerusalem to Gaza.<h3><u><b>GAZA</b>]</u></h3> The southernmost<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZlGQ9Q0405iQfs112NuyOWWPqDvIk8da/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In Jer. xlvii. 1, we have ‘before Pharaoh (Necho?) smote Gaza,’—implying that at one time it was under Egypt. Alexander the Great took it after a siege of five months, but did not destroy it, for we find it a strong place in the subsequent Syrian wars, see 1 Macc. ix. 52; xi. 61 f.; xiii. 43; xiv. 7; xv. 28; xvi. 1.—It was destroyed by the Jewish king Alexander Jannæns (96 A.C.), after a siege of a year, but rebuilt again by the Roman general Gabinius,—afterwards given by Augustus to Herod, and finally after his death attached to the province of Syria, Mela, in the time of Claudius, calls it ‘a vast city, and strongly fortified,’ with which agree Eusebius and Jerome. At present it is a large town by the same name, with from 15,000 to 16,000 inhabitants. The above chronological notices shew that it cannot have been <i>“desert”</i> at this time: see below. <h3><u><b>this is desert</b>]</u></h3> The words, I believe, of the <i>angel</i>, not of St. Luke. There appear to have been two (if not more) ways from Jerusalem to Gaza. But Robinson found, besides, an ancient road leading <i>direct</i> from Jerusalem to Gaza, through the <i>Wadi Musurr</i>, and over the Beit Jiibrin, which certainly <i>at present</i> is <i>“desert,”</i> without towns or villages. Thus the words will refer to the <i>way:</i> and denote, <b>the way of which I speak to thee is desert</b>. See in my Greek Test. further proofs of the inapplicability of the epithet <i>“desert”</i> to Gaza. <h2><u><b>27. an eunuch</b>]</u></h2> The very general use of eunuchs in the East for filling offices of confidence, and the fact that this man was minister to a female sovereign, makes it probable that he was literally an eunuch. If not so, the word would hardly have been expressed. No difficulty arises from Deut. xxiii. 1, for no inference can be drawn from the history further than that he may have been a proselyte of the gate, in whose case the prohibition would not apply.—Nay, the whole occurrence seems to have had one design, connected with this fact. The walls of partition were one after another being thrown down: the Samaritans were already in full possession of the Gospel: it was next to be shewn that none of those physical incapacities which excluded from the congregation of the Lord under the old covenant, formed any bar to Christian baptism and the inheritance among believers; and thus the way gradually to be paved for the great and as yet incomprehensible truth of Gal. iii. 28.<h3><u><b>Candace</b> (pronounced Candăcé, not Candācé)]</u></h3> As <i>Pharaoh</i> among the Egyptians was the customary name of kings, so Candăcé of the queens among the Æthiopians in upper Egypt, who dwelt in the island of Meroe, where Pliny relates that a queen reigned named Candace, and adds, “which name has now for many years passed from one queen to another.”<h3><u><b>had come to Jerusalem for to worship</b>…]</u></h3> This did not only Jews and proselytes, but also those pious Gentiles who adhered to Judaism,—the proselytes of the gate, see John xii. 20. Eusebius, taking for granted that this eunuch was a Gentile, calls him “the firstfruits of the Gentiles throughout the world.” There were (see below, ch. xi. 21) cases of Gentile conversion before that of Cornelius; and the stress of the narrative in ch. x. consists in the miscellaneous admission of all the Gentile company of Cornelius, and their official reception into the church by that Apostle to whom was especially given the power. We may remark, that if even the plain revelation by which the reception of Cornelius and his company was commanded failed finally to convince Peter, so that long after this he vacillated (Gal. ii. 11, 12), it is no argument for the eunuch not being a Gentile, that his conversion and baptism did not remove the prejudices of the Jewish Christians. <h2><u><b>28. read Esaias</b>]</u></h2> aloud, see next ver.

But the Hebrew does not seem to bear this out.<h2><u><b>34. answered</b>]</u></h2> <i>to the passage of Scripture</i>, considered as the question proposed: not, to the question in ver. 30.

It is said to be near a place named Bethsur. Eusebius states it to be twenty miles south of Jerusalem in the direction of Hebron: and so it is set down in the ancient itineraries. Pocock found there a fountain built over, and a village called Betur on the left. Fabri describes the fountain as the head of a considerable brook, and found near it the ruins of a Christian church. There is no improbability in the tradition, except that, even supposing a way going across from Hebron straight to Gaza to be called <i>desert</i>, this would not be on that portion of it, but on the high road. <h3><u><b>what doth hinder me to be baptized?</b>]</u></h3> There is no reason for supposing Philip to have preached to him the necessity of baptism: his own acquaintance with Jewish practices, and perhaps his knowledge of the progress of the new faith in Jerusalem, would account for the proposition.<br><br><b>37.</b>) The authorities against this verse are too strong to permit its insertion.

This insertion is found as early as Irenæus (Century II.), who quotes it. It appears to have been made to suit the formularies of the baptismal liturgies, it being considered strange that the eunuch should have been baptized without some such confession. <h2><u><b>38.</b> <b>he</b> (viz. the eunuch) <b>commanded</b>]</u></h2> Some of our MSS., whose text apparently Jerome followed, read here, ‘<i>the Spirit fell on the eunuch, and an angel of the Lord caught away Philip</i>.” This is curious, and has probably arisen from a desire to conform the results of the eunuch’s baptism to the usual method of the divine procedure, and the snatching away of Philip to his commission, ver. 26. But the Spirit did not fall on the Samaritans after baptism by Philip.—The text clearly relates a supernatural disappearance of Philip: compare 2 Kings ii. 16; no interpretation of his being suddenly hurried away by the prompting of the Spirit, will satisfy the analogy of the above-cited passage, and of (see below) a parallel one in St. Luke’s own Gospel. <h2><u><b>39. saw him no more</b>]</u></h2> Not ‘never saw him from that day,’ though (see below) that meaning may be indirectly included :—but as in Luke xxiv. 31, “<i>He vanished from their sight,</i>” and as in the strictly parallel words of 2 Kings ii. 12, “<i>he saw him no more</i>,”—after the going up of Elijah. These last words in my view decide the question, that the departure of Philip was miraculous. <h3><u><b>for he went on his way</b>]</u></h3> This refers to <i>what follows:</i>— Philip was found at Azotus: if the eunuch had gone <i>that way</i>, he might have met with him again: but he did not, for he went from the fountain <i>on his own way</i>, which did not lead through Azotus. There has been some strange inadvertence in this verse on the part of the translators of the A. V. The Greek has plainly, <b>and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing:</b> and there is no variety of reading. <h2><u><b>40.</b>]</u></h2> The term “<i>was found</i>” again appears to refer to 4 Kings ii. ver. 17.—AZOTUS or ASHDOD (Josh. xiii. 3; 1 Sam. v. 5 al.) was one of the five principal cities of the Philistines, never, though nominally in Judah, thoroughly subjugated by the Jews: it was taken by Tartan the Assyrian general (Isa. xx. 1),—again by Psammetichus, Jer. xxv. 20,—again by Judas Maccabæus (1 Macc. v. 68) and Jonathan (1 Macc. x. 84), and the latter destroyed;—rebuilt by Gabinius, and belonged to the kingdom of Herod, who left it in his will to his sister Salome. At present it is a small village, retaining the name Esdud, but there are no remains. <h3><u><b>all the cities</b>]</u></h3> viz.

We read of it in Abraham’s time (Gen. xiv. 15; xv. 2): then no more till David subdued it (2 Sam. viii. 6); it became independent again under Solomon (1 Kings xi. 24 ff.), and from that time was the residence of the kings of Syria (1 Kings xv. 18; xx. 1 ff.), who were long at war with Israel and Judah, and at last were permitted to prevail considerably over Israel (2 Kings x. 32; Amos i. 3, 4) and to exact tribute from Judah (2 Kings xii. 17, 18, see also 2 Kings xiii. 3, 22, 25). Damascus was recovered to Israel by Jeroboam II. (about 825 A.C. 2 Kings xiv. 28). Not long after we find Rezin, king of Syria, in league with Pekah, king of Israel, against Ahaz (2 Kings xv. 37). Ahaz invited to his assistance Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, who took Damascus and slew Rezin, and led the people captive (2 Kings xvi. 5–9; Isa. viii. 4). From this time we find it subject to Assyria (Isa. ix. 11; x. 9; xvii. 1), then to Babylon (2 Kings xxiv. 2; Jer. xxxv. 11),—Persia, the Syrian Seleucidæ (1 Macc. xi. 62; xii. 32),—and from the time of Pompey (64 A.C.), to the Romans, and attached to the province of Syria. Many Jews were settled there, and the majority of the wives of the citizens were proselytes.—On its subjection to Aretas, see below, ver. 24, note. It was later the residence of the Ommiad Caliphs, and the metropolis of the Mahommedan world. At present it is a large city, with 250,000 inhabitants, nearly 70,000 of whom are Christians.—It is situated most beautifully, in a large and well-watered plain, on the river Chrysorrhoas (Barrada), which divides into many streams (see 2 Kings v. 12), and fertilizes the plain:—and is bounded on all sides by the desert. See a vivid description of Damascus in Conybeare and Howson’s Life of St. Paul, vol. i. pp. 104–108. <h3><u><b>to the synagogues</b>]</u></h3> i.e. to the <i>presidents</i> of the synagogues, who would acknowledge the orders of the Sanhedrim, and could, under the authority of the Ethnarch, carry them out. <h3><u><b>of the way</b>]</u></h3> Not ‘of this way,’ A. V., which rendering should be kept for the places where the pronoun is <i>expressed</i>, as ch. xxii. 4,— but <b>of the way</b>, viz. of ‘salvation,’ ch. xvi. 17, or ‘of the Lord,’ ch. xviii. 25. The expression ‘THE WAY’ had evidently become a well-known one among Christians (see in this edition ch. xix. 9, 23; xxii. 4; xxiv. 14, 22); and it only was necessary to prefix the pronoun when <i>strangers</i> were addressed.—The special journey to Damascus presupposes the existence of Christians there, and in some numbers. This would be accounted for by the return of many who may have been converted at the Pentecostal effusion of the Spirit, and perhaps also by some of the fugitives from the persecution having settled there. This latter is rendered probable by Ananias’s words, “<i>I have heard </i><b>from many</b><i> of this man,</i>” ver. 13. <h2><u><b>3.</b>]</u></h2> The journey from Jerusalem was probably made on the Roman road, i.e. that of the Itineraries, by Neapolis (Sichem) and Scythopolis, crossing the Jordan, south of the lake Tiberias,—Gadara, and so to Damascus. Or he might have joined,— either the Petra road, by Jericho and Heshbon, and so by Botsrah to Damascus,—or the Egyptian caravan-track, which passes to the north of the lake of Tiberias, and near Cæsarea Philippi. In either case the journey would occupy from five to six days, the distance being 130 to 150 miles.<h3><u><b>there shined round about him...</b>]</u></h3> It was (ch. xxii. 6) <i>about noonday</i>; and from ch. xxvi. 13, the light was <i>above the brightness of the sun</i>. These details at once cut away all ground from the absurd rationalistic attempt to explain away the appearance as having been <i>lightning</i>. Unquestionably, the inference is, that it was a bright noon, and the full splendour of the Oriental sun was shining.—His companions saw the light, and were also cast to the ground, ch. xxvi. 13, 14; xxii. 9: see below on ver. 7. <h2><u><b>4. a voice saying unto him</b>]</u></h2><i> in the Hebrew language</i>, ch. xxvi. 14. <h3><u><b>why persecutest thou me?</b>]</u></h3> A remarkable illustration of Matt. xxv. 45.

These last I unhesitatingly refer to this occasion, and not to any subsequent one, when he saw the Lord <i>in a trance</i>, ch. xxii. 17. Such appearances could hardly form the subject of the testimony of an eyewitness which should rank with that of the other apostles: this, on the contrary, was no <i>trance</i>, but the <i>real bodily appearance of the risen Jesus;</i> so that it might be adduced as the ground of testimony to His Resurrection.—On the words excluded from our text, as having been interpolated from ch. xxvi. 14, and xxii. 10, see note at xxvi. 14. It is natural that the account of the <i>historian</i> should be less precise than that of the <i>person concerned, relating his own history.</i> In ch. xxvi. 15–18, very much more is related to have been said by the Lord: but perhaps he there, as he omits the subsequent particulars, includes the revelations made to him during the three days, and in the message of Ananias.<h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> In ch. xxii. 9, we read, “<i>They that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid: but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</i>” Two accounts seemingly (and certainly, in the <i>letter</i>) discrepant; but exceedingly instructive when their <i>spirit</i> is compared,—the fact being this: that the companions of Saul saw and were struck to the ground by the light, but saw <i>no person</i>:—that they stood (I should acknowledge the discrepancy here, and recognize the more accurate detail of ch. xxvi. 14, that they <i>fell</i> <i>to the ground</i>) mute, hearing the sound of the voice, but not the words spoken and their meaning. Compare John xii. 29, note. Two classes of readers only will stumble at this difference of the forms of narration; those who from enmity to the faith are striving to create or magnify discrepancies,—and those who, by the suicidal theory of verbal inspiration, are effectually doing the work of the former. The devout and intelligent student of Scripture will see in such examples a convincing proof of the simple truth of the narrative,—the absence of all endeavour to pare aware apparent inconsistencies or revise them into conformity,—the <i>bonâ fide</i> work of holy truthful men, bearing each his testimony to things seen and heard under the guidance, not of the spirit of bondage, but of that Spirit of whom it is said, “<i>where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty</i>.’— I should not too hastily determine that this account <i>has not come from Saul himself</i>, on account of the above differences: they are no more than might arise in narrations at different times by the same person. <h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> <b>When his eyes were opened </b>(it would seem that he had closed them on the first disappearance of the vision)<b>, he saw no one.</b> He explains it, ch. xxii. 11, “<i>when I could not see for the glory of that light.</i>” He had seen, what those with him had not seen, the glorious Person of the Lord Jesus. See below on ver. 18.<h2><u><b>9. he neither did eat nor drink</b>]</u></h2> There is no occasion to soften these words; the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KCsYyasVC-6_aLwi0n2XtB_4AjY8Byx1/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In ch. xxvi., speaking before the Roman governor, <i>he does not mention him</i>. —Mr. Howson remarks on the close analogy between the divine procedure by visions here, and in ch. x. Here, Ananias is prepared for his work, and Saul for the reception of him as a messenger, each by a vision: and similarly Peter and Cornelius in ch, x. I may add, that in ch. viii., where the preparation of heart was already found in the eunuch, <i>Philip only</i> was supernaturally prepared for the interview.<h2><u><b>11.</b>]</u></h2> “We are allowed to bear in mind that the thoroughfares of Eastern cities do not change, and to believe that the ‘straight street,’ which still extends through Damascus in long perspective from the eastern gate, is the street where Ananias spoke to Saul.” (Conybeare and Howson, p. 115.)<h3><u><b>the house of Juda</b>s]</u></h3> The houses of Ananias and Judas are still shewn to travellers. Doubtless they (or at least the former) would long be remembered and pointed out by Christians; but, in the long degradation of Christianity in the East, most of such identities must have been lost; and imposture is so easy, that it is hardly possible to cherish the thought that the spots now pointed out can be the true ones. And so of all cases, where we have not unalterable or unaltered data to go on. Still, true as this is, we have sometimes proofs and illustrations unexpectedly appearing, as research goes on, which identify as authentic, sites long pointed out by tradition. So that our way seems to be, to seek for all such elucidations, and meantime to suspend our judgment: but never to lose sight of, nor to treat contemptuously at first sight, a local belief. <h3><u><b>of Tarsus</b>]</u></h3> The first place where he is so specified.— TARSUS was the capital of the province of Cilicia, a large and populous city in a fruitful plain on the river Cydnus, which flowed through the midst of it, with a swift stream of remarkably cold water. Strabo speaks most highly of its eminence in schools of philosophy; and says that they excelled those even of Athens and Alexandria. He enumerates many learned men who had sprung from it. It was a “<i>free city</i>,” i.e. one which, though under Rome, lived under its own laws and chose its own magistrates. This <i>freedom</i> was granted to it by Antony: and much later we find it a Roman <i>colony</i>. It is now a town with about 20,000 inhabitants, and is described as being a den of poverty, filth, and ruins. There are many remains of the old town.<h3><u><b>behold, he prayeth</b>]</u></h3> This word would set before Ananias, more powerfully than any other, the state of Saul.<h2><u><b>12. a man named Ananias</b>]</u></h2> A man, whose name in the same vision he knew to be Ananias. The sight of the man and the knowledge of his name were both granted him in his vision. <h2><u><b>13. thy saints</b>]</u></h2> This is the first time that this afterwards well-known appellation occurs as applied to the believers in Christ. <h2><u><b>14.</b>]</u></h2> It could hardly fail to have been notified to the Christians at Damascus by their brethren at Jerusalem, that Saul was on his<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q7dmzlaYu1NoDv521ZGEZXyC-yUdnhFJ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This would hardly he understood at the time: it was afterwards on a remarkable occasion repeated to Paul by the Lord in a vision (see ch. xxii. 21), and was regarded by him as the specific command which gave the direction to his ministry, see Gal. ii. 7, 8. <h3><u><b>kings</b>]</u></h3> Agrippa, and probably Nero. <h2><u><b>16. I will shew him...</b>]</u></h2> The fulfilment of this is testified by Paul himself, ch. xx. 23, 25: see also xxi. 11.<h2><u><b>17. and he filled with the Holy Ghost</b>]</u></h2> I ean hardly think that these words imply that the Lord had said to Ananias more than is above related: I would rather view them as a natural inference from what was said in ver. 15.—In ch. xxii. 14, where the command to Ananias is omitted, <i>his</i> speech contains much of the reason given in the command here. It is remarkable again how Paul, speaking there to an infuriated Jewish mob, gives the words spoken just that form which would best gain him a favourable hearing with them,—for example, “<i>the God of our fathers,</i>”—“<i>to see that Just One</i>,” “<i>all men</i>,” avoiding as yet the hateful word “<i>Gentiles</i>.” He there too gives, “<i>Arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling upon the name of the Lord,</i>” as part of the exhortation of Ananias. <h2><u><b>18. as it had been scales</b>]</u></h2> The recovery of sight is plainly related as miraculous, the consequence of the divinely-appointed laying on of the hands of Ananias. And this scaly substance which fell from his eyes was thrown off in the process of the instantaneous healing. <h3><u><b>was baptized</b>]</u></h3> It has been well remarked by Olshausen, that great honour was here placed upon the sacrament of baptism, inasmuch as not even Saul, who had seen the Lord in special revelation and was an elect vessel, was permitted to dispense with this, the Lord’s appointed way of admission into His Church.<h2><u><b>19. certain days</b>]</u></h2> A few days; of quiet, and becoming acquainted with those as brethren, whom he came to persecute as infidels: but not to learn from them the gospel (for this he did not receive from man, neither was he taught it, Gal i. 12), nor was the time longer than to admit of <b>straightway</b> being used, ver. 20,—and indeed the same word is used of the whole space (including his <i>preaching</i> in our vv. 20, 21) preceding the journey to Arabia, in Gal. i. 16. See below. <h2><u><b>20. he preached Jesus</b>]</u></h2> The alteration to “<i>Christ</i>” has probably, as Meyer suggests, been made from doctrinal considerations, to fix on “<b>the Son of God</b>” the theological sense,—<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_YFRVgrTKf50EYLqcHtbrTtenkoir3hb/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Paul mentions this journey (Gal. i. 17) with no obscure hint that to it was to be assigned the reception by him, in full measure, of the Gospel which he preached. And such a reception would certainly give rise to the great accession of power here recorded. I am the more disposed to allot that journey this place, from the following considerations. The omission of any mention of it here can arise only from one of two causes: (1) whether Paul himself were the source of the narrative, or some other narrator,— <i>the intentional passing over of it, as belonging more to his personal history</i> (which it was his express purpose to relate in Gal. i.) <i>than to that of his ministry:</i> (2) on the supposition of Paul not having been the source of the narrative,—<i>the narrator having not been aware of it</i>. In either case, this expression seems to me one very likely to have been used:—(1) if the omis- sion was <i>intentional</i>,—to record a remarkable accession of power to Saul’s ministry, without particularizing whence or how it came: (2) if it was <i>unintentional</i>,—as a simple record of that which was observed in him, but of which the course was to the narrator unknown. <h3><u><b>confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus</b>]</u></h3> Chrysostom strikingly says, “Being learned in their law, he stopped their mouths and suffered them not to speak: they thought that they had got rid of such arguments in getting rid of Stephen, and behold they found another arguer more powerful than Stephen.”<h2><u><b>23. many days</b>]</u></h2> <i>In</i> Damascus, see above on ver. 19. The whole time, from his conversion to his journey to Jerusalem, was three years, Gal. i. 18. <h3><u><b>took counsel to kill him</b>]</u></h3> “The Jews again have recourse to the logic of force. They no longer seek for suborned men, and false accusers and false witnesses.” Chrysostom.<h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> In 2 Cor. xi. 32, St. Paul writes, “<i>In Damascus the governor under Arĕtas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me.</i>” A somewhat difficult chronological question arises respecting the subordination of Damascus to this Arĕtas. The city, under Augustus and Tiberius, was attached to the province of Syria: and we have coins of Damascus of both these emperors, and again of Nero and his successors. But we have none of Caligula and Claudius; and the following circumstances seem to point to a change in the rulership of Damascus at the death of Tiberius. There had been for some time war between Aretas, king of Arabia Nabatæa (whose capital was Petra), and Herod Antipas, on account of the divorce by Herod of Aretas’ daughter at the instance of Herodias, and on account of some disputes about their frontiers. A battle was fought, and Herod’s army entirely destroyed. On this Antipas, who was a favourite with Tiberius, sent to Rome for help: and Vitellius, the governor of Syria, was commissioned to march against Aretas, and take him, dead or alive. While on his march, he heard at Jerusalem of the death of Tiberius (March 16, A.D. 37), and no longer being able to carry out his intended war, on account of the change of the supreme power from Tiberius to Caligula, abandoned his march, and sent<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDY44jNIX9tu7sOyhU-N8V7m5mbU56og/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This change of the supreme power brought about a great change in the situation of Antipas and his enemy. Antipas was soon (A.D. 39) banished to Lyons, and his kingdom given to Agrippa, his foe (Antt. xviii. 7. 2), who had been living in habits of intimacy with the new emperor. It would be natural that Aretas, who had been grossly injured by Antipas, should by this change of affairs, be received into favour; and the more so, as there was an old grudge between Vitellius and Antipas, of which Josephus says, he concealed his anger until the reign of Caligula, when he followed it up. Now in the year 38 Caligula made several changes in the East, granting Ituræa to Soæmus, Lesser Armenia and parts of Arabia to Cotys, the territory of Cotys to Rhæmetalces,—and to Polemon, the son of Polemon, his father’s government. These facts, coupled with that of no Damascene coins of Caligula and Claudius existing (which might he fortuitous, but acquires force when thus combined), make it probable that about this time Damascus, which belonged to the predecessors of Aretas, was granted to Aretas by Caligula. This would at once solve the difficulty. The other suppositions,—that the Ethnarch was only visiting the city (as if he could then have guarded the city to prevent Paul’s escape),—or that Aretas had seized Damascus on Vitellius giving up the expedition against him (as if a Roman governor of a province would, while waiting for orders from a new emperor, quietly allow one of its chief cities to be taken from him),—are in the highest degree<br><br>improbable. <h2><u><b>25.</b>]</u></h2> Further particularized by the addition of “<i>through a window,</i>” 2 Cor. xi, 33. Such windows in the walls of cities are common in the East: see Josh. ii. 15: and an engraving of part of the present wall of Damascus in Conybeare and Howson’s Life of St. Paul, i. p. 124.<h3><u><b>in a basket</b>]</u></h3> The word here is the same as in Matt. xv. 37, where see note. <h2><u><b>26.</b>]</u></h2> He went to Jerusalem <i>immediately</i>: the purpose of this journey was to become acquainted with Peter, Gal. i. 18: a resolution probably taken during the conspiracy of the Jews against him at Damascus, and in furtherance of his announced mission to the Gentiles: that, by conference with the Apostles, his sphere of work might be agreed on. And this purpose his escape enabled him to effect. <h2><u><b>27.</b>]</u></h2> It is very probable that Barnabas and Saul may have been personally known to each other in youth. “Cyprus is only a few hours’ sail from Cilicia. The schools of Tarsus may naturally have attracted one who, though a Levite, was a Hellenist: and there the friendship may have begun, which lasted through many vicissitudes, till it was rudely interrupted in the dispute at Antioch (ch. xv. 39).” Conybeare and Howson, edn. 2, i. p. 127. <h3><u><b>brought him to the apostles</b>]</u></h3> Only to Peter and James the Lord’s brother, Gal. i. 18, 19. Probably there were no other Apostles there at the time: if there were, it is hardly conceivable that Saul should not have seen them. On his second visit, he saw John also (Gal. ii. 9). Perhaps he never saw in the flesh any other of the Apostles after his conversion.<h2><u><b>29. the Grecian Jews</b>]</u></h2> See ch. vi. 1 and note.

Which when the brethren knew....</b>]</u></h2> There was also another reason. He was praying in the temple, and saw the Lord in a vision, who commanded him to depart, for they would not receive his testimony: —and sent him from thence to the Gentiles: see ch. xxii, 17–21 and notes. His stay in Jerusalem at this visit was fifteen days, Gal. i. 18.<h3><u><b>to Cæsarea</b>]</u></h3> From the whole cast of the sentence, and the words <b>brought him down</b> and <b>sent him forth</b>, we should infer this to be Cæsarea Stratonis (see on ch. x. 1), even if this were not determined by the word <i>Cæsarea</i> used absolutely, which always applies to this city, and not to Cæsarea Philippi (which some believe to be meant: see Matt. xvi. 13 and note). From Gal. i. 21, it would appear that Saul about this time <i>traversed Syria </i>(on his way to Tarsus?). If so, he probably went by sea to Seleucia, and thence to Antioch. The expression <b>sent him forth</b>, looks more like a ‘sending off’ by sea, than a mere ‘sending forward’ by land. They sent him <b>towards</b>, ‘for,’ Tarsus. He was not idle there, but certainly preached the Gospel, and in all probability was the founder of the churches alluded to ch. xv. 23 and 41.<h2><u><b>31.</b>]</u></h2> FLOURIsHING STATE OF THE CHURCH IN PALESTINE AT THIS TIME. Commencement of new section: compare note, ch. xi. 19. The reading <b>church</b>, instead of “<i>churches</i>,” can hardly (as Meyer) be an alteration to suit the idea of <i>the unity of the church</i>,—as in that case we should have similar alterations in ch. xv. 41; xvi. 5, where <i>no variations are found in the chief MSS.</i> More probably, it has been altered here to conform it to those places. This description probably embraces most of the time since the conversion of Saul. De Wette observes, that the attention of the Jews was, during much of this time, distracted from the Christians, by the attempt of Caligula to set up his image in the temple at Jerusalem, related by Josephus. <br><br><b>being built up</b>, or <i>edified</i>: see Matt. xvi. 18. It probably refers to both external and internal strength and accession of grace. St. Paul commonly uses it of <i>spiritual</i> building up: see 1 Cor. viii, 1; x. 23; xiv. 4, 17; 1 Thess. v. 11. <h3><u><b>and was multiplied by the exhortation of </b>(i.e. inspired by) <b>the Holy Spirit</b>]</u></h3> This is the only rendering which suits the usage of the words. See on the others which have been given, in my Greek Testament.<h2><u><b>32–35.</b>]</u></h2> HEALING OF ÆNEAS AT LYDDA BY PETER. This and the following miracle form the introduction to the very important portion of Peter’s history which follows in ch. x.,—by bringing him and his work before us again.<h2><u><b>32. as Peter passed throughout all....</b>]</u></h2> These words are aptly introduced by the notice in ver. 31, which shews that Peter’s journey was not an escape from persecution, but undertaken at a time of peace, and for the purpose of visiting the churches.— The word <b>all</b>, to which no substantive is supplied in the original, may be neuter, ‘all parts:’ but it is probably masculine, and “all the saints” or “all the brethren ” are understood.

It seems most likely that it was <i>before his arrival.</i> For (1) it is St. Luke’s manner in this first part of the Acts, where he is carrying on several histories together, to follow the one in hand as far as some resting-point, and then go back and take up another: see ch. viii. 2 thus taken up from ver. 1: ver. 4 going back to the dispersion:—ch. ix. 1 taken up from viii. 3:—xi. 19, from viii. 4 again:—and (2) the journey of Peter to visit the churches which were now resting after the persecution would hardly be delayed so long as three whole years. So that it is most natural to place this section, viz. ch. ix. 32–xi. 18 (for all this is continuous), <i>before the visit of Saul to Jerusalem,</i> and during his stay at Damascus or in Arabia. See further on xi. 19.<h3><u><b>Lydda</b>]</u></h3> Called <i>Lod</i>, Neh. vii. 37.— A large village near Joppa (ver. 38), on the Mediterranean, just one day’s journey from Jerusalem. It afterwards became the important town of Diospolis. <h2><u><b>33. Ænĕas</b>]</u></h2> Whether a believer or not, does not appear; from Peter’s visit being to the <i>saints</i>, it would seem that he was: but perhaps the indefinite term, <b>a certain man</b>, may imply the contrary, as also Peter’s words, announcing a free and unexpected gift from One whom he knew not. <h2><u><b>35. all that dwelt in L. and S. saw him;—which also</b> (this is the literal rendering, and is equivalent to and they) <b>turned to the Lord</b>]</u></h2> A general conversion of the inhabitants to the faith followed. <h3><u><b>Saron</b>]</u></h3> Perhaps not a village, but the celebrated plain of that name [Sharon], extending along the coast from Cæsarea to Joppa, see Isa. xxxiii, 9; xxxv.2; lxv. 10; Cant. ii. 1; 1 Chron. xxvii. 29. Mariti mentions a village Saren between Lydda and Arsuf (see Josh. xii. 18, marg. A. V.): but more recent travellers do not notice it.<h2><u><b>36–43.</b>]</u></h2> RAISING OF TABITHA FROM THE DEAD. <h2><u><b>36. at Joppa</b>]</u></h2> Joppa was a very ancient Philistian city, on the frontier of Dan, but not belonging to that tribe, Josh. xix. 46; on the coast (ch. x. 6), with a celebrated but not very secure harbour: (see 2 Chron. ii. 16; Ezra iii. 7; Jonah i. 3; 1 Macc. xiv. 5; 2 Macc. xii. 8)—situated in a plain (1 Macc. x. 75 –77) near Lydda (ver. 38), at the end of the mountain road connecting Jerusalem with the sea. The Maccabean generals, Jonathan and Simon, took it from the Syrians and fortified it (1 Macc. x. 74—76; xiv. 5, 34). Pompey joined it to the province of Syria, but Caesar restored it to Hyrcanus, and it afterwards formed part of the kingdom of Herod and of Archelaus, after whose deposition it reverted to the province of Syria, to which it belonged at the time of our narrative. It was destroyed by Caius Cestius ; but rebuilt, and became a nest of Jewish pirates, in consequence of which Vespasian levelled it with the ground, and built a fort there, which soon became the nucleus of a new town. It is now called Jaffa, and has about 7000 inhabitants, half of whom are Christians. <h3><u><b>Tabitha</b>]</u></h3> This name, in Aramaic, answers to Dorcas, in Greek, signifying a <i>gazelle</i>. It appears also in the Rabbinical books as a female name: the gazelle being in the East a favourite type of beauty. See Song of Sol. ii. 9, 17; iv. 5; vii. 3.

In this case it would shew, as De Wette observes, that the <i>stricter</i> Jewish practices were already disregarded by the Apostle. It also would shew, in how little honour he and his office were held by the Jews at Caesarea.<h1><u>CHAP. X.<b> 1–48.</b>]</u></h1> CONVERSION (BY SPECIAL DIVINE PREARRANGEMENT) AND BAPTISM OF THE GENTILE CORNELIUS AND HIS PARTY. We may remark, that the conversion of the Gentiles was <i>no new idea </i>to Jews or Christians, but that it had been universally regarded as to take place by <i>their reception into Judaism.</i> Of late, however, since the Ascension, we see the truth that the Gospel was to be a Gospel of the <i>uncircumcision</i>, beginning to be recognized by some. Stephen, carrying out the principles of his own apology, could hardly have failed to recognize it: and the Cyprian and Cyrenæan missionaries of ch. xi. 20 preached the word <i>to the Grecians </i>(not the <i>Grecian Jews</i>) <i>certainly before the conversion of Cornelius.</i> This state of things might have given rise to a permanent schism in the infant church. The Hellenists, and perhaps Saul, with his definite mission to the Gentiles, might have formed one party, and the Hebrews, with Peter at their head, the other. But, as Neander admirably observes, ‘The pernicious influence with which, from the first, the self-seeking and one-sided prejudices of human nature threatened the divine work, was counteracted by the superior influence of the Holy Spirit, which did not allow the differences of men to reach such a point of antagonism, but enabled them to retain unity in variety. We recognize the preventing wisdom of God,—which, while giving scope to the free agency of man, knows how to interpose His immediate revelation just at the moment when it is requisite for the success of the divine work, —by noticing, that when the Apostles needed this wider development of their Christian knowledge for the exercise of their vocation, and when the lack of it would have been exceedingly detrimental, —<i>at that very moment</i>, by a remarkable coincidence of inward revelation with a chain of outward circumstances, the illumination hitherto wanting was imparted to them.’<h2><u><b>1. Cæsarea</b>]</u></h2> As this town bears an important part in early Christian history, it will be well to give here a full account of it. CÆSAREA (“<i>of Palestine</i>,” called “<i>by the sea</i>” [as we say, “<i>super mare</i>”) in several places in Josephus, or <i>Stratonis</i> [see below],—distinguished from Cæsarea <i>Philippi</i>, see note Matt. xvi. 13) is between Joppa and Dora, 68 Roman miles from Jerusalem according to the Jerusalem Itinerary, 75 according to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x9RSgzFvF1Mn8m9NjqyE5DTFrVcAoKXb/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It was, even before the destruction of Jerusalem, the seat of the Roman Procurators (see ch. xxiii. 23 ff.; xxiv. 27; xxv. 1), and is called by Tacitus the <i>capital of Judæa</i>. It was chiefly inhabited by Gentiles, but there were also many thousand Jewish inhabitants. It was built by Herod the Great. Beforetime there was only a fort there, called the tower of Strato. It was fortified, provided with a haven (see ch. ix. 30; xviii. 22), and in honour of Cæsar Augustus named Cæsarea, more fully Cæsarea Sebasté. Vespasian made it a Roman colony. Abulfeda speaks of it as in ruins in his time (A.D. 1300). At present there are a few ruins only, and some fishers’ huts.<h3><u><b>a centurion</b>]</u></h3> The subordinate officer commanding the sixth part of a cohort, or half a maniple. <h3><u><b>of the band called the Italian band</b>]</u></h3> i.e. of a <i>cohort levied in Italy, not in Syria</i>. <h2><u><b>2. a devout man, and one that feared God</b>]</u></h2> i. e. he had abandoned polytheism, and was a worshipper of the true God: whether a proselyte of the gate, or not, seems uncertain. That he <i>may</i> have been such, there is nothing in the narrative to preclude: nor does Meyer’s objection apply, that it is not probable that, among the many thousand converts, no Greek proselyte had yet been admitted by baptism into the church. Many such cases may have occurred, and some no doubt had: but the object of this providential interference seems to have been, to give <i>solemn sanction </i>to such reception, by the agency of him who was both the chief of the Apostles, and the strong upholder of pure Judaism. It is hardly possible that the words “<i>of good report among all the nation of the</i> <i>Jews</i>” (ver. 22) should have been said of a Gentile not in any way conformed to the Jewish faith and worship. The great point (ch. xi. 3) which made the present event so important, was, that Cornelius was an <i>uncircumcised</i> person. Doubtless also among his <i>company</i> (ver. 24) there must have been. many who were <i>not proselytes</i>. <h3><u><b>gave much alms to the people</b>]</u></h3> i.e. to the Jewish inhabitants, see ch. xxvi. 17, 23; xxviii. 17; John xi. 50; xviii. 14, and elsewhere. <h3><u><b>prayed to God alway</b>]</u></h3> From Cornelius’s own narrative, ver. 31, as well as from the analogy of God’s dealings, we are certainly justified in inferring, with Neander, that the subject of his prayers was that he might be guided into truth, and if so, hardly without reference to that faith which was now spreading so widely over Judæa. This is not matter of conjecture, but is implied by Peter’s words, “<i>ye know,</i>” &c., in ver. 37. Further than this, we cannot infer with certainty; but, if <i>the particular difficulty present in his mind</i> be sought, we can hardly avoid the conclusion that it was connected with the apparent necessity of embracing Judaism and circumcision in order to become a believer on Christ.<h2><u><b>3. in a vision evidently</b>]</u></h2> not in a trance, as ver. 10, and ch. xxii. 17,—but <i>with his bodily eyes</i>: thus asserting the objective truth of the appearance. <h3><u><b>about the ninth hour of the day</b>]</u></h3> It here appears that Cornelius observed the Jewish hours of prayer. <h2><u><b>4. for a memorial</b>]</u></h2> i.e. ‘<i>so as to be a memorial</i>’—There has been. found a difficulty by some in the fact that Cornelius’s works were received as well pleasing to God, before he had justifying faith in Christ. But it is surely easy to answer, with Calvin and Augustine, that Cornelius could not have prayed, without faith. His faith was all that he could then attain to, and brought forth its fruits abundantly in his life: one of which fruits, and the best of them, was, the earnest seeking by prayer<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 1, Part 2, Acts, Pages 329-399 missing.</h2><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tgZaYRfvIPHOzYKpv28-MSu5v7UWTLwz/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Another reason has been given: “He seems to have feared that, had he run up the long gulf to Ephesus, he might be detained in it by the westerly winds, which blow long, especially in the spring.” But these would affect him nearly as much at. Miletus. <h2><u><b>17.</b>]</u></h2> The distance from Miletus to Ephesus is about thirty miles. He probably, therefore, stayed three or four days altogether at Miletus. <h3><u><b>the elders</b>]</u></h3> called, ver. 28, <b>bishops</b>. This circumstance began very early to contradict the growing views of the apostolic institution and necessity of prelatical episcopacy. Thus Irenæus (Cent. 2), “He called together at Miletus the <i>bishops and presbyters</i> (elders), who came from Ephesus and the rest of the churches near.” Here we see (1) the two, <i>bishops and presbyters</i>, distinguished, as if <i>both </i>were sent for, in order that the titles might not seem to belong to the same persons,—and (2) other neighbouring churches also brought in, in order that there might not seem to be <i>bishops </i>in one church only. That neither of these was the case, is clearly shewn by the plain words of this verse: “he sent <i>to Ephesus</i>, aud summoned the <i>elders of the church</i>.” So early did interested and disingenuous interpretations begin to cloud the light which Scripture might have thrown on ecclesiastical questions. The A. V. has hardly dealt fairly in this case with the sacred text, in rendering the designation <i>episcopous</i>, ver. 28,‘ <i>overseers</i>:’ whereas it ought there, as in all other places, to have been bishops, that the fact of <i>elders and bishops having been originally and apostolically synonymous</i> might be apparent to the ordinary English reader, which now it is not. <h2><u><b>18</b>.]</u></h2> The evidence furnished by this speech as to the literal report in the Acts of the words spoken by St. Paul, is most important. It is a treasure-house of words, idioms, and sentiments, peculiarly belonging to the Apostle himself. See this shewn in my Greek Test. The contents of the speech may be thus given: <i>He reminds the elders of his conduct among them</i> (vv. 18—21): <i>announces to them his final separation from them</i> (vv. 22—25): <i>and commends earnestly to them the flock committed to their charge, for which he himself had by word and work disinterestedly laboured</i> (vv. 26—35). <h3><u><b>from the first day</b>]</u></h3> These words hold a middle place, partly with “<i>ye know</i>,” partly with “<i>after what man- ner I was with you</i>.” The knowledge on their part was coextensive with his whole stay among them: so that we may take the words with <b>ye know</b>, at the same time carrying on their sense to what follows.<h3><u><b>I was with you</b>]</u></h3> So 1 Thess. i. 5, ii.10. See 1 Cor. ix. 20, 22. <h2><u><b>19. serving the Lord</b>]</u></h2> With the sole exception of the assertion of our Lord, ‘ Ye cannot serve God and mammon,’ Matt. vi. 24; Luke xvi. 13, this peculiar verb (<i>“ to be a bond-servant to”</i>), for ‘serving God,’ is used by <i>Paul only</i>, and by him seven times, viz. Rom. vii. 6, 25; xii. 11; xiv. 18; xvi.18; Phil. ii, 22; Col. iii. 24;1 Thess. i. 9.<h3><u><b>with all humility of mind</b>]</u></h3> Also a Pauline expression, 2 Cor. viii. 7; xii. 12.<h3><u><b>temptations</b>]</u></h3> See especially Gal. iv. 14. <h2><u><b>20.

In Heb. x. 38 it is different. <h2><u><b>22. bound in my spirit</b>]</u></h2> This interpretation is most probable, both from the construction, and from the usage of the expression repeatedly by and of St. Paul in the sense of <i>his own spirit</i>. See ch. xvii. 16, where the principal instances are given. Compare Rom. xii. 11; 1 Cor. v. 3; 2 Cor. ii. 13, and ch. xix. 21. <i>How </i>he was bound <i>in the spirit</i>, is manifest, by comparing other passages, where the Holy Spirit of God is related to have shaped his apostolic course. He was bound, by the Spirit of God leading captive, constraining, his own spirit.—As he went up to Jerusalem, <i>bound in his spirit</i>, so he left Judæa again <i>bound in the flesh</i>,—<i>a prisoner according to the flesh</i>.—He had no detailed knowledge of futurity—nothing but what the Holy Spirit, in general forewarnings, repeated at every point of his journey (<i>city by city</i> ; see ch. xxi. 4, 11, for two such instances), announced, viz. imprisonment and tribulations. That <i>here </i>no <i>inner voice</i> of the Spirit is meant, is evident from the words.<h2><u><b>23. the Holy Ghost witnesseth</b>]</u></h2> Compare Rom. viii. 16. <h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> The reading in the margin, amidst all the varieties, seems to be that out of which the others have all arisen, and whose difficulties they more or less explain. And the meaning will be, <i>‘I do not value my life, in comparison with the finishing my course.’</i> <h3><u><b>the finishing of my course</b>]</u></h3> See the same image, with the same word remarkably expanded, Phil. iii, 12—14.<h3><u><b>my course</b>]</u></h3> A similitude peculiar to Paul: occurring, remarkably enough, in his speech at ch. xiii. 25. He uses it without this word, at 1 Cor. ix. 24—27, and Phil. iii. 14.<h3><u><b>which I have received</b>]</u></h3> Compare Rom. i. 5, “<i>by whom we [have] </i>received <i>grace and apostleship</i>.”<h2><u><b>25.</b>]</u></h2> It has been argued from the words <b>among whom I have gone</b>, that the elders of other churches besides that of Ephesus must have been present. But it might just as well have been argued, that every one to whom St. Paul had there preached must have been present, on account of the words ye all. If he could regard the elders as the representatives of the various churches, of which there can be no doubt, why may not he similarly have regarded the <i>Ephesian </i>elders as representatives of the churches of proconsular Asia, and have addressed all in addressing them? Or may not these words have even a wider application, viz. to <i>all </i>who had been the subjects of his former personal ministry, in Asia and Europe, now addressed through the Ephesian elders?—See the question, whether Paul <i>ever did see the Asiatic churches again</i>, discussed in the Introduction to the Pastoral Epistles, § 2. 18 ff. I may remark here, that such an expression in the mouth of St. Paul, does not necessarily imply that he spoke from divine and unerring knowledge, but expresses his own conviction of the certainty of what he is saying: see ch. xxvi. 27, which is much to our point, as expressing his firm persuasion that king Agrippa <i>was </i>a believer in the prophets : but certainly no infallible knowledge of his heart:—Rom. xv. 29, where<br><br><br><br>also a firm persuasion is expressed :—Phil. i. 19, 20, where his <i>knowledge</i>, ver. 19, is explained to rest on his <i>expectation and hope</i>, in ver. 20.

I, 1—7.</b>]</u></h1> ADDRESS THE EPISTLE, WITH AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF PAUL’s CALLING TO BE AN APOSTLE OF THE GOSPEL OF THE SON OF GOD. It has been remarked by Calvin, that this whole Epistle is exquisitely and skilfully arranged, so that its great argument seems to flow out of the natural and rational progress of its ordinary thought. Beginning with the proof of his Apostleship, St. Paul thence comes to the Commendation of the Gospel:this in its turn brings on a disputation concerning faith; to which then, as if led to it by the context, he gives himself.And thus he enters on the grand subject of the whole Epistle, justification by faith, which employs him as far as the end of the fifth chapter. St. Paul in the addresses of his Epistles never uses the common Greek formula “<i>greeting</i>” (James i. 1), but always a <i>prayer for blessing</i> on those to whom he is writing. In all his Epistles (and in both those of Peter, and in the Apocalypse) this prayer is for “<i>grace and peace</i>,” except in 1 and 2 Tim., where it is for “<i>grace, mercy, and peace</i>,” as in 2 John. In Jude only we find “<i>mercy, peace, and love</i>.’—The address here differs from those of most of Paul’s Epistles, in having doctrinal clauses parenthetically inserted:—such are found also in the address of the Epistle to Titus, and (in much less degree) in that of the Epistle to the Galatians. These doctrinal clauses regard, 1. the <i>fore-announcement of the Gospel through the prophets</i> : 2. <i>the description and dignity of Him</i> who was the subject of that Gospel: 3. <i>the nature and aim of the apostolic office</i> to which Paul had been called,—including the <i>persons addressed</i> in the objects of its ministration. <h2><u><b>1. A servant of Jesus Christ</b>]</u></h2> So also Phil. i. 1, and Tit. i, 1 (“<i>a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>”),—but usually “<i>an apostle of Jesus Christ</i>” (or, “<i>of Christ Jesus</i>”)(2 Cor., Eph., Col., 1 Tim., 2 Tim.): “a [called] apostle of Jesus Christ” (1 Cor.),—simply “<i>an apostle</i>” (Gal.),—“<i>a prisoner of Jesus Christ</i>” (Philem.). The expression ‘servant of God” is the especial Old Test. title of Israel, and of individuals, as Moses, Joshua, David, Daniel, Job, and others, who as prophets, kings, &c., were raised up for the express work of God. <b>Servant</b> must not be rendered “ <i>slave</i>,” nor merely “ <i>pious worshipper</i> :” because the former excludes the element of freewill, while the latter does not express the entire dedication to Christ. <h3><u><b>called to be an apostle]</u></h3></b> In naming himself a <i>servant of Jesus Christ</i>, he bespeaks their attention as a <i>Christian speaking to Christians </i>: he now further specifies the <i>place which he held by the special calling of God</i>; <b>called</b>, and that to the very highest office, of <b>an apostle</b>; and even more—among the Apostles, not one by original selection, but one <i>specially called</i>. “The rest of the apostles were educated by long intercourse with Jesus, and were called first to follow Him and obey Him, then put forth as Apostles.

Thus the <i>called apostle</i> had a similitude and relation to the <i>called saints</i>.” Bengel. <br><br><b>apostle</b> must not be taken here in the wider sense, of a <i>missionary</i>, as in ch. xvi. 7, but in its higher and peculiar meaning, in which the Twelve bore the title (“<i>whom he also named apostles</i>,” Luke vi. 13), and Paul (and perhaps Barnabas), and James the Lord’s brother. This title was not conferred on Paul by the separation ordered by the Holy Spirit, Acts xiii. 2, <i>but in virtue of his special call by the Lord in person</i> ; compare the expression “<i>a chosen vessel</i>” (“<i>a vessel of choice</i>”), Acts ix. 15, with “<i>Have not I chosen you twelve</i>?” John vi. 70; also compare John xiii. 18; xv. 16 Acts i. 2. “I cannot agree,” says Calvin, “with those who refer this word—<b>called</b>—to Paul’s personal eternal election of God.” <h3><u><b>separated</b>]</u></h3> not as in Acts xiii. 2 merely, though that was a particular application of the general truth: —but (as in Gal. i. 15) “<i>God, who separated me from my mother’s womb.</i>” “The same idea of <i>separation</i> is at the root of the word <i>Pharisee</i>: but here Paul signifies that he was separated by God, not only from among men, from among Jews, from among the disciples, but even from among teachers themselves.” Bengel. <h3><u><b>unto</b> <b>i. e. for the purpose of announcing. the gospel of God</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>the good tidings sent by</b> (not concerning) <b>God</b>. The genitive is not, as in “<i>the Gospel of the kingdom</i>,” Matt. iv. 23, Mark i. 14, one of apposition, but of <i>possession</i> or origin; <b>God’s Gospel</b>. And so, whenever the expression ‘<i>the Gospel of Christ</i>’ occurs, it is not ‘the Gospel <i>about</i> Christ,’ but <i>Christ’s Gospel</i>; that Gospel which flows out of His grace, and is His gift to men. —Thus in the very beginning of the Epistle, these two short words announce that the Gospel is <i>of God</i>,—in other words, that <i>salvation is of grace only</i>. <h2><u><b>2</b>.]</u></h2> This <i>good tidings</i> is no new invention, no after-thought,—but was <i>long ago announced</i> in what God’s prophets wrote concerning His Son:—and announced by way of <i>promise</i>, so that God stood pledged to its realization. “Since the charge of bringing in novelties was brought against the Gospel, he shews that it was older than the Greeks, and long ago shadowed out in the prophets.” Chrysostom. <h2><u><b>3. concerning his Son</b>]</u></h2> belongs to “<i>which he had promised afore</i>,” above,—<b>which he promised beforehand</b>, &c., <b>concerning His Son</b>, i. e.‘which (good tidings) He promised beforehand, &c., <i>and indicated that it should be concerning His Son</i>.’ This is more natural than (as is done in the A. V.) to bind these words to “<i>the Gospel of God</i>,” which went before. Either meaning will suit ver. 9 equally well.—Christ, the Son of God, is the <i>great subject</i> of the good news. <h3><u><b>which was born</b>]</u></h3> or, <b>became</b>: not, as in A. V., “<i>was made</i>.” There is nothing in the word indicating <i>creation</i>, however true that may have been: see John i. 14. <h3><u><b>according to the flesh</b>]</u></h3> On the side of His humanity, our Lord became, was born; <i>that</i> nature of His begins only then, when He was “<i>made (born) of a woman</i>,” Gal.iv. 4. <br><br><b>flesh</b> is here used exactly as in John i. 14, “<i>the word became flesh</i>,” to signify <i>that whole nature, body, and soul</i>,of which the outward visible tabernacle of the FLESH is the concrete representation to our senses.— The words <b>of the seed of David</b> cast a hint back at the promise just spoken of. At the same time, in so solemn an enunciation of the dignity of the Son of God, they serve to shew that even according to the human side, His descent had been fixed in the line of him who was Israel’s anointed and greatest king.<b> </b><h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> The simple antithesis would have been, <i>which was born... according to the flesh, but was the Son of God according to the Spirit</i>, see 1 Tim. iii. 16.

Also (3) by amplifying the <i>Spirit</i> into <b>the Spirit of holiness</b>, he characterizes the Spirit of Christ as one of absolute holiness, i.e. as <i>divine</i>, and <i>partaking</i> of the God-<i>head</i> : see below. <h3><u><b>with power</b>]</u></h3> This qualifying clause belongs to <b>declared</b>,—not to the words “<i>the Son of God</i>,”—nor again is it a parallel clause to “<i>according to the Spirit of holiness</i>,” to “by the resurrection,” &c.

It is not the objective <i>appointment</i> of Christ as the Son of God, that is spoken of, but the subjective manifestation in men’s minds that He is so: not of Christ’s <i>being</i> what He is, but of the <i>proof</i> of that fact by His Resurrection.<h3><u><b>according to the Spirit of holiness</b>]</u></h3> The Spirit of holiness is not equivalent to “the <b>Holy Spirit</b> :” this epithet would be inapplicable here, for it would point out the <i>Third Person in the Blessed Trinity, whereas it is the Spirit of Christ Himself</i>, in distinction from His Flesh, which is spoken of. And this Spirit is designated by the gen. of quality, <b>of holiness</b>, to shew that it is not a human, but a divine Spirit which is attributed <i>here</i> to Christ,—a Spirit to which holiness belongs as its essence. The other interpretations certainly miss the mark, by overlooking the terms, <i>according to the flesh</i> and <i>according to the Spirit</i>, the two sides of the Person of Christ here intended to be brought out. Such are that of Theodoret : “through the might wrought in Him by means of the Holy Spirit,”— Chrysostom : “from the Spirit, by whom He gave sanctification,” &c. Calvin and Olshausen also seem to wish to include the notion of <i>sanctifying</i> in the term <b>holiness</b>, which, how ever true, is more than strictly belongs to the words. <h3><u><b>by</b>]</u></h3> as indicating the source, out of which the demonstration proceeds. <h3><u><b>the resurrection of the dead</b>]</u></h3> not, “the resurrection <i>from</i> the dead,”’—which, besides that it is not the rendering of the words of the original, would be a weakening of the strong expression of the Apostle, who takes here summarily and by anticipation the Resurrection of Jesus as being, including, involving (“<i> <b>I am</b> the Resurrection</i>,” John xi. 25) <i>the (whole) Resurrection of the dead.</i> So that we must not render as A. V. “the resurrection from the dead,” but <b>the resurrection of the dead</b>, regarded as accomplished in that of Christ. It was the full accomplishment of this, which more than any thing declared Him to be the Son of God: see John v. 25—29. Thus in these words lies wrapped up the argument of ch. vi. 4 ff. <h3><u><b>even Jesus Christ our Lord</b>]</u></h3> This is the place of these words in the original, and to this place they ought to be kept. For the Apostle having given this description of the Person and dignity of the Son of God, very Man and very God, now identifies this divine Person with JESUS CHRIST, the Lord and Master of Christians,—the historical object of their faith, and (see words following) the Appointer of himself to the apostolic office.<h2><u><b>5. through whom</b>]</u></h2> As in Gal. i. 1; 1 Cor. i. 9, designating the Lord Himself as the Agent in conferring the grace and Apostleship. <h3><u><b>we received</b>]</u></h3> not ‘<i>all Christians</i>, —but <i>we</i>, the Apostle himself as he not unfrequently speaks. No others need be here included in the word. <i>Those to whom he is writing</i> cannot be thus included, for they are specially contrasted with the subject of the verb <b>received</b> by the following verse. Nor can this verb <b>received</b> (not, as A. V., “<i>have received</i>”) refer to any <i>general</i> bestowal of this kind, indicating, as it must, a definite past event, viz. the reception of the Apostleship by himself. <h3><u><b>grace</b>]</u></h3> It is hardly to be understood, as Augustine explains, that “the Apostle has grace in common with all the faithful, but<i> Apostleship</i> not in<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tXtGG6xy2BNJZqnTeWh0K9bA3JQqj3uw/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The<i> existence</i> of such a power is not hereby denied, but <i>this place</i> refers <i>solely to the office of Paul</i> as an Apostle. It was the general bestowal of <i>grace</i>, which was the condition of and introduced the special bestowal (<b>and</b>, as so often, coupling a specific portion to a whole) of <i>apostleship</i> : compare 1 Cor. xv. 10. <h3><u><b>unto</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>with a view to</b>,—‘in order to bring about.’ <h3><u><b>obedience of faith</b>]</u></h3> Such is the literal rendering of the words; and this ought to be kept in the translation. They may mean either, <i>obedience which is the result of faith, or, obedience, the object of which is the faith ; obedience, </i>in fact<i>, to the faith</i>, as in Acts vi. 7, “<i>a great multitude of the priests were obedient unto the faith</i>.” Understood either way, these words form an introduction to the great subject of the Epistle. <br><br><b>in order to bring about obedience of faith among all (the) nations (or, all the Gentiles</b>: the word rendered Gentiles being always the same as that meaning <i>nations</i>). The Jews do not here come into account. There is no inclusion, and at the same time no express exclusion of them: but Paul was commissioned as <i>the Apostle of the Gentiles</i>, and he here magnifies the great office entrusted to him. <h3><u><b>for his name’s sake</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>on behalf of his name</b>; ‘for His glory” “In the <i>name of Christ</i> is summed up what He had done and was, what the Christian ever bore in mind, the zeal which marked him, the name wherewith he was named.” Jowett. The words are best taken as belonging to the whole verse: as declaring the purpose for which the grace and apostleship had been received. <h2><u><b>6. among whom</b>]</u></h2> The whole should be taken together: <b>among whom ye also are called of Jesus Christ;</b> otherwise, with a comma at <b>also</b>, the assertion, ‘<i>among whom are ye also</i>,’ is flat and unmeaning. Some would take <b>of Jesus Christ</b> as a genitive of <i>possession</i>, because the call of believers is generally referred to the FATHER; but sometimes the SON is said to call likewise, see John v. 25; 1 Tim. i. 12;—and with <b>beloved of God </b>following so close upon it, the expression can I think hardly be taken otherwise than as <b>called by Jesus Christ</b>. <h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> This verse follows, in the sense, close on ver. 1. <h3><u><b>beloved of God</b>, <b>called to be saints</b>]</u></h3> Both these clauses refer to <i>all the Christians addressed </i>: not (as Bengel) the first to Jewish, the second to Gentile believers. No such distinction would be in place in an exordium which anticipates. the result of the Epistle—that Jew and Gentile are one in guilt, and one in Christ.<h3><u><b>from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ</b>]</u></h3> God is the Giver of grace and peace,—Christ the <i>Imparter</i>.<h2><u><b>8—17.</b>]</u></h2> <i>OPENING OF THE EPISTLE. His thankfulness for the faith of the Romans: remembrance of them in his prayers: wish to visit them: hindrances hitherto, but still earnest intention of doing so, that he may further ground them in that Gospel, of which he is not ashamed, inasmuch as it is THE POWER OF GOD TO ALL WHO BELIEVE. This leads to the announcement (in a citation from the Scripture) of one great subject of the Epistle,—viz.: JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH</i>.<h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> This placing himself in intimate connexion with his readers by mention of and thankfulness for their faith or Christian graces, is the constant habit of St. Paul. The three Epistles, Gal., 1 Tim., and Titus, are the only exceptions: 2 Cor. may seem to be such, but in ch.i. 3—22 we have an equivalent: see especially, vv. 6, 7.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TY1hmPdgQM642EaLAEULsab_tXpfyCxT/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is literally, First indeed... and the sentence answering to this is found at ver. 13, ‘Ye indeed are prospering in the faith: but<b> I</b> still am anxious <i>further</i> to advance that fruitfulness.’<h3><u><b>my God</b>]</u></h3> “See with what skill in the arrangement of terms he gives thanks. For he does not say, ‘<i>to God</i>,’ but <b>to my God</b>: which also the prophets do, appropriating to themselves that which is common to all. And what wonder, if they do? For we see God continually Himself doing the same in speaking of His servants, calling Himself, with a like appropriation, the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob.” Chrysostom. <h3><u><b>through Jesus Christ</b>]</u></h3> “He offers his sacrifice of thanksgiving as through the Great High Priest: for he who would offer a sacrifice must know that it must be offered through the hands of the High Priest.” Origen. So also Calvin, “We have here an example, how thanks are to be offered through Christ, according to the apostolic precept, Heb. xiii. 15.” Olshausen says, “This is no mere phrase, but a true expression of the deepest conviction. For only by the Spirit of Christ dwelling in men’s hearts are thanksgivings and prayer acceptable to God.” But perhaps here it is better to take the words as expressing an acknowledgment that the faith of the Romans, for which thanks were given, <i>was due to and rested on </i>the Lord Jesus Christ: see ch. vii. 25, and the rendering there.<h3><u><b>your faith</b>]</u></h3> “In congratulations of this kind Panl sometimes describes the whole Christian character, Col. i. 3 ff., or some portion of it, 1 Cor. i.5. And thus here he celebrates their faith, agreeably to his design, verses 12, 17.” Bengel.<h3><u><b>published</b>]</u></h3> De Wette notices the other side of the report, as given by the Jews at Rome, Acts xxviii. 22, to Paul himself. This <i>praise </i>was in the <i>Christian churches</i>, and brought by <i>Christian brethren</i>.<h3><u><b>throughout the whole world</b>]</u></h3> A popular hyperbole, common every where, and especially when speaking of general diffusion through the Roman empire, the ‘orbis terrarum.’ The praise would be heard in every city where there was a Christian church,—intercouse with the metropolis of the world being common to all.<h2><u><b>9.</b>]</u></h2> “A pious asseveration, concerning a thing necessary to be stated, and unknown. to men, especially to those who were unknown to the writer, and remote from him.” Bengel. There could be no other witness to his practice in his secret prayers, but God: and as the assertion of a habit. of incessantly praying for the Roman Christians, whom he had never seen, might seem to savour of an exaggerated expression of affection, he solemnly appeals to this only possible testimony. To the Eph., Phil. (see however Phil. i. 8), Col., Thess., he gives the same assurance, but without the asseveration. The thus calling God to witness is no uncommon practice with St. Paul: see references. <h3><u><b>whom I serve in my spirit</b>]</u></h3> The<i> serving God in his spirit</i> was a guarantee that his pro- fession was sincere, and that the oath just taken was no mere form, but a solemn and earnest appeal of his spirit. See also Phil. iii, 3, and John iv. 24. “The Apostle means that he is an intelligent true priest. of his God, not in the temple, but in his spirit,—not at the altar, but in the gospel of His Son.” Umbreit. <h3><u><b>in the gospel</b>]</u></h3> “The addition of these words shews the <i>kind</i> of his service.” Chrysostom. His peculiar method of service was concerned with the gospel of the Son of God. “Some take this addition, as if Paul wished to commend his service of God on account of its agreement with the commands of the Gospel, seeing that a service of God in the spirit is prescribed to us in the Gospel. But the other interpretation is far more agreeable to the sense, viz. that he renders his service to God in the preaching of the Gospel.” Calvin. See the use of the word “<i>Gospel</i>,” Phil. iv. 15. <h3><u><b>how unceasingly</b>]</u></h3> The words thus rendered may also mean, “that <b>without ceasing.</b>” The rendering in the text seems the better of the two.

So in Simon’s entreaty, Acts viii. 24, “<i>Pray ye to the Lord for me</i>, [in order] <i>that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me</i>,’ where the latter clause represents not the <i>contents</i> of the prayer, but the <i>end aimed</i> at by it.<h3><u><b>now at length</b>]</u></h3> i.e. before long:—literally, ‘<i>at last, some day or other</i>?<h3><u><b>shall have a way opened</b>]</u></h3> S<b>hall be allowed, prospered</b>. The rendering of the A. V., ‘<i>I might have a prosperous journey</i>, is incorrect, <br><br><b>by</b>, i.e. in the course of,<b>the will of God</b>. <h2><u><b>11. that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift</b>]</u></h2> That the <i>gift</i> here spoken of was no mere supernatural power of working in the Spirit, the whole context shews, as well as the meaning of the word itself in ch. v. 15, 16; vi. 23. And even if the word barely taken, could ever (1 Cor. xii. 4, 9 are no examples, see there) mean technically a <i>supernatural endowment of the Spirit</i>, yet the epithet <i>spiritual</i>, and the object of imparting this gift, <i>confirmation in the faith</i>, would here preclude that meaning. Besides, St. Paul did not value the mere bestowal of these ‘gifts’ so highly, as to make it the subject of his earnest prayers incessantly. The gift alluded to was the comfort (mutual confirmation in the faith) spoken of below. <br><br><b>spiritual</b>:—springing from the Spirit of God, and imparted to the spirit of man. <h3><u><b>to the end that ye may be established</b>]</u></h3> Knowing the trials to which they were exposed, and being conscious of the fulness of spiritual power for edification (2 Cor. xiii. 10) given to him, he longed to impart some of it to them, that they might be confirmed. “The Apostle does not say ‘<i>to the end that I may establish you</i>,’ for this belongs to God; see ch. xvi. 25, He is only the instrument: hence the passive.” Philippi.<h2><u><b>12.</b>]</u></h2> “Then since this saying seemed to assume too much to himself, see how he tempers it by what he puts after it. ‘That, they might not say, What? are we unsteady and wavering, and want thy tongue in order that we may stand firmly ? he anticipates this objection, and precludes such an answer by saying (as in ver. 12). It is as if he had said, Do not suppose that I said it, finding fault with you: it was not with this view that I spoke the words; but this is what I wished to say: Ye are undergoing many trials in being harassed by your persecutors: I therefore desired to see you that I may comfort you,—or rather not that I only may comfort you, but may myself also receive comfort from you.” Chrysostom.See the same wish expressed in differentwords ch, xv, 32, and the partial realization of it, Acts xxviii. 15. The A. V. has, <i>by the mutual faith both of you and me</i>. This is hardly the proper use of the word mutual, which should mean, <i>faith which each has in the other</i>; whereas the comfort here is to spring from the faith which each sees in the other. The rendering in the text is therefore to be preferred. <b>Faith</b> is used in the most general sense—<i>faith</i> as the necessary condition and working instrument of all Christian exhortation, comfort, and confirmation; producing these, and evidenced by them.<h2><u><b>13.

The words <b>but was hindered hitherto</b> are best as a parenthesis, The <i>reason of the hindrance</i> is given in ch. xv. 20–22: it was, <i>his scrupulous care to preach the gospel where it had not been preached before, rather than on the foundation of others</i>.<h3><u><b>some fruit</b>]</u></h3> The meaning is not. here ‘wages,’ or ‘result of my apostolic labour,’ for such is not the ordinary meaning of the word in the New Test., but <i>fruit borne by you</i> who have been planted to bring forth fruit to God. This fruit I should then gather and present to God ; compare the figure in ch. xv. 16: see also Phil. i. 22 and note. <h2><u><b>14.</b>]</u></h2> The connexion seems to be this: He wishes to have some fruit, some produce of expended labour, among the Romans as among the rest of the Gentiles. Till this was the case, he himself was a <i>debtor</i> to every such people: which situation of <i>debtor</i> he wished to change, by paying the debt and conferring a benefit, into that of one having money out at interest there, and yielding a <i>fruit</i>. The debt which he owed to all nations was (ver. 15) the obligation laid on him to preach the gospel to them: see 1 Cor. ix. 16.<h3><u><b>Greeks </b>—<b> Barbarians </b>—<b> wise </b>—<b> unwise</b>]</u></h3> These words must not be pressed as applying to any particular churches, or as if any one of them designated the Romans themselves,—or even as if <b>wise</b> belonged to <b>Greeks</b> and <b>unwise</b> to <b>Barbarians</b>. They are used, apparently, merely as comprehending <i>all Gentiles</i>, whether considered in regard of race or of intellect; and are placed here certainly not without a prospective reference to the universality of guilt, and need of the gospel, which he is presently about to prove existed in the Gentile world.—Notice that he does not call himself a debtor to the <i>Jews</i>—for they can hardly be included under the designation Barbarians (see Col. iii. 11). Though he had earnest desires for them (ch. ix. 1–3; x. 1), and every where preached to them first, this was not his peculiar <i>debt</i>, or bounden duty : see Gal. ii.7, where he describes himself as “<i>entrusted, put in charge, with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Peter with that of the circumcision</i>.”<h2><u><b>15. So . . .</b>]</u></h2> Having spoken of the whole obligation resting upon him, he now infers, from that, his readiness to fulfil one principal part of it, ‘I am ready to preach the Gospel, as to all Gentiles, so to you, who hold no mean place among them.’<h2><u><b>16.</b>]</u></h2> The words, <b>For I am not ashamed</b>, &c., seem to be suggested by the <i>position of the Romans in the world</i>. ‘Yea, to you at Rome also: for, though your city is mistress of the world, though your emperors are worshipped as present deities, though you are elated by your pomps and luxuries and victories, yet I am not ashamed of the apparently mean origin of the gospel which I am to preach ; for (and here is the transition to his great theme) it is, &c. <h3><u><b>for it is the power of God</b>]</u></h3> The gospel, which is the greatest example of the Power of God, he strikingly calls <i>that Power itself</i>. So in 1 Cor. i. 24 he calls Christ, <i>the Power of God</i>. But not only is the gospel the great example of divine Power; it is the <i>field of agency</i> of the power of God, working in it, and interpenetrating it throughout. In barely saying here that it is <b>the power</b> of God, the Apostle intends to convey (as also in 1 Cor. i. 24) a <i>superlative </i>sense; the <i>highest and holiest vehicle</i> of the divine Power, the power <i>by excellence</i>. “It is<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dNaPRnYYWbYCQOOuhQszgaFg0BINXVDh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And the <i>direction in which</i> this power acts in the gospel is <b>unto or towards salvation</b>—it is a<i> healing, saving power</i>: for as Chrysostom reminds us, there is a power of God <i>unto punishment</i>, and <i>unto destruction</i>, see Matt. x. 28.—But <i>to whom</i> is this gospel the power of God to save? <b>To every one that believeth</b>. The <i>universality </i>implied in <b>every one</b>, the <i>condition</i> necessitated in the qualification added, that believeth, and the <b>power of God</b> acting <b>unto salvation</b>, are the great subjects treated of in the former part of this Epistle. <i>All</i> are proved to be <i>under sin</i>, and so <i>needing God’s righteousness </i>(ch. i. 18–iii. 20), and the <i>entrance</i> into this righteousness is shewn to be <i>by fait</i>h (ch. iii. 21–v. 11). Then the <i>power of God </i>in freeing from the dominion of sin and death, and as issuing in salvation, is set forth (ch. v. 11–viii. 39). So that if the subject of the Epistle is to be stated in few words, these should be chosen: <b>the Gospel, the power of God unto salvation unto every one that believeth</b>. This expresses it better than merely ‘<i>justification by faith</i>, which is in fact only a subordinate part of the great theme,—only <i>the condition necessitated by man’s sinfulness for his entering the state of salvation</i>: whereas the argument extends <i>beyond this</i>, to the <i>death unto sin</i> and <i>life unto God</i> and <i>carrying forward of the sanctifying work of the Spirit</i>, from its first fruits even to its completion. <h3><u><b>to the Jew first, and also to the Greek</b>]</u></h3> This is the<i> Jewish</i> expression for all mankind, as “<i> Greeks and Barbarians</i>,” ver. 14, is the Greek one. The term <b>Greek</b> here includes <i>all Gentiles</i>. The priority here mentioned is not in order of time, but is <b>principally</b> (comp. ch. ii. 9) spoken of <i>national precedence</i>, in the sense in which the Jews were to our Lord “<i>his own</i>,” John i. 11. Salvation was “<i>from the Jews</i>,” John iv. 22. See ch. ix.5; xi. 24. Not that the Jew has any <i>preference</i> under the gospel; only he <i>inherits</i> and has a <i>precedence</i>. <h2><u><b>17.</b>]</u></h2> An explanation,<i> how</i> the gospel is the <i>power</i> <i>of God to salvation</i>, and how it is so <i>to the believer</i> :—because in it <b>God’s righteousness</b> (not His <i>attribute</i> of righteousness,—‘the righteousness of God,’ but righteousness <i>flowing from</i>, <i>and acceptable to Him</i>) is unfolded, and the more, the more we believe. I subjoin De Wette’s note on the words. “The Greek and Hebrew words rendered ‘<i>righteousness</i>, are taken sometimes for ‘ virtue” and ‘piety,’ which men possess or strive after,—sometimes imputatively, for ‘freedom from blame’ or ‘justification’ The latter meaning is most usual with Paul: ‘<i>righteousness</i>’ is that which is so in the sight of God (ch. ii. 13), the result of His justifying forensic Judgment, or of ‘<i>Imputation</i>’ (ch. iv. 5). It may certainly be imagined, that a man <i>might obtain </i>justification by <i>fulfilling the law</i>: in that case his righteousness is ‘<i>righteousness of his own</i>’ (ch. x. 3), a <i>righteousness springing from the law</i> (Phil. iii. 9). But it is impossible for him to obtain a ‘righteousness of his own,’ which at the same time shall avail before God (ch. iii. 20; Gal. ii. 16). The Jews not only <i>have</i> not fulfilled the law (ch. iii. 9–19), but <i>could not</i> fulfil it (vii. 7 ff.): the Gentiles likewise have rendered themselves obnoxious to the divine wrath (i. 24–32). God has ordained that the whole race should be included in disobedience. Now if man is to become righteous from being unrighteous,—this can only happen by God’s grace,—because God<i> declares him righteous</i>, assumes him to be righteous,<i> justifies</i> him (iii, 24; Gal. iii, 8):—to justify is not only negative, ‘<i>to acquit</i>,’ but also positive, ‘<i>to declare righteous</i> ;’ but never “to make righteous’ by transformation, or imparting of moral strength by which moral perfection may be attained. Justification must be taken as the old protestant dogmatists rightly took it, in a <i>forensic</i> or <i>imputative </i>sense. God justifies for Christ’s sake (ch. iii. 22 ff.) on condition of faith in Him as Mediator: the result of <i>His justification is ‘righteousness by faith</i>, and as He imparts it freely, it is ‘<i>the righteousness of God</i>,’ or <i>from God </i>(so it ought to be), Phil.iii. 9. ‘<i>The righteousness of God</i>’ is ordinarily taken for <i>that which is righteousness with God in God’s sight</i>; compare<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YBcYrz2ZXI0fzY3yphBFkklzObqfbbX2/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This justification is certainly an <i>objective </i>act of God: but it must also be <i>subjectively</i> apprehended (i. e. within him who is the subject of it), as its <i>condition</i> is subjective, i.e. dependent on such inner reception by its subject. It is <i>the acquittal from guilt, and cheerfulness of conscience, attained through faith in God’s grace in Christ</i>,—the very frame of mind which would be proper to a perfectly righteous man—if such there were,—the harmony of the spirit with God,—peace with God. All interpretations which overlook the fact of imputation are erroneous.” To say, with Jowett, that all attempts to define <i>the righteousness of God</i> are “the afterthoughts of theology, which have no real place in the interpretation of Scripture,” is in fact to shut our eyes to the great doctrinal facts of Christianity, and float off at once into uncertainty about the very foundations of the Apostle’s argument and our own faith. <h3><u><b>is revealed</b>]</u></h3> The verb in the original is generally used of <i>making known</i> a thing hitherto concealed: but here of that gradually more complete realization of the state of justification before God by faith in Christ, which is the continuing and increasing gift of God to the believer in the gospel. <h3><u><b>from faith</b>]</u></h3> “<b>from</b> points to the condition, or the subjective ground. Faith is in the sense of <i>trust</i>, and that (1) <i>a trustful assumption of a truth</i> in reference to knowledge,—which is equivalent to conviction : (2) <i>a trustful surrender of the soul, as regards the feeling.</i> Here it is especially the latter of these: that trust reposed in God’s grace in Christ, which tranquillizes the soul and frees it from all guilt,—and especially trust in the atoning death of Jesus. Bound up with this (not by the meaning of the words, but by the idea of unconditional trust, which excludes all reserve) is <i>humility</i>, consisting in the abandonment of all merits of a man’s own, and recognition of his own unworthiness and need of redemption.” De Wette.<h3><u><b>unto faith</b>]</u></h3> i. e. <i>to him that believes</i>. This seems the most probable interpretation, making<i> faith</i> almost equivalent to the <i>person possessing faith</i>, see ch. iii. 22: but not entirely,—it is still the aspect, the <i>phase</i>, of the man, which is receptive of the righteousness of God, and to this it is revealed. The other principal interpretation—‘<i>proceeding from faith, and leading to a higher degree of faith</i>’—does not seem so suitable or forcible. <h3><u><b>even as it is written</b>]</u></h3> He shews that <i>righteousness by faith is no new idea</i>, but found in the prophets. The words are cited again in Gal. iii. 11; Heb. x. 38: in the former place with the same purpose as here. They are used in Habakkuk with reference to credence given to the prophetic word: but properly speaking, <i>all faith is one</i>, in whatever word or act of God reposed: so that the Apostle is free from any charge of forcing the words to the present purpose. There are two ways of arranging them: <i>the righteous shall live by faith</i>, and <i>the righteous by faith</i>,<i> he who is righteous by faith, shall live</i>. But in fact they amount to the same: if the former, which is more agreeable to the Heb., be taken, shall live must mean, ‘shall live <i>on, endure in his</i> righteousness, <i>by means of faith</i>,’ which would assert that it was a righteousness of faith, as strongly as does the latter. Delitzsch says, “The Apostle rests no more on our text than it will bear, He only places its assertion, that the life of the just springs from his faith, in the light of the New Test.”<h1><u><b>CHAP.

The necessary condition of this revelation is, the DESTRUCTION <i>of the righteousness of</i> MAN by the revelation of God’s anger against sin. <br><br><b>is revealed</b>,not <i>in the Gospel</i>: not <i>in men’s consciences: not in the miserable state of the then world</i>: but (as implied indeed by the adjunct <b>from heaven</b>,—that it is a <i>providential, universally-to-be-seen</i> revelation) in the PUNISHMENTS which, ver. 24, God, has made to follow upon sin, see also ch. ii. 2. So that revealed is said of an <i>objective reality her</i>e, not of an evangelic internal and subjective unfolding.<br><br><b>the wrath of God </b>is put, but with the deepest truth, for <i>the righteousness of God in punishment</i> (see ch. ii. 8; v. 9; Eph. ii. 3; Matt. iii, 7; John iii. 36). It is the opposite, in the divine attributes, of <i>Love</i>. <h3><u><b>ungodliness</b>]</u></h3> (i.e. godlessness, living without God),—and <b>unrighteousness</b> (i.e. iniquity, injustice of thought and conduct). Neither term is exclusive of the other, nor to be formally pressed to its limits. They overlap and include each other by a large margin: the specific difference being, that ungodliness is more the <i>fountain</i> (but at the same time partially the result) of<i> unrighteousness</i>,—which <i>unrighteousness </i>is more the <i>result </i>(but at the same time partially the fountain) of <i>ungodliness</i>. <b>Unrighteousness </b>is the <i>state</i> of the thoughts and feelings and habits, induced originally by forgetfulness of God, and in its turn inducing impieties of all kinds. We may notice by the way, that the word <i>ungodliness</i> forms an interesting link to the Pastoral Epistles, where it, and its opposite, <i>godliness</i>, are the ordinary terms for an unholy and a holy life. <h3><u><b>of men,who hold down (or hold back) the truth in unrighteousness</b>]</u></h3> who, possessing enough of the germs of religious and moral verity to preserve them from abandonment, have checked the development of this <i>truth </i>in their lives, in the love and practice of sin. That this is the meaning here is plain: see the discussion in my Greek Testament.<br><br>This meaning, ‘<i>keeping back</i>,’ ‘<i>hindering the development of</i>, admirably suits the sense, that men had (sce vv. 19 ff.) knowledge of God sufficient, if its legitimate work had been allowed, to have kept them from such excesses of enormity as they have committed, but that this <i>truth</i> they <i>held down</i>, or <i>back</i>, in unrighteousness, i.e. <i>crushed, quenched</i>, in (as the element, conditional medium) their state and practice of unrighteousness. It is plain that to take in unrighteousness for <i>unrighteously</i>, is to miss the force of the expression altogether—the pregnant ‘<i>in and by</i>’ implying that it is their unrighteousness,—the very absence of <i>righteousness </i>for which the argument contends,—which is the <i>state wherein, and the instrument whereby </i>they hold back the truth lit up in their consciences. <h2><u><b>19.</b>]</u></h2> because may either give the reason <i>why the anger of God is revealed</i>, and thus apply to all that follows as far as ver. 32, being taken up again at vv. 21, 24, 26, 28: or may explain the phænomena of these men holding back the truth in unrighteousness: which latter seems most probable : the words understood being, ‘(this charge I bring against them,) because.’ For he proves, first (ver. 20) that they <i>had the truth</i> ; then (vv. 21 ff.) <i>that they held it back</i>. <br><br><b>that which is known</b>, the objective knowledge patent and recognized in Creation:—not, as A. V., inconsistently with the meaning of the word in the original, ‘<i>that which may be known</i>,’ which would assert what, as simple matter of fact, was not the case, that <i>all which could be known of God</i> was manifest in them. He speaks <i>now</i> not of what they <i>might have known of God</i>, but of what they <i>did know</i>. Thus the expression will mean, <i>that universal objective knowledge of God as the Creator</i>, which we find more or less in every nation under heaven, and which, as matter of historical fact, was proved to be in possession of the great Gentile nations of antiquity. <b>is manifest in them</b>, i.e. <i>in their hearts</i>: not, <i>to them</i>,—nor, <i>among them</i>, for if it had been a thing acknowledged <i>among them</i>, it would not have been <i>held</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PXQKTuyt2WrpSD21syT0UvRsAavMElNR/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Every man has in him this know- ledge; his senses convey it to him (see next verse) with the phænomena of nature.<h3><u><b>for God manifested it unto them</b>]</u></h3> gives the reason why that which is known of God is manifest in them, viz. because God Himself so created the world, as to leave impressed on it this testimony to Himself.—Notice, and keep to, the <i>historic</i> <i>tense</i>: not, as A. V., ‘<i>hath manifested it</i>,’ but manifested it, viz. at the Creation. This is important for the right understanding of the words “<i>from the creation of the world</i>,” ver. 20. <h2><u><b>20.</b>]</u></h2> <b>For</b> (justifying the clause preceding) his invisible attributes from the time of the creation, when the manifestation was made by God, <i>are perceived</i>. <br><br><b>being understood</b> (apprehended by the mind)<b> by means of His works</b> (of creation and sustenance,—not here of moral government). The rendering of the A. V., ‘<i>being understood by the things that are made</i>, is ambiguous, being capable of conveying the sense that the things which are made, understand them. <h3><u><b>his eternal power</b>]</u></h3> To this the evidence of Creation is plainest of all: Eternal, and Almighty, have always been recognized epithets of the Creator.<h3><u><b>and divinity</b>]</u></h3> not <i>Godhead</i>: the fact that the Creator is <i>divine</i> ;—is of a <i>different nature</i> from ourselves, and accompanied by distinct attributes, and those of the highest order,—which we call <i>divine</i>. <h3><u><b>so that they are without excuse</b>]</u></h3> The words may be also, and more literally, rendered, <b>that they may be without excuse</b>. But, however true it is, that in the doings of the Allwise, <i>all results are purposed</i>,—the sense ‘<i>in order that they might be inexcusable</i>,’ would be<br><br>manifestly contrary to the whole spirit of the argument, which is bringing out, not at present <i>God’s sovereignty in dealing with man, but man’s inexcusableness in holding back the truth by unrighteousness</i>. Chrysostom says, “God has not done this for this express purpose, even though it has so turned out. For He did not put this knowledge of Himself forth in order to deprive them of all excuse, but in order that they might know Him: they, by forgetting Him, deprived themselves of all excuse.” <h2><u><b>21. because</b>]</u></h2> This assigns the reason why they were without excuse.<h3><u><b>though they knew God</b>]</u></h3> ie.‘<i>with the knowledge of Him above stated</i>? This testifies plainly that matter of <i>fact</i>, and not of <i>possibility</i>, has been the subject of the foregoing verses. From this point, we take up what they MIGHT HAVE DONE, <i>but</i> DID NOT. They glorified Him not as GOD, i.e. they did not by worship recognize Him as the great Creator of all, distinct from and infinitely superior to all His works. Bengel well divides <i>glorifying</i> and <i>giving of thanks</i>. “We are bound to give God thanks for benefits, but to glorify Him for His own divine attributes.” They <i>did neither</i>: in their <i>religion</i>, they deposed God from His place as Creator,—in their <i>lives</i>, they were ungrateful by the abuse of His gifts.<h3><u><b>their reasonings</b>]</u></h3> not, as A. V., ‘<i>imaginations</i>, which the word never signifies. It is used generally in N. T.in a bad sense: <i>they became vain</i> (idle, foolish) <b>in their speculations</b>. <h3><u><b>their heart</b>]</u></h3> the whole inner man,—the seat of knowledge and feeling,—<b>being without understanding </b>(especially in not retaining God in its knowledge) <b>became dark </b>(lost the little light it<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Y2DwZSuW2RDjKY4S_rJz9NjlneD5SsC/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

His Power and Majesty visible in the Creation, <b>for</b> is literally <b>in</b>, and represents the conditional element in which the change subsisted. <br><br><b>uncorruptible </b>and <b>corruptible</b> shew by contrast the folly of such a substitution: He who made and upholds all things must be <i>uncorruptible</i>, and <i>no corruptible thing can express His likeness</i>.<h3><u><b>an image of</b>]</u></h3> literally,<b> the similitude of the form</b>,—not of any one particular man, but <i>of man</i> (examples being abundant), to which they degraded God,—and so of the other creatures. Deities of the <i>human </i>form prevailed in Greece—those of the <i>bestial</i> in Egypt. Both methods of worship were practised in Rome. <h2><u><b>24–32.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Immorality, and indeed bestiality, were the sequel of idolatry.</i> <h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> The <b>also</b> may import, A<i>s they advanced in departure from God, so God also on His part gave them up</i>, &c.;—His dealings with<i> them </i>had a progression likewise.<h3><u><b>gave them up</b>]</u></h3> not merely permissive, but judicial: <b>God delivered them over</b>. As sin begets sin, and darkness of mind deeper darkness, grace gives place to judgment, and the divine wrath hardens men, and hurries them on to more fearful degrees of depravity.<h3><u><b>in the desires, or lusts</b>]</u></h3> not <i>by </i>nor <i>through </i>the lusts (as Erasmus and A. V.);—the lusts of the heart were the <i>field of action</i>, the department of their being, <i>in which </i>this dishonour took place.<h3><u><b>uncleanness</b>]</u></h3> more than mere profligacy in the satisfaction of natural lust; and see ver. 26, where a similar term, to <b>dishonour</b>, is used in the original:—bestiality, impurity in the<i> physical</i>, not only in the social and religious sense. <h3><u><b>to dishonour</b>]</u></h3> The infinitive mood may imply either (1) the <i>purpose</i> of God’s delivering them over to impurity, ‘<i>that their bodies should be dishonoured</i>,’ or (2) the result of that delivering over, ‘<i>so that their bodies were dishonoured</i>,’ or (3) the nature of the impurity, as below, in ver. 26,—‘<i>impurity, which consisted in their bodies being dishonoured</i>.’ The second of these seems most accordant with the usage of the Apostle and with the argument. The clause may be, and with more probability, rendered, <b>so that their bodies were dishonoured among them</b>. <h2><u><b>25.</b>]</u></h2> This verse casts light on the <i>holding back</i> (or <i>down</i>) <i>the truth in unrighteousness</i> of ver. 18. <i>The truth of God</i> (the true notion of Him as the Creator) which they professed, they changed into <i>a lie</i> (the word ‘<i>lie</i>’ is used of <i>idols</i>, Jer. xvi. 19), thus counteracting its legitimate agency, and depriving it of all power for good. The word rendered <b>worshipped</b> is used of the honour of <i>respect</i> and <i>observance</i> and <i>reverence</i>,—that rendered <b>served</b>, of <i>formal worship with sacrifice and offering</i>.<h3><u><b>the creature</b>]</u></h3> the <i>thing made</i>, a general<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d2TbbWBX32MLymlt12m3jjAPaDr7N1id/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

V.,<i> more than</i>, which would only imply that they gave to the one a <i>greater amount</i> of service than to the other.—The doxology expresses the horror of the Apostle at this dishonour, and puts their sin in a more striking light.<h2><u><b>26.</b>]</u></h2> literally, <b>passions of dishonour</b>: see above, ver. 24, stronger than <b>shameful passions</b>, as setting forth the condition to which the passions belonged.

This is further shewn by the verb <b>which was meet</b>, in the past tense. If there had been no hell, nor any punishment threatened, this alone was worse than any punishment. And if <i>even in this </i>they found pleasure, why this very pleasure was an accession of punishment.<h2><u><b>28.</b>]</u></h2> There is, in the original, a play on words in this place, which can hardly be expressed in any other language. <b>Because they reprobated the knowledge of God, God gave them over to a reprobate mind</b>, is indeed a very inadequate, but as far as the <i>form</i> of the two words is concerned, an <i>accurate </i>representation of it. Mr. Conybeare gives it—‘‘As they thought fit to cast out the acknowledgment of God, God gave them over to an outcast mind.”<br><br><b>reprobate </b>means <i>rejected by God</i>. God withdrew from them His preventing grace, and left them to the evil which they had chosen. God did <i>not </i>give them up to a mind which had, but to a mind judicially abandoned to that depravity which, being well able to exercise the faculty of discernment required, not only does not do so, but in the headlong current of its abandonment to evil, sympathizes with and encourages (ver. 32) its practice in others. It is the seeing and approving better things, which makes the <i>following worse things </i>so peculiarly criminal.<h3><u><b>they did not choose to retain</b>]</u></h3> equivalent to <i>they chose not to retain</i>: the latter would express more a <i>deliberate act of the judgment</i> ending in rejection of God, whereas the text charges them with <i>not having exercised </i>that judgment which would, if exercised, have led to the retention of God in their knowledge.<h3><u><b>to retain God in their knowledge</b>]</u></h3> So Job xxi. 14,—”they say to God, Depart from us: for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways,” and xxii. 15–17.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q7hb4gU98Vsv0ixvUWeWlErc8tTKuIFm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The Apostle can hardly have written it here, treating as he does all these immoralities of the heart and conscience as <i>results </i>of, and <i>flowing from</i>, the licentious practices of idolatry above specified.—Accurate distinctions of ethical meaning can hardly be found for all these words. Without requiring such, or insisting on each excluding the rest, I have collected the most interesting notices respecting them. <h3><u><b>unrighteousness</b>]</u></h3> Perhaps a general term, comprehending all that follow: such would be according to the usage of the Epistle: bunt perhaps to be confined to the stricter import of <b>injustice</b>: of which on the part of the Romans, history gives abundant testimonies. <h3><u><b>wickedness</b>]</u></h3> This term is interpreted to mean <i>the disposition to work evil</i>: and is used therefore more of the <i>tempter</i> and seducer to evil.<br><br><b>covetousness</b> (not as 1 Thess. iv. 6, see there), of which the whole provincial government and civil life of the Romans at the time was full. “When was the lap of avarice more widely spread?” exclaims Juvenal, soon after this.<h3><u><b>maliciousness</b>]</u></h3> The word thus rendered really means more the <i>passive side</i> <i>of evil</i>—the capability of and proclivity to evil,—the opposite to <i>virtue</i>. <h3><u><b>whisperer</b>s]</u></h3> <b>i.e. secret maligners</b>; “backbiters” indicates <i>open slanderers</i>. The word rendered “<i>haters of God</i>,” is never found in this active sense, but always in a passive, <b>hated by God</b>; and such is apparently the sense here. The order of crimes enumerated would be broken, and one of a totally different kind inserted between<i> slanderers</i> and<i> insolent</i>, if this word is to signify ‘<i>haters of God</i>.” But on the other supposition,—if any crime was known more than another as ‘<i>hated by the gods</i>,’ it was that of informers, abandoned persons who circumvented and ruined others by a system of malignant espionage and false information. And the crime was one which the readers of this part of Roman history know to have been the pest of the state; Tacitus, for example, calls the informers, “persons favoured by the Prince, but hateful to God.” It does not follow that the informers<i> only</i> are intended, but the expression may be used to include all those abandoned persons who were known as <i>hated by the gods</i>, who were employed in pursuits hateful and injurious to their kind. <h3><u><b>insolent</b>]</u></h3> The word so rendered is opposed by the Greek writers to that indicating ‘a discreet and modest man: but here perhaps, and also as said by St. Paul of himself, 1 Tim. i. 13, it designates one who is <i>insolent</i>, ‘an insulting person.’<h3><u><b>proud</b>]</u></h3> The word so rendered is said to point out one who despises others in comparison with himself. Aristotle mentions insolence and pride as examples of qualities consequent on wealth. <h3><u><b>boasters</b>]</u></h3> “One who is rash, and claims a high character for bravery,” says Aristotle of the meaning of this word; and in another place, “the <i>boaster</i> seems to be one who appropriates credit to himself, when it does not belong to him, and greater than belongs to him . All exaggeration, and excessive depreciation, belong to the character of the boaster.” <h3><u><b>without </b>(moral) <b>understanding</b>]</u></h3> See Col. i. 9.<h3><u><b>without natural affection</b>]</u></h3> Petronius says of Rome, “In this city no one brings up children, because <b>a </b>man who has heirs<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/128Y3CA6DVO53I5WLDZznF1xi0MGr80s8/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Probably “<i>death</i>” is a general term for the<i> fatal</i> consequence of sin: that such courses <i>lead to ruin</i>. The word can hardly be pressed to its exact meaning: for many of the crimes mentioned could never be visited with judicial capital punishment in this world: nor could the heathen have any definite idea of eternal spiritual death, as the penalty attached to sin; nor again, any idea of the<i> connexion </i>between sin and natural death. “Life and Death,” remarks Umbreit, “are ever set over against one another in the Old as well as in the New Testament, the one as including all good that can befall us, the other, all evil.” The description here given by the Apostle of the moral state of the heathen world should by all means be compared with that in Thucydides, at the end of his third book, of the moral state of Greece at the end of the fourth year of the Peloponnesian war. ‘The English reader will find it in Hobbes’s Translation; and a summary of it in Grote’s History of Greece, vol. vi. ch. 50, pp. 375–384. The English historian gives only the political side of the description. There is also a remarkable passage in the Apocryphal Wisdom of Solomon, ch. xiv. 22—31, the opening of which is strikingly similar to our text.<h1><u><b>CHAP II. 1–29.</b>]</u></h1> <i>Secondly</i>, THE SAME, <i>that all are guilty before God</i>, IS PROVED OF THE JEWS ALSO. And first, verses 1–11,<i> no man</i> (the practice of the Jews being hinted at)<i> must condemn another, for all alike are guilty</i>. <h2><u>1.]</u></h2> The address passes gradually to the Jews. They were the people who <i>judged</i>—who pronounced all Gentiles to be born in sin and under condemnation:—doubtless there were also proud and censorious men among the Gentiles, to whom the rebuke might apply, but these are hardly in the Apostle’s mind. This is evident by comparing the charge, “<i>thou that judgest does the same things</i>,” with verses 21–23, where the same charge is implied in a direct address to the Jew.<h3><u><b>Wherefore</b>]</u></h3> On account of this “<i>righteous judgment of God</i>,’ decreeing death against the doers of these things—FOR <i>thou doest them thyself</i>. Therefore thy setting thyself up as a judge is unjustifiable. <h3><u><b>whosoever thou art that judgest</b>]</u></h3> The Jew is not yet named, but hinted at. (see above): not in order to conciliate the Jews, but on account of the as yet purposely general form of the argument. This verse is in fact the major of a syllogism, the minor of which follows, verses 17–20, where the position here declared to be unjustifiable, is asserted to be assumed by <i>the Jew</i>. <h3><u><b>for wherein</b>]</u></h3> i.e. 'in<i> the matter in which.</i>’<h2><u><b>2. according to truth</b>]</u></h2> i.e. proceeds <b>according</b> to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ClG5_-AaCsOySgb1XKoxNmEnG6l3kcT-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

No question <i>at present</i> arises, <i>how </i>this righteousness in God’s sight <i>is to be obtained</i>—but the truth is only stated broadly at present, to be further specified by and by, when it is clearly shewn that by<i> works of the law</i> no flesh can be justified before God. The neglect to observe this has occasioned two mistakes: (1) an idea that by this passage it is proved that not faith only, but works also in some measure, justify before God; and (2) an idea that. by “<i>well-doing</i>” here is <i>meant</i> faith in Christ.

Had it been to indicate that the soul is the suffering part of the man, it should have been upon the soul of every man, or, upon every soul of men.<h3><u><b>the Jew first</b>]</u></h3> Because the Jew has so much greater advantages, and better opportunities of knowing the divine will: and, therefore, pre-eminent responsibility.<h2><u><b>10. peace</b>]</u></h2> Here in its highest and most glorious sense : see ch. 6, x. 15; John xiv. 27. <h2><u><b>11.</b>]</u></h2> This remark serves as the transition to what follows, not merely as the confirmation of what went before. As to what <i>preceded</i>, it asserts that though the Jew has had great advantages, he shall be justly judged for his use of them, not treated as a favourite of Heaven: as to what <i>follows</i>, it introduces a comparison, between him and the Gentile to shew <i>how fairly </i>he will be, for those greater advantages, regarded as<i> first</i> in responsibility.

For as many as have sinned without </b>(the) <b>law</b> (of Moses) <b>shall also perish without </b>(the) <b>law </b>(of Moses)]</u></h2> i. e. <i>it shall not appear against them in judg- ment</i>. Whether that will <i>ameliorate</i> their case, is not even hinted,—but only the <i>fact</i>, as consonant with God’s justice, stated. That this is the meaning of <i>without law</i> is clear from 1 Cor. ix. 21. That even these have sinned against<i> a law </i>is presently (ver. 14) shewn. Chrysostom says, “The Greek is judged <i>without law </i>: this implies not a more severe, but a milder judgment (this is perhaps saying too much, see above), that is, he has not the law to accuse him. This is the meaning of <i>without law</i>, that he is convicted without its condemnation, by the arguments of nature only. But the Jew is judged by the law, ie. the law also, together with nature, accusing him: for the greater care he had bestowed on him, the greater will be his penalty.” It is said, <b>shall perish</b>, the <i>result</i> of the judgment on them, rather than “<i>shall be judged</i>,” its <i>process</i>, because the absence of the law would thus seem as if it were the<i> rule by which they are to be judged</i>,—whereas it is only an <i>accident</i> of that judgment, which <i>depends on other considerations</i>.<br><br><b>under</b> (or in, as a condition of being)<b> the </b>(Mosaic) <b>law</b>; not ‘<i>a law</i>,’ which would make the sentence a truism: it is on<i> that very</i> undeniable assumption, ‘<i>that all who have had a law given shall be judged by that law</i>,’ that the Apostle constructs his argument, asserting it with to the Mosaic law in the ease of the Jews, and proving that the Gentiles have had a law given to them in the testimony of their consciences. These verses are no general assertions concerning men who have, and men who have not, a law revealed (for<i> all have one</i>), but a <i>statement of the case as concerning Jews and Gentiles</i>. It may safely be assumed that whenever the word “<i>law</i>” is used, without any further definition, in this Epistle, the law of Moses is intended by it. These last <b>shall be judged by the law</b>: for that will furnish the<i> measure</i> and <i>rule</i> by which judgment will proceed. <h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> This is to explain to the Jew the fact, that not his mere hearing of the law read in the synagogue, (which is equivalent to his being by birth and privilege a Jew,) will justify him before God, but (still keeping to general principles, and not tonehing as yet on the<i> impossibility of being thus justified</i>) the doing of the law. <h2><u><b>14.</b>]</u></h2> Now, the Apostle speaks of the <b>Gentiles</b> in general; see ch. iii. 29; xi. 13; xv. 10, 12. <h3><u><b>the law</b>]</u></h3> viz.<i> of Moses</i>. <b>A </b>law, they have; see below. <b>by nature</b>, i. e. in accordance with the promptings of their own minds.<h3><u><b>the things of the law</b>]</u></h3> i.e. the things about which the law is concerned: for example, abstain from stealing, or killing, or adultery. But it by no means follows that the Apostle means that the Gentiles could <i>fulfil</i> the law, do<i> the</i> things, i.e.<i> all </i>the things enjoined by the law: he argues that a conscientious Gentile, who knows not <i>the law</i>, does, when he acts in accordance with requirements of the law, so far set up the law to himself. The Apostle does not deny certain virtues to the Gentiles, but maintains the inefficiency of those, and all other virtues, towards man’s salvation. <br><br><b>are the law unto themselves </b>(so far), not ‘<i>a law</i>,’ for <i>a law</i> may be just or unjust, God’s law or man’s law:<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dZzyZ8Ozi61gKyY_fB_8A05OH6c441Ij/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Hardly to that just preceding, which surely speaks of a process going on<i> in this life</i> (so however Chrysostom takes it. See also a fine passage in Bourdaloue’s Sermons, vol. i. Serm. ii. p. 27, ed. Paris, 1854): nor, as commonly assumed, to the verb “<i>shall be judged</i>” (ver. 12), which only terminates one in a series of clauses connected by “<i>for</i>:”—but to <i>the great affirmation of the passage</i>, <i>concluding with ver</i>. 10. ‘To this it is bound, it appears to me, by the <b>words the secrets of men</b>, answering to “<i>every soul of man</i>,” ver.9. This affirmation is the last sentence which has been in the dogmatic form:—after it we have a series of quasi-parenthetic clauses, carrying on the reasoning by for, vv. 11, 12, 13, 14, After it, the reasons, necessitated by the startling assertion, are one after another given, and, that having been done, <i>the time is specified when the great retribution shall take place</i>. <h3><u><b>by Jesus Christ</b>]</u></h3> viz. as <i>the Judge</i>—see John v. 22:—belongs to the verb shall judge.

The address in the second person carries on the apostrophe from ver. 5, since when it has been broken off by reference to the great day of retribution and its rule of judgment; the thou identifies the person addressed here as the same indicated there, and is here emphatic, as in ver. 1. Thus the Apostle by degrees <i>sets in his place as a Jew</i> the somewhat indefinite object of his remonstrances hitherto,—and reasons with him as such. <h3><u><b>restest upon the law</b>]</u></h3> The original word is one used of <i>false </i>trust; the Septuagint version uses it where we have “y<i>et will they lean upon the Lord</i>,” Micah iii. 11. <h2><u><b>18.knowest his will</b>]</u></h2> Literally, <b>the will</b>: God having been just mentioned, it is left to be inferred that the word <b>will</b> is to be referred to Him. <br><br><b>and approvest things that are more excellent; </b>or<b>, provest</b> (in the sense of sifting and coming to a conclusion on) <b>things which differ</b>.The words may be rendered either way ; but the translation in the text is preferable: the other being somewhat flat in meaning, and not so applicable. <br><br>being (habitually, not in youth only)<b> instructed </b>(not merely catechetically but didactically, in the synagogues, &c.) out of the law.<h2><u><b>19. a guide of the blind</b>]</u></h2> We can hardly say with Olshausen, that the Apostle <i>undoubtedly</i> refers to the saying of our Lord, Matt. xv. 14,—but rather that both that saying and this were allusive to a title “leaders of the blind” given to themselves by the Pharisees, with which St.Paul as a Pharisee would be familiar. Similarly, the following titles may have been well-known and formal expressions. of Jewish pride with reference to those who were without the covenant.<h2><u><b>20. the form</b>]</u></h2> more properly, perhaps, <i>the model</i>: not the mere apparent likeness, but the <i>real representation</i>. The law, as far as it went, was a reflexion of the holi- ness and character of God. Hardly so much is here meant, as that the law <i>contained a foreshadowing of Christ</i>,—for the Apostle is speaking now more of <i>moral </i>truth and knowledge, by which a rule of. judgment is set up, sufficient to condemn the Jew as well as the Gentile.—But after all, this clause is not to be pressed as declaring a fact, but taken subjectively with regard to the Jew, after the words “<i>thou art confident</i>,” and understood of <i>his estimate</i> of the law. 21.) “And even the righteous rebuke may no longer be restrained.

Ant. xviii. 3. 4). And the mention of <i>abhorring idols</i> leads into the kind of robbery which is meant. “ Thou who abhorrest idols, dost thou rob their temples?” That it was necessary to vindicate the Jews from such a charge, appears from Acts xix. 37: and Josephus gives as a law, not to rob strange temples, nor take any offering dedicated by name to any god. <h2><u><b>23.</b>]</u></h2> ‘This question comprehends the previous ones. <h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> ‘For what is written in the prophets Isaiah and Ezekiel (see reff.), is no less true now of you:’ ‘the fact is so, as it is written.’<h2><u><b>25—29.</b>]</u></h2> Inasmuch us CIRCUMCISION was the especial sign of the covenant, and as such, a distinction on which the Jewish mind dwelt with peculiar satisfaction: the Apostle sets forth, <i>that circumcision without the keeping of the law is of no avail, and that true circumcision and true Judaism are matters of the heart, not of the flesh only</i>. “‘But,’ says the replier, ‘circumcision is a great fact.’ ‘I confess it,’ rejoins the Apostle, ‘but WHEN? When a man has that which is inward in the heart’ And see here the Apostle’s wisdom, how fittingly he has introduced his argument about it. He did not begin with it at once, since it was held in great estimation: but when he has shewn that they were offenders in a still greater matter, and were guilty of blasphemy towards God, then at length, having secured his readers’ condemnation of them, and having lowered them from their preeminence, he introduces his argument about circumcision, confident that no one ever will be found as its unlimited apologist.” Chrysostom. <h2><u><b>25. is become uncircumcision</b>]</u></h2> i.e. <i>counts for nothing</i>: the Jewish transgressor is no better off than the Gentile transgressor. <h2><u><b>26.the uncircumcision</b>]</u></h2> i.e. those who are in the state of uncircumcision. <h3><u><b>the ordinances</b>]</u></h3> Plainly the <i>moral</i> requirements, not the ceremonial : for one of the very first of the latter was, <i>to be circumcised</i>.

So that <b>the spirit</b> <i>here</i> is not man’s spirit, nor properly the Holy Spirit, but<i> the spirit</i>, as opposed to <i>the letter</i>, of the Jewish law and of all God’s revelation of Himself. <h3><u><b>whose praise</b>]</u></h3> viz. of the true Jew: the circumcision of the heart, as belonging to him, is subordinate.—The praise of such a character, (for <i>praise </i>it must be,) can only come from Him who sees in secret (Matt. vi. 4, 6), and can discern the heart. <h2><u><b>III. 1–20.</b>]</u></h2> TAKING INTO ALL FAIR ACCOUNT THE REAL ADVANTAGES OF THE JEWS, THESE CANNOT, BY THE TESTIMONY OF SCRIPTURE ITSELF CONCERNING THEM, EXEMPT THEM FROM THIS SENTENCE OF GUILTINESS BEFORE GOD, IN WHICH ALL FLESH ARE INVOLVED. <h2><u><b>1—4.</b>]</u></h2> The circumcised Jew did unquestionably possess great advantages, which were not annulled by the rebellion of some. <h2><u>1.]</u></h2> <b>then</b>, i.e. seeing that things are so.

For the word here can only mean <b>first</b>;— ‘secondly,’ &c., being to follow: not “chiefly” as A. V. and others. Compare a similar use of “<i>first</i>” without being followed by “<i>second</i>,” in ch. i. 8. <h3><u><b>the oracles of God</b>]</u></h3> These words look very like a reminiscence of Stephen’s apology, see Acts vii, 38. These oracles are not only the law of Moses, but all the revelations of God hitherto made of Himself <i>directly</i>, all of which had been entrusted to <i>Jews only</i>. By these they were received into a special covenant, which advantage is therefore included in their being entrusted with the divine oracles. <h2><u><b>3.</b>]</u></h2> And this advantage is not cancelled, nor the covenant anuulled, by their disobedience. The word does not import ‘did <i>not believe</i>,’ which certainly would be out of place here, where the Apostle is not speaking of faith or want of faith as yet, but of <i>unrighteousness</i> (ver. 5), and moral guilt. The word seems tobe used in the sense of <i>were unfaithful</i> <i>to the covenant</i>, the very condition of which was to walk in the ways of the Lord and observe his statutes. <h3><u><b>shall their unfaithfulness make void</b> (cancel, nullify) <b>the faithfulness of God?</b>]</u></h3> ‘Because they have broken faith on their part, shall God break faith also on His ?’ <h2><u><b>4. God forbid</b>]</u></h2> literally, <b>let it not be</b>: see reff. The Apostle uses this expression of pious horror, when he has supposed or mentioned any thing by which the honour, truth, or jus.ice of God would be compromised, as here by His covenant-word being broken.<h3><u><b>nay, let God be true</b>]</u></h3> i.e. ‘rather let us believe all men on earth to have broken their word and truth, than God His. Whatever becomes of men and their truth, <i>His truth must stand fast</i>.—The citation which follows goes to the depth of the matter. It is the penitent confession of a sinner, that be is sensible how entirely <i>against God </i>his sin has been, and how clearly his own unworthiness sets God’s judgment against sin vindicated before him. And to this meaning the objection in the next verse is addressed,— see below. <b>That thou mightest be justified</b> (shewn to be just) <b>in thy words (sentences, words of judgment), and mightest overcome when thou art judged </b>(the Psalm has, “<i>in thy judging</i>;” but here the verb is passive), i.e. ‘when Thy dealings are called in question by men.’ <h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2> In the citation, the penitent regarded his sin as having been the instrument of bringing out God’s justice into clearer light. On the abuse which might be made of such a view, the Apostle founds another question:—‘It would almost seem as if God would be unjust in inflicting His wrath (the consequences of His wrath) on men whose very impiety has been the means whereby His own righteousness has been shewn forth, and established.’ <h3><u><b>our unrighteousness</b>]</u></h3> viz. that ‘of<i> the Jews</i>,’ not ‘of all men,’ for only to the Jews can ver. 7 apply. <h3><u><b>the righteousness of God</b>]</u></h3> viz. that established by the fact of His being justified, as in ver. 4.<h3><u><b>I speak as a man</b>]</u></h3> Said, as elsewhere by St. Paul, to excuse a supposition bearing with it an aspect of inconsistency or <i>impiety</i>:—not implying that he speaks<i> in </i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UI8QKYqvmrEAnLMdiGTUWGca7yhPbqdk/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

He will shew that God is not (the God) of Jews alone, but of Gentiles, and that <i>this very point was involved in the promise </i>made to Abraham, <i>by believing which he was justified </i>(ch. iv.), and therefore that it lies in the<i> very root and kernel of the law itself</i>. But, as often elsewhere, he passes off from this idea again and again, recurring to it however continually,—and eventually when he brings forward his proof text (in chap. iv. 17), <i>Abraham's faith</i>, and <i>not this fact</i>, has become the leading subject.<h2><u><b>30. seeing that</b>]</u></h2> literally, <b>if at least</b> (if we are to hold to what is manifest as a result of our former argument) <b>God is one, which shall justify the circumcision </b>(literally, the Jews, after the analogy of chap. ii. 26) <b>by </b>(<b>out of</b>, as the preliminary condition,—the state <i>out of which</i> the justification arises) f<b>aith, and the uncircumcision</b> (the Gentiles)<b> through </b>(by means of their) <b>faith</b>. Too much stress must not be laid on the difference of the two prepositions (see ver. 22 and note). The former expresses the <i>ground</i> of justification, generally taken, <i>by</i>, or<i> out of faith</i>: the latter the <i>means</i> whereby the man lays hold on justification, <i>by his faith</i>: the former is the objective ground, the latter the subjective medium. <h2><u><b>31.</b>]</u></h2> But again the Jew may object, if this is the case, if Faith be the <i>ground</i>, and Faith the <i>medium</i>, of justification for all, circumcised or uncircumcised, <i>surely the law is set aside and made void</i>. That this is not so, the Apostle both here asserts, and is prepared to shew by working out the proposition of ver. 29, that the law itself belonged to a covenant whose <i>original recipient was justified by faith</i>, and whose main promise was, the <i>reception and blessing of the Gentiles</i>. <h3><u><b>the law]</u></h3></b> i.e. the law of Moses, as every where in the Epistle. We may safely say that the Apostle never argues of <i>law</i>, abstract, in the sense of a system of precepts,—its attributes or its effects,— but always of THE LAW, concrete,—<i>the law of God given by Moses</i>, when speaking of the Jews, as here: <i>the law of God</i>, in as far as written in their consciences, when speaking of the Gentiles: and when including both, <i>the law of God generally</i>, His written as well as His unwritten will.—Many Commentators have taken this verse (being misled in some eases by its place at the end of the chapter) as standing by itself, and have gone into the abstract grounds why faith, does not make void the law (or moral obedience) ; which, however true, <i>have no place here</i>: the design being to shew that the law itself<i> contained this very doctrine</i>, and was founded in the promise to Abraham on a covenant embracing Jews and Gentiles,—and therefore was not degraded from its dignity by the doctrine, but rather established as a part of God’s dealings,—consistent with, explaining, and explained by, the Gospel. <h2><u><b>IV. 1–5.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Abraham himself was justified by faith</i>.—The reading and punctuation of this verse present some difficulties. Ax to the former, I may remark that the verb <b>hath found</b> is omitted by our oldest MS. authority, and placed variously by others. Omitting it, the sentence will stand, “<i>What shall we say then concerning Abraham, our father as pertaining to the flesh?</i>” If the verb be retained, the punctuation may be, “<i>What shall we say then? that Abraham, our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found</i>” (righteousness, or some advantage over Gentiles) ? This has been adopted by Grotius and others of some authority. Another mode, slightly differing, may be, “<i>What then? shall we say, that</i>,” &c. But as Tholuck well remarks, both these methods of punctuating would presuppose that St. Paul had appeared to give some reason in the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KrSzEejRnsnOrHNeZ-66g9MmgrEwRW6-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

What then</b>]</u></h2> The Apostle is here contending with those under the law <i>from their own standing-point </i>: and he follows up his assertion that his argument <i>established the law</i>, by <b>what therefore</b> (‘this being conceded,’ ‘seeing that you and I are both upholders of the law’) <b>shall we</b> say, &c. This verse, and the argument following, are not a<i> proof</i>, but a<i> consequence</i>, of<i> we establish the law</i>, and are therefore introduced, not with <i>for</i>, but with <b>then</b> or <b>therefore</b>. <h3><u><b>hath found</b>]</u></h3> viz. <i>towards his justification</i>, or more strictly, <i>earned</i> as his own, to boast of The clause, <b>as pertaining to the flesh</b>, belongs to the verb <b>hath found</b>, not to the appellation “<i>our father</i>”? I have, in order to make this clear, transposed them. For the course and spirit of the argument is not to limit the paternity of Abraham to a mere fleshly one, but to shew that he was the spiritual father of all believers. And the question is not one which requires any such distinction between his fleshly and spiritual paternity (as in ch. ix. 3,5). his being so, w<i>hat do the words</i> <b>as pertaining to the flesh</b> <i>mean?</i> They cannot allude to <i>circumcision</i>; for that is rendered improbable, not only by the parallel expression “<i>by works</i>” (ver. 2) in the <i>plural</i>, but also by the consideration, that circumcision was no <i>work</i> at all, but a <i>seal of the righteousness which he had by faith</i> being yet uncircumcised (ver. 11),—and by the whole course of the argument in the present place, which is not to disprove the exclusive privilege of the Jew (that having been already done, chapters ii. iii.), but to shew that <i>the father and head of the race himself was justified not by works but by faith</i>. Doubtless, in so far as circumcision was a mere <i>work of obedience</i>, it might be in a loose way considered as falling under that category: but it came <i>after</i> justification, and so is <i>chronologically </i>here excluded. <br><br><b>As pertaining to the flesh </b>then is in contrast to <i>as pertaining to the spirit</i>,—and refers to <i>that department of our being from which spring works</i>, in contrast with <i>that in which is the exercise of faith</i>: see ch. viii. 4, 5.<h2><u><b>2.</b>]</u></h2><b> For if Abraham was justified</b> (not, ‘were justified,’ as in A. V.: it is assumed, asa fact known to all, that he <i>was justified</i> by some means) <b>by works, he hath ground of boasting </b>(not expressed here whether <i>in the sight of men, </i>or<i> of God</i>, but taken generally : the proposition being assumed, ‘He that has earned justification by works, has whereof to <i>boast</i>’). Then in disproof of this,—that Abraham has matter of boasting,—whatever<i> men</i> might think of him, or attribute to him (for example, the perfect keeping of the law, as the Jews did), one thing at least is clear, <i>that he has none before </i>(in the .presence of)<i> God</i>. This we can prove (ver. 3), <b>for what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God</b> (God’s promise),<b> and it </b>(<b>his believing</b>)<b> was reckoned unto him for </b>(ch.ii.26) <b>righteousness</b>.—The whole question so much mooted between Protestants on the one hand, and Romanists, Arminians, and Sovinians on the other, as to whether this righteousness was reckoned (1)<i> by means of faith</i>, being <i>God's righteousness imputed </i>to the sinner; or (2) <i>on account of faith</i>, so that God made Abraham <i>righteous on account of the merit of his faith</i>, lies in fact in a small compass, if what has gone before be properly taken into account. The Apostle has proved Jews and Gentiles to be <i>all under sin</i>: utterly unable by works of their own to attain to righteousness. Now <i>faith</i>, in the second sense mentioned above, is strictly and entirely<i> a work</i>, and as such would be the <i>efficient cause</i> of man’s justification,—which, by what has preceded, <i>it cannot be</i>. It will therefore follow, that it was not the <i>act of believing</i> which was reckoned to him as a righteous act, or on account of which perfect righteousness was laid to his charge, but that the <i>fact of his trusting God to perform His promise introduced kim into the blessing promised</i>. God declared his purpose (Gen.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19J_r6yoZSbErQ1UsbMU4L-XaHffo4iph/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But this bless- ing was, <i>justification by faith in Christ</i>. Now Abraham could not, in the strict ‘sense of the words, be justified by faith <i>in Christ</i>,—nor is it necessary to suppose that he directed his faith forward to the promised Redeemer in Person; but in so far as God’s gracious purpose was revealed to him, he grasped it by faith, and that righteousness which was implied, so far, in it, was imputed to him, Some have said (for example, Tholuck) that the parallel is incomplete—Abraham’s <i>faith</i> having been reckoned to him for righteousness, whereas, in our case,<i> the righteousness of Christ</i> reckoned to us as our righteousness, <i>by</i> faith. But the incompleteness lies in the nature of the respective cases. In his case, the <i>righteousness itself</i> was not yet manifested. He believed <i>implicitly</i>, taking the <i>promise, with all it involved and implied, as true</i>. This then was his way of entering into the promise, and by means of his faith was bestowed upon him that full justification which that faith never apprehended. Thus <i>his faith itself</i>, the mere fact of implicit trust in God, was counted to<i> him </i>for righteousness. But though <i>the same righteousness</i> is imputed to us who believe, and by means of faith also, it is no longer the mere fact of believing implicitly in God’s truth, but the reception of <i>Christ Jesus the Lord </i>by faith, which justifies us (see verses 23–25 and note). As it was then the realization of God’s words by faith, so now: but <i>we</i> have the <i>Person of the Lord Jesus for the object of faith</i>, explicitly revealed:<i> he had not</i>. In both cases justification is <i>gratuitous</i>, and is <i>by faith</i>: and so far, which is as far as the argument here requires, the parallel is strict and complete.<h2><u><b>4. to him that worketh</b> (him that works “for hire, that earns wages), <b>his reward is not reckoned in the way of </b>(as a matter of) <b>grace</b> (favour), <b>but of </b>(as a matter of) <b>debt</b>]</u></h2> The sentence is a <i>general</i> one, not with any peculiar reference to Abraham,—except <i>that after the words <b>in the way of</b><b> </b><b>grace</b> we may supply “</i>as it was to Abraham,” if we will; for this is evidently assumed. <h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2> <b>but to him that worketh not </b>(for hire,—is not a<i> workman </i>looking for his <i>wages</i>), <b>but believeth</b> <b>on </b>(casts himself in simple trust and humility on) <b>him who justifieth </b>(accounts just, as in ver. 3) <b>the ungodly </b>(‘<i>impious</i>:’ stronger than ‘unrighteous ’—no allusion to Abraham’s having formerly been in idolatry,—for the sentence following on ver. 4, which is <i>general</i> and of universal application, <i>must also be general,—including of course </i>Abraham: <i>impiousness</i> is the state of all men by nature),—<b>his faith is reckoned for righteousness</b>.—B<i>y way of grace </i>is of course implied. <h2><u><b>6—8.</b>]</u></h2><i> The same is confirmed by a passage from David</i>. This is not a fresh example, but a confirmation of the assertion involved in ver. 5, that a man may believe on Him who justifies the ungodly, and have his faith reckoned for righteousness. The applicability of the text depends on the persons alluded to <i>being sinners, and having sin not reckoned to them</i>. The Psalm, strictly speaking, says nothing of the imputation of <i>righteousness</i>,—but it is implied by St. Paul, that the <i>remission of sin is equivalent to the imputation of righteousness</i>—that there is <i>no negative state of innocence</i>—none intermediate between acceptance for righteousness, and rejection for sin.<h2><u><b>6.</b>]</u></h2> literally, <b>pronounces the blessedness</b>, ‘<i>the congratulation</i>’ in allusion perhaps to the Heb. form, ‘(O) the blessings of? ...—<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qO72lRfL8ettdYT7lJCGXQyTBQbHyHIk/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But the triumph and recognition of that faith whereby he was constituted so, was not during his circumcision, but during his uncircumcision:—therefore <i>the faithful, his descendants, must not be confined to the circumcised, but must take in the uncircumcised also</i>.—On the appellation father in this sense, Tholuck compares the expression Gen. iv. 20; 1 Macc. ii. 54, “<i>Phinees, our father in being zealous and fervent</i>,” and a saying of Maimonides, “Moses is the father of all the prophets who succeeded him.” See also our Lord’s saying, John viii. 37, 39. One of the Rabbinical books has a sentiment remarkably coincident with that in our text: “Abraham is the father of all those who follow his faith.” <h3><u><b>that the righteousness might be reckoned unto them also]</u></h3></b> This is in <i>fact</i> parenthetical, whether brackets are used or not; for otherwise the construction from the former to the latter word <b>the father</b> would not proceed. <b>The righteousness</b>, namely, that which Abraham’s faith was reckoned as being,—the righteousness of God, then hidden though imputed, but now revealed in Jesus Christ.<h2><u><b>12.</b>]</u></h2> <b>and </b>[<b>that he might be</b>]<b> father of the circumcision</b> (the circumcised)<b> to them</b> (‘for those,’ ‘in the case of those’) <b>who are not only</b> (physically) <b>of the circumcision, but to them also who walk in the steps of the faith of our father </b>(speaking here as a Jew) <b>Abraham </b>(which he had) <b>while in uncircumcision</b>.<h2><u><b>13 —17.</b>]</u></h2><i> Not through the</i> LAW, <i>but through</i> THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF FAITH, was THE INHERITANCE OF THE WORLD <i>promised to Abraham: so that not only they who are of the law, but they who follow Abraham's faith are</i> HEIRS OF THIS PROMISE.<h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> The argumentation is an expansion of the expression “<i>father of all that believe</i>” above. If these believers are Abraham’s seed, then his promised inheritance is <i>theirs</i>. <h3><u><b>through the law</b>]</u></h3> not, ‘<i>under the law</i>,’—nor, ‘<i>by works of the l</i>aw—nor, ‘<i>by the righteousness of the law</i>:’ but, <b>through the law</b>, so that the law should be the <i>ground</i>, or <i>efficient cause</i>, or medium, of the promise. None of these it was, as matter of historical fact.—<b>For not through the law was the promise </b>(made) <b>to Abraham, or to his seed, viz. that he should he heir of the world, but by the righteousness of faith</b>. This specification of the promise has perplexed most of the commentators. The actual promise, Gen. (xii, 2, 3) xiii, 14–17; xv. 18; xvii. 8, was the possession of the <i>land of Canaan</i>. But the Rabbis already had seen, and St. Paul, who had been brought up in their learning, held fast the truth,—that much more was intended in the words which accompany this promise, “In thee (or in thy seed) shall all families of the earth be blessed,” than the mere possession of Canaan. They distinctly trace the gift of the world to Abraham to <i>this promise</i>, not to the foregoing. They say, “The garden is the world, which God delivered to Abraham, to whom it was said, ‘<i>And thou shalt be a blessing</i>” The <i>inheritance of the world </i>then is not the possession of Canaan merely, either <i>literally</i>, or<br><h2>MISSING PAGES: Volume 2, Part 1, Romans, Pages 186-286 missing.</h2><br><h1>Book: 1 Corinthians</h1><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B8UaP2o2cd3wdds4l6StE9iUE1KBf66u/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In Gal. i. 1 we have this much more strongly asserted. But they have a refer- ence to Paul himself also: “as they point in their aspect of authority, towards the churches, so, in their aspect of a humble and earnest mind, they come from Paul himself,” says Bengel. Chrysostom, referring the words to called, says, “ Because it was His will we were called, not because we were worthy.” <b>Sosthenes</b> can hardly be assumed to be identical with the ruler of the synagogue in Acts xviii. 17: see note there. He must have been some Christian well known to the church at Corinth. Thus Paul associates with himself Silvanus and Timotheus in the Epistles to the Thessalonians: and Timo- theus in 2 Cor. Chrysostom attributes it to modesty, that he associates with himself one by far his inferior. Some have sup- posed Sosthenes to be the <i>writer </i>(i.e. the amanuensis) of the Epistle, see Rom. xvi. 22. Possibly he may have been one of the household of Chloe (ver. 11) through whom the intelligence had been received, and the Apostle may have associated him with himself as approving the appeal to apos- tolic authority. Perhaps some slight may<h2><u>have been put upon him by the parties at Corinth, and for that reason St. Paul puts him forward. our brother as 2 Cor. i. 1, of Timothy. 2.]</u></h2> On the words <b>the church of God which is at Corinth</b>, Calvin remarks; “It may perhaps seem strange that he should call by the name of the Church of God that assembly of men among whom so many corruptions were rife, that Satan seemed to reign there rather than God. And it is certain that he had no design of flattering the Corinth- ians; for he speaks by the Spirit of God, who does not use flattery. Yet, among so many defilements, what kind of an appear- ance of a Church can any longer be found ? I answer, that, however many vices had crept in, however many corruptions of doc- trine and of morals, there were yet some signs of a true Church. This passage is carefully to be noted, to keep us from requiring in this world a Church without any spot or wrinkle; or refusing this title to any assembly in which all is not accord- ing to our wish. For this is a dangerous temptation, to think that there is no Church, unless where there appears per- fect purity. For whoever persuades him- self of this, will at length find it necessary to separate off from all other men, and give himself out for the only holy man in the world, or else to found a peculiar sect<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Z0R8uGrTSvXu1Rzx7lhSGqps7YRM83y/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

If we ask what cause had St. Paul to recognize the Church at Corinth? the answer is, because he saw among them the doctrine of the Gospel, Baptism, the Supper of the Lord; symbols by which the Church ought to be discerned.” On the words of God, Chrysostom remarks, “not of this man and of that man, but of God,” taking the expression as addressed to the Corinthians to remind them of their position as a congregation belonging to GOD, and <i>not to any head of a party. </i>Perhaps this is too refined, the words “<i>the Church of God</i>” being so usual with St. Paul,—see references. <b>sanctified in Christ Jesus</b>]</u></h3> (i.e. hallowed, dedicated) <b>to God in</b> (in union with and by means of) <b>Jesus Christ.</b> See Rom. i. 7, note. c<b>alled [to be] saints, with all, &c.]</b> These words do not belong to the designations just preceding, ‘<i>as are all</i>, &c., but form part of the address of the Epistle, so that these all are partakers with the Corinth- ians in it. They form a weighty and pre- cious addition,—made here doubtless to shew the Corinthians, that membership of God's Holy Catholic Church consisted not in being planted, or presided over by Paul, Apollos, or Cephas (or their successors), but in <i>calling on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</i> The Church of England has adopted from this verse her solemn ex- planation of the term, in the ‘Prayer for all sorts and conditions of men:’ “ More especially, we pray for the good estate of <i>the Catholic Church</i>: that it may be so guided and governed by thy good Spirit, that <i>all who profess and call themselves</i> <i>Christians </i>may be led into the way of truth, and hold the faith in unity of spirit, in the bond of peace, and in righteousness of<h2><u>life.” The phrase “<i>to call upon the name of the Lord,</i>” was one adopted from the Old Test.: see Joel ii. 32; the adjunct our <b>Lord Jesus Christ</b>, defines that Lord (Je- hovah) on whom the Christians called, to be Jesus Christ,—and is a direct testi- mony to the divine worship of Jesus Christ, as universal in the Church. <b>in every place, both their’s</b> (in their country, wherever that may be) <b>and our’s.</b> This connexion is far better than to join <b>both their’s and our’s</b> with <b>Lord</b>, thereby making the first our superfluous. <b>their’s</b>, refers <i>to the all that call,</i> &e., <b>our’s </b>to Paul, and Sosthenes, and those whom he is addressing. 3.]</u></h2> See Rom. i. 7, note.

Such persons would contend for his apostolic authority, and maintain doc- trinally his teaching, <i>so far being right</i>; but, as usual with partisans, would magnify into importance practices and sayings of his which were in themselves indifferent, and forget that theirs was a service of per- fect freedom under one Master, even Christ. With these he does not deal <i>doctrinally </i>in the Epistle, as there was <i>no need for it:</i> but involves them in the same censure as the rest, and shews them in ch. ii., iii., iv. that he had no such purpose of gaining per- sonal honor among them, but only of build- ing them up in Christ. <b>I of Apollos</b>] Apollos (Acts xviii. 24, ff.) had come to Corinth after the departure of Paul, and being eloquent, might attract some, to whom the bodily presence of Paul seemed weak and his speech contemptible. It would certainly appear that some occasion had been taken by this difference, to set too high a value on external and rhetorical form of putting forth the gospel of Christ. This the Apostle seems to be blaming (in part) in the conclusion of this, and the next chapter. And from ch. xvi. 12, it would seem likely that Apollos himself had been aware of the abuse of his manner of teach- ing which had taken place, and was un- willing, by repeating his visit just then, to sanction or increase it. <b>I of Cephas</b>] All we can say in possible explanation of this is, that as Peter was the <i>Apostle of the circumcision</i>,—as we know from Gal. ii. 11 ff. that his course of action on one occa- sion was reprehended by Paul, and as that course of action no doubt had influence and found followers, it is very conceivable that some of those who in Corinth lightly es- teemed Paul, might take advantage of this honored name, and cite against the Chris- tian liberty taught by their own spiritual founder, the stricter practice of Peter.

The last clause is important as against those who maintain the <i>absolute omni- science</i> of the inspired writers on <i>every topic which they handle</i>. <b>17</b>.] This verse forms the transition to the descrip- tion of his preaching among them. His mission was <i>not to baptize </i>:—a trace al- ready, of the separation of the offices of baptizing and preaching.

According to ver. 12, the knowledge of the blessings of salvation, of the glory which accompanies the kingdom of God, belongs to this higher species of teaching. Examples of it are found in the Epistle to the Romans, in the setting forth of the doctrine of justification ,—of the contrast between Christ and Adam,—of predestination (compare the word <i>‘mystery</i>,’ Rom. xi. 25), and in the Epistles to the Eph. and Col. (where the word <i>‘mystery’ </i>often occurs) in the declarations respecting the divine plan of Redemption and the Person of Christ ; nay, in our Epistle, ch. xv.

They comprehend <i>all in estimation and power</i>, Jewish or Gentile. Chrysostom says, “ By <i>rulers of the world</i> here he does not mean any spiritual beings, as some say: but those in estimation, those in power, those who think worldly matters worth contending for, philosophers and rhetoricians and authors: for these men have often ruled, and proved demagogues.” <b>who are coming</b> (more literally, <b>being brought</b>) <b>to nought</b>, viz. by God making choice of the weak and despised, and passing over them, ch. i. 28: not said of <i>their transitoriness generally</i>,—nor of <i>their power being annihilated at the coming of Christ</i>,—nor <i>of their having </i>indeed crucified Christ, but of their being brought to nought <i>by His Resurrection and the increase of His Church</i>. <h2><u><b>7.]</u></h2></b> But we speak GOD’s <b>wisdom </b>(emphasis on the word <b>God’s</b>:—the wisdom which <i>God </i>possesses- and has revealed) <b>in a mystery</b> (i.e, as handling a mystery, dealing with a mystery.

Jerome believes the words to be those of Isa. lxiv. 4, paraphrased.—I own that probability- seems to me to incline to Jerome’s view, especially when we remember, how freely St. Paul is in the habit of citing. The words of Isa. Ixiv. 4, are quite as near to the general sense of the citation as is the case in many other instances, and the words <b>have not entered into the heart of man </b>may well be a reminiscence from Isa.

At the same time, such accommodation is legitimate <i>in so far as each man is a teacher and builder of himself</i>. (5) That the various materials specified must not be fancifully pressed to indicate <i>particular doctrines or graces</i>, as e.g. Schrader (in his life of St. Paul) has done, “Some build with the gold of faith, with the silver of hope, with the imperishable costly stones of love,—others again with the dead wood of unfruitfulness in good works, with the empty straw of a spiritless, ostentatious knowledge, and with the bending reed of a continually-doubting spirit.” This, however ingenious, is beside the mark, not being justified by any indications furnished in our Epistle itself. <h3><u><b>costly stones]</u></h3></b> Not, <i>precious stones</i>, as commonly under- stood, i.e. ‘gems,’ but ‘costly stones,’ as marbles, porphyry, jasper, &c.: compare 1 Kings vii. 9 ff—<b>By the wood, hay, straw</b>, he indicates the various perversions of true doctrine, and admixtures of false philosophy which were current: so Estius, “not heretical and pernicious doctrine, for such would destroy the foundation: but that which wanted purity and solidity : as for example that which was too much mingled with human and philosophical or even Jewish opinions: that which was more curious than useful: that which occupied Christian men’s minds with vain amusement.” <h2><u><b>13.]</u></h2> The work of each man</b> (i.e. that which he has built: <i>his part</i> in erecting the building of God) <b>shall</b> (at some time) <b>be made manifest</b> (shall not always remain in the present uncertainty but be tested, and shewn of what: sort it is): <b>for the day shall declare it</b> (the <i>day of the Lord</i>: so most Commentators ancient and modern. The other interpretations are (1) ‘<i>the day of the destruction of Jerusalem</i>, which shall shew the vanity of Judaizing doctrines: but this is against both the context, and our Apostle’s habit of speaking, and goes on the assumption, that nothing but Jewish errors are spoken of.—(2) ‘<i>the lapse of time</i>, as in the Latin proverb (“<i>the day shall teach”</i>), which is still more inconsistent with the context, which necessitates a definite <i>day</i>, and a definite fire:—(3) ‘<i>the light of day</i>,’ i.e. of clear knowledge, as opposed to the present time of obscurity and night :—but the fire here is not a <i>light-giving</i>, but a <i>consuming</i> flame: and, as Meyer remarks, even in that case the “<i>day</i>” would be that of Christ’s appearing, see Rom. xiii. 12:—(4) “<i>the day of tribulation</i>:’—so Augustine : but this again is not definite enough: the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rLrIIm0xU7auPEOXDp1utYwnoJ-6S3D3/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This <i>universality </i>of trial by fire is equally against the idea of a <i>purgatorial</i> <i>fire</i>, which most convenient and lucrative fiction has been mainly based by the Romanists on a perversion of this passage. Their own Commentators are divided on the question whether there is any allusion to it in this passage); <b>and each man’s work, of what sort it is, the fire itself shall prove (the fire itself</b>, of its own power, being a <i>consuming </i>fire). <h2><u><b>14.]</u></h2> If any man’s work shall endure</b> (i.e. stand the fire,—being of inconsumable materials) <b>which he built on the foundation,—he shall receive wages</b> (as a builder;—i.e. ‘shall be rewarded for his faithful and effectual work as a teacher’): <b>15.]</b> <b>if any man’s work shall be burned up</b> (i. e. consist of such materials as the fire will destroy: Stanley adds, “It is possible that this whole image, as addressed to the Corinthians, may have been suggested, or at least illustrated, by the conflagration of Corinth under Mummius: the stately temples [one of them remaining to this day] left standing amidst the universal crash and destruction of the meaner buildings”), <b>he shall suffer loss</b> (literally, <b>be</b> <b>mulcted</b>, viz. of the wages which would otherwise have been his): <b>but he himself shall be saved</b> (having held, and built on, the true foundation Jesus Christ, he shall not be excluded from that salvation which is the free gift of God to all who believe on Christ, but shall get no <i>especial reward </i>as a faithful and effectual teacher. Compare 2 John 8, “ <i>Look to yourselves that we lose not the things which we have wrought, but receive full wages</i>:” so literally. Meyer remarks, that our Lord hints at such persons under the name of “ the last,” Matt. xx. 16: Mark x. 31), <b>yet so as through fire</b> :—i.e. as a builder whose building was consumed would escape with personal safety, but with the loss of his work.—Chrysostom, and others of the ancients, strangely understand it, that he shall not be consumed like his works, but shall be saved from this, and burnt for ever in the fire of Hell, unconsumed. But (1) <i>the fire of Hell</i> is quite alien from the context (see above),—and (2) the meaning <i>thus </i>given to <i>being saved</i> is unexampled,—and least of all could be intended where the coming of the Lord is spoken of: compare among other places, ch. v. 5. Grotius and others explain the words as a proverb, ‘<i>as out of a fire</i>, i.e. ‘with difficulty.’ But this is needless here, as the <i>figure itself</i> is that of a fire. The whole imagery of the passage will be best understood by carefully keep- ing in mind the <i>key</i>, which is to be found in the words <i>God’s building</i>, and the <i>temple of God</i>, as connected with the prophecy of Malachi iii. 1—3 and iv. 1. The Lord thus coming to His temple in flaming fire, all the parts of the building which will not stand that fire will be consumed the builders of them will escape with personal salvation, but with the loss of their work, through the midst of the conflagration.<h2><u><b>16—23.]</u></h2> THE FIGURE IS TAKEN UP </b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JTyhLn8nTGTvyofmP3Vx9jRLLECZUNpv/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

So there would be, not many temples, but many churches, each of which is, ideally, the same temple of God.” And, we may add, if the figure is to be strictly justified in its widest acceptation, that all the churches are built together into one vast temple: compare Eph. ii. 22. <h2><u><b>17.]</u></h2></b> <b>destroyeth, or, marreth</b>, whether as re- gards its <i>unity and beauty</i>, or its <i>purity and sanctity</i>: here, the meaning is left indefinite, but the latter particulars are certainly hinted at,—by the word holy, below. <br><br><b>shall God destroy</b>, or, <b>mar</b>, either by <i>temporal death</i>, as in ch, xi. 30; or by <i>spiritual death</i>, which is more probable seeing that the <i>figurative </i>temple is spoken of, not the material temple :— and as <i>temporal death</i> was the punishment for defiling the material temple (Exod. xxviii. 43.

But in the words, <b>stewards of the mysteries of God</b>, we have a new figure introduced. The Church, 1 Tim. ili. 15, is the “<i>house of God</i>,”—and those appointed to minister in it are <i>stewards</i> and <i>dispensers </i>of the property and stores of the <i>Master of the house</i>. These last are the mysteries, hidden treasures, of God,— i. e. the riches of his grace, <i>now manifested</i> in Christ, ch. ii. 7; Rom. xvi. 25, 26, which <i>they </i>announce and distribute to all, having received them from the Spirit for that purpose. “These mysteries are those of the Incarnation, Passion, and Resurrection of Christ, of our Redemption, of the calling of the Gentiles, and the rest which is included in Evangelical doctrine.” Estius: who also, as a Romanist, attempts to include the <i>sacraments </i>among the mysteries in this sense. The best refutation of this is given by himself: “Since Paul himself has said in the first chapter, Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, it is more correct to understand by these mysteries of God the doctrines of our faith.’ It may be doubted, whether, <i>in the</i> New Test. <i>sense </i>of <b>mysteries</b>, the sacraments can be in any way reckoned as such: for the word signifies a (usually <i>divine) proceeding, once hidden, but now revealed, or now hidden, and to be re- vealed</i> ; under neither of which categories can the sacraments be classed.<h2><u><b>2.]</u></h2> Moreover it is required in</b> (the case of) <b>stewards </b>(literally, <b>it is sought for</b>: <i>enquiry is made</i> in the case of stewards) <b>here [on earth] (here [on earth] </b>is emphatic and points to what follows, that though in the case of stewards enquiry was necessarily made <i>here below,</i> yet he, God’s steward, awaited no such enquiry from the day of man’s judgment, but one at the coming of the Lord) <b>that a man be</b> found (proved to be) <b>faithful </b>(emphatic).<h2><u><b>3.]</u></h2> But to me</b> (contrast to the case of the stewards into whose faithfulness enquiry is made here on earth) <b>it is (amounts to) a very small thing,—very little,—that I should be judged</b> (enquired into, as to my faithfulness) <b>by you, or by (literally) the day of man, i.e. of man’s judgment</b> (in reference to <b>here</b> above, and contrast to the day of the Lord, to which his appeal is presently made, ver. 5, and of which, as testing the worth of the labour of teachers, he spoke so fully ch. iii, 13—15), <b>nay, I do not even judge</b> (hold not an enquiry on: literally, ‘<i>but neither do I</i>,’ &c.) <b>myself</b>:<h2><u><b>4.]</u></h2> for I know nothing against myself</b> (the A.

Any interpretation which stops short of the full meaning of the words as applied to the triumphant final state (<i>explaining them of Knowledge, of security, of the lordship of one sect over another</i>), misses the force of the irony, and the meaning of the latter part of the verse. <h3><u><b>without us]</u></h3> </b>or, apart from us: ‘because <i>we</i>, as your fathers in Christ, have ever looked forward to <i>present you</i>, as our glory and joy, in that day.’—There is an exquisite delicacy of irony, which Chrysostom has well caught: “He shews their unreasonableness and their exceeding folly.

Perhaps after all, it refers merely to the peculiar heinousness of the kind of offence: compare “<i>such fornication</i>,” in ver. 1. <h2><u><b>4.]</u></h2></b> ‘This sentence stands thus: In the name of our Lord Jesus belongs to the clause to <b>deliver such an one</b>, <b>&c.</b>, that which intervenes being parenthetical <b>(when ye have been assembled together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus)</b>. <br><br><b>my spirit,</b> i.e. ‘<b>I</b> myself, in spirit, endowed by our Lord Jesus with apostolic power:’ and then the words <b>with the power of</b> our <b>Lord Jesus Christ</b> belong to <b>my spirit</b>, and are not to be taken as indicating a mere element in the assembly. <i>What does the sentence here prescribed import</i>?

Commentators have endeavoured to assign a definite purpose to this opening of the Epistle.—De Wette thinks that Paul had <i>no </i>definite purpose, except to pour out the thankfulness of his heart, and to begin by placing himself with his readers in a position of religious feeling and principle far above all discord and dissension. But I cannot agree with this. His purpose shews so plainly through the whole latter part of the chapter, that it is only consistent with verses 12—24 to find it beginning to be introduced here also. I believe that Chrysostom has given the right account: “The not coming annoyed and discomposed them, especially as he had promised he would come, but had spent all the time in Macedonia, and seemed to have preferred others to them. For this cause, knowing the feeling against him on this matter, he tells them the cause of his not coming.

This however will not explain all places where it occurs elsewhere: e.g. 1 Thess. ii. 18, <i>“We would have come to you, even I Paul, once and again,”</i>—where see note. So that after all perhaps it is best to regard it merely as an idiomatic way of speaking, when often only the singular is intended.<h3><u><b>that we may be able]</u></h3> </b>“The Apostle lived not for himself, but for the Church: so that whatever grace God conferred on him, he thought given not for himself alone, but to enable him the better to help others.” Calvin.<h2><u> <b>5.]</u></h2></b> ‘As He is, so are we in this world:’ 1 John iv. 17. <br><br><b>as the sufferings of Christ</b> (<i>endured by</i> Christ, whether in his own person, or in his mystical body, the Church, see Matt. xxv. 40, 45) <b>abound towards us </b>(i.e.<i> in our case, </i>see reff.), <b>even so through Christ our consolation also aboundeth.</b>—The form of expression is altered in the latter clause: instead of <i>“the comfort of Christ aboundeth,”</i> we have <b>through Christ aboundeth also our comfort</b>.

V.: he is speaking generally, of the community of consolation <i>subsisting </i>mutually between himself and the Corinthians; and it was this thought which helped to console him.<h2><u><b>8.]</u></h2> </b>It is generally supposed that the tribulation here spoken of was the danger into which St. Paul was brought by the tumult at Ephesus, related in Acts xix. This opinion has been recently defended by Neander, Wieseler, and Dr. Davidson, but impugned by De Wette, on the grounds, (1) that <i>“in Asia”</i> can hardly refer to Ephesus, which St. Paul generally <i>names</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 82; xvi. 8; (2) that he was not in danger of his life in this tumult. The first ground is hardly tenable: there would be an appropriateness in the expression “in Asia” here, as he has in his mind an apologetic account of the reasons which hindered him from leaving those parts and coming to them. I own, however, that the strong expressions here used do not seem to me to find their justification in any thing which we know of that tumult or its consequences. I am unable to assign <i>any other event </i>as in the Apostle’s mind : but the expressions seem rather to regard a <i>deadly sickness,</i> than a persecution: sce below, verses 9, 10.<h3><u><b>so that we utterly despaired even of life]</u></h3> </b>Such an expression surely would not be used of a tumult, where lite would have been <i>the first thing</i> in danger, if Paul had been at all mixed up in it,—but to some wearing and tedious suffering, inducing despondency in minor matters, which <i>even reached </i>the hope of life itself.<h2><u><b>9.]</u></h2></b> carries on and intensifies the description of his hopeless state. <br><br><b>we had in ourselves the response (or, sentence) of death, </b>i.e. our answer within ourselves to the question, ‘Life or Death?’ was, ‘Death.’ <h3><u><b>that we should not .. .]</u></h3></b> The expression of purpose is very similar in ch. iv. 7. <h3><u><b>which raiseth the dead]</u></h3></b> Our thoughts were weaned from all hope of surviving in this life, and fixed on that better deliverance which God shall work when He raises us from the dead.—To see in this expression merely a figure (as De Wette), and understand ‘Who <i>raiseth the dead</i>’ as equivalent to ‘<i>Who delivers men from peril of their lives</i>?’ because such peril is below and elsewhere (ch. xi. 23) called “<i>death</i>,” is surely very forced. Understanding it literally as above, I cannot see how it can be spoken with reference to the Ephesian tumult. If it alludes to <i>any external danger</i>, 1 should be disposed to refer it to the same obscure part of St. Paul’s history to which he alludes 1 Cor. xv. 32, where he also speaks of the<i> hope of the resurrection </i>as his great support. But there would he this objection, that these two passages can hardly refer to the <i>same </i>event; <i>this </i>evidently had taken place <i>since </i>the sending of the first Epistle.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E1IwdrrSk5Vg3I94yKLr4SBcAqmUne-F/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

See on that question, Introd. to 1 Cor. § v. <h2><u><b>16.]</u></h2></b><i><b> </b>If this is the same journey </i>which is announced in 1 Cor. xvi. 5, the idea of visiting them <i>in the way to</i> Macedonia as well as after having passed through it, must have occurred to him subsequently to the sending of that Epistle; or may even then have been a <i>wish</i>, but not expressed, from uncertainty as to its possibility,—the main and longer visit being there principally dwelt on. But perhaps the following is the more likely account of the matter. He had announced to them in the lost Epistle (see 1 Cor. v. 9) his intention, as here, of visiting them <i>on his way </i>to Macedonia: but the intelligence from “them of the household of Chloe” had altered his intention, so that, in 1 Cor. xvi., he speaks of visiting them <i>after he should have passed through</i> Macedonia. For this he was accused of levity of purpose. Certainly, some intention of coming to them seems to have been mentioned in that lost Epistle; see 1 Cor. iv. 18. But the “<i>being brought on his way to Judea</i>” can hardly but be coincident with the almsbearing scheme of 1 Cor. xvi. 4: in which case the two plans certainly are modifications of one and the same. <h2><u><b>17.]</u></h2> </b>Literally, <b>Did I at all use levity (of purpose)?

But this explanation is directly against the next verse, where yea and nay is clearly parallel to yea yea, and nay nay, here, the words being repeated, as in Matt. v. 37, without altering the sense : and inconsistent with ver. 23 and ch. ii. 1, where he says that his alteration of plan arose <i>from a desire to spare them.</i> <h2><u><b>18.]</u></h2></b> Such fickleness, you know, was not my habit in preaching to you. <h3><u><b>God is faithful,</b> <b>that]</u></h3> </b>i. e. as A.

Paul had sent Titus to Corinth, ch. xii. 18, partly to finish the collection for the saints, but principally to bring intelligence respecting the effect of the first Epistle. Probably it had been fixed that they should meet at Troas.<br><br><b> Titus my brother </b>implies a relation closer than merely that of Christian brotherhood —my <i>colleague </i>in the Apostleship.<h3><u><b>them]</u></h3> </b>the disciples there, understood from the context.<h2><u><b>14—17.]</u></h2> </b><i>Omitting, as presupposed, the fact of his having met with Titus in Macedonia, and the nature of the intelligence which he brought, he grounds on these a thanksgiving for that intelligence, and a magnification of his apostolic office.</i> It is evidently beside the purpose to refer this thanksgiving to the diffusion of the gospel in Macedonia, or in Troas, or to general considerations:—both the context, and the language itself (see below), shew that its reference is to the effects of the apostolic reproof on the Corinthians. <h2><u><b>14. leadeth us in triumph]</u></h2> </b><i>Two kinds of persons </i>were led in triumph: the <i>participators of the victory, </i>and the <i>victims of the defeat.</i> In Col. ii. 15, where only the same word is used in the original, the <i>latter </i>are plainly meant; here, according to many Commentators, the <i>former</i>: which however is never elsewhere the reference of the word, but it always implies<i> triumphing over.</i> The proud Cleopatra refused the terms offered her by Augustus, using this word, and saying, “<i>I will not be triumphed over</i>.” Meyer in consequence understands it in this sense here:<b> who ever triumphs over us,</b> i.e. “ who ceases not to exhibit us, His former foes, as overcome by Him:’— and adds, “God <i>began </i>His triumph over them at their conversion:—over Paul at Damascus, where he made him a servant, from being an enemy. This triumph he ever continues, not ceasing to exhibit before the world these his former foes, by the results of their present service, as overcome by Him. This, in the case before us, was ffected by Paul, in that (as Titus brought him word to Macedonia) his Epistle had produced such good results in Corinth.” De Wette objects to this as a strange way of expressing thankfulness for deliverance from our anxiety. But<i> is it</i> so to those who look beneath the surface? In our spiritual course,<i> our only true triumphs </i>are <i>God’s </i>triumphs over us. His defeats of <i>us</i>, are <i>our only </i>real victories. I own that this yet appears to me to be the <i>only admissible rendering. </i>We must not violate the known usage of a word, and invent another for which there is no precedent, merely for the sake of imagined perspicuity.

It is commonly assumed, that, Moses <i>spoke </i>to the Israelites, <i>having the vail on his face; </i>and this is implied in our version—‘till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face.” But the Hebrew and Septuagint gave a different account: “and <i>when he ceased speaking to them</i>, he put a vail over his face.” He spoke to them <i>without</i> the vail, with his face shining and glorified:—<i>when he had done speaking,</i> he placed the vail on his face: and that, not because they were afraid to look on him, but as here, <i>that they might not look on the end,</i> or the fading,<i> of that transitory glory</i>; that they might only see it as long as it was the credential of his ministry, and then it might be withdrawn from their eyes. Thus the declaration of God’s will to then was not in openness of speech, but was interrupted and broken by intervals of concealment, which ours is not. The opposition is twofold: (1) between the <i>vailed</i> and the <i>unvailed </i>ministry, as regards the mere fact of concealment in the one case, and openness in the other: (2) between the ministry which was suspended by the vailing, that its end might not be seen, and that which proceeds from glory to glory, <i>having no termination. </i>On the common interpretation, Commentators have found an almost insuperable difficulty in the purpose here stated, “<i>that the children of Israel might not</i>,” &c. The usual escape from it has been to render it (see A.V.), <i>‘so that the Israelites could not, </i>as in vér. 7. But this is an ungrammatical rendering of the Greek. I may remark also, that the narrative in Exodus, the Septuagint version of which the Apostle here closely follows (see below on ver. 16), implies that the brightness of Moses’ face had <i>place not on that one occasion only, but throughout his whole ministry</i> between the and the people. <i>When he ceased speaking to them, he put on the vail:</i> but <i>whensoever he went in before the Lord </i>to speak to Him, the <i>vail</i> <i>was removed</i> till he came out, and <i>had spoken to the Israelites all that the Lord had commanded him,</i> during which speaking they saw that his face shone,—and after which speaking he<i> again put on the vail. </i>So that the vail was the symbol of concealment and transitoriness : the part revealed they might see: beyond that, they could not: the ministry was a broken, interrupted one; its end was wrapped in obscurity.—In the words, <i>“the end of that which was being done away,”</i> we must not think, as some Commentators have done, of <i>Christ </i>(Rom. x. 4), any further than it may be hinted in the background that when the law came to an end, He appeared.<h2><u><b>14—18.]</u></h2> </b><i>The contrast is now made between the CHILDREN OF IsRAEL, on whose heart this vail still is in the reading of the O.T., and US ALL</i> (Christians),<i> who with uncovered face behold the glory of the Lord. </i>This section is parenthetical. Before and after it, the <i>ministry </i>is the subject: in it, <i>they to whom the ministry is directed.</i> But it serves to shew the <i>whole spirit </i>and <i>condition </i>of the two classes, and thus further to substantiate. the character of openness and. dom asserted of the Christian <b>14.

But as when we <i>listen</i>, the speaker is the <i>agent</i>, and the hearers are <i>passive</i>,—so on the other hand, when we <i>read</i>, <i>we </i>are the <i>agents</i>, and the book is <i>passive</i>. The book is the same to all: the difference between those who understand and those who do not understand is now a <i>subjective </i>difference—the vail is no longer on the face of the speaker, but on the <i>heart of the reader.</i> So that of necessity the form of the similitude is changed. <br><br><b>For </b>(answering to an understood clause, ‘and remain hardened’) <b>to the present day the same vail </b>(which was once on the face of Moses) <b>remains at the reading of the Old Covenant </b>(i.e. <b>‘Testament</b>: as we now popularly use the words, <i>the book comprising the ancient Covenant</i>), <b>the discovery not being made </b>(by the removal of the vail: literally, it <b>not being unvailed</b>),<b> that it</b> (the Old Test.) <b>is done away</b> (or, being done away: but the other is better here) <b>in Christ</b> (that the Old Covenant has passed away, being superseded by Christ). This I believe to be the only admissible sense of the words, <i>consistently with the symbolism of the passage.</i> The renderings, <i>‘remains not taken away—for it</i> (i.e the vail) <i>is done away in Christ,’ </i>and<i> </i>(as A.V.) ‘<i>remaineth ....untaken away . . . which vail is done away in Christ,</i>’—are inadmissible: (1) because they make the verb <b>is done away,</b> which thronghout the passage belongs to the <i>glory of the ministry,</i> to apply to the <i>vail</i>: and (2) because ‘they give no satisfactory sense. It is not <i>because </i>the vail can only be done away in Christ, that it now remains untaken away on their hearts, but<i> because their hearts are hardened. </i>The word in the original, <b>unvailed</b>, has been probably chosen, as is often the practice of the Apostle, on account of its relation to <i>vail</i>,—<b>it not being unvailed to them that</b>... <h2><u><b>15.]</u></h2> But </b>(reassertion of the fact that it is not unvailed, with a view to the next clause) <b>to this day, whenever Moses is read, a vail lieth upon their heart</b> (understanding).<h2><u><b>16.]</u></h2> </b>Here, the object of comparison is, <i>the having on a vail, and taking it off on going into the presence of the Lord. </i>This<i> Moses did</i>: and the choice of the <i>same words</i> as those of the Septuagint, shews the closeness of the comparison: “<i>But whensoever Moses went in before the Lord to speak to Him, the vail was taken away.</i>” This shall likewise be done in the case of the Israelites: <b>when it </b>(i.e. <i>their heart</i>,—not <i>Israel</i>, as some think,—nor <i>Moses</i>, as others) <b>turneth to the Lord</b> (here again the word is carefully chosen, being the very expression of the Septuagint, when the Israelites, having been afraid of the glory of the face of Moses, returned to him after being summoned by him:—“<i>they were afraid to</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qi_Zl-jI-fCUz1kwTZtz3sE31cp-BsQJ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Let me restate this,—as it is all-important towards the understanding of verses 17, 18. ‘When their heart<i> goes in to speak with God,</i>—ceases to contemplate the dead letter, and begins to commune with the Spirit of the old covenant (the Spirit of GOd), then the veil is removed, as it was from the face of Moses.’<h2><u><b>17.]</u></h2> Now the Lord is the Spirit: </b>i.e. the <b>Lord </b>of ver. 16 is the <i>Spirit</i>, whose word the O.T. is: the <i>spirit</i>,—as opposed to the <i>letter</i>;—which <i>giveth life,</i> ver. 6: meaning, ‘<i>thé Lord</i>,’ as here spoken of, “Christ,” ‘<i>is the Spirit</i>,’ is identical with the Holy Spirit: not personally nor essentially, but, as is shewn by the words “<i>the Spirit of the Lord</i>” following, <i>in this department of His divine working</i>:— <i>Christ</i>, here, <i>is the Spirit of Christ.</i> <b>and where the Spirit of the Lord</b> (see above) <b>is, is liberty.</b> They are fettered in spirit as Jong as they are slaves to the letter, as long as they have the vail on their hearts; but when they turn to the Lord the Spirit, which is not <i>a Spirit of bondage, but of adoption</i>, Rom. viii. 15, —and by virtue of whom “<i>thou art no longer a slave, but a son</i>,” Gal. iv. 7, —then they are at liberty.<h2><u><b>18.]</u></h2> But</b> (the sight of the Jews is thus intercepted; in contrast to whom)<b> WE all </b>(‘<i>all Christians</i>: not ‘we Apostles and teachers:’ the contrast is to the children of Israel above), <b>with unvailed face</b> (the vail having been removed at our conversion: the stress is on these words) <b>beholding in a mirror the glory of the Lord</b> (i.e. Christ: from ver. 16, 17.

The other renderings are out of the question, viz.: (1) “<i>the Lord of the Spirit,</i>” i.e. Christ, whose Spirit He is; which seems fo me to convey very little meaning, besides being an expression wholly unprecedented: (2) that of A.V. and of the Vulgate, and others, ‘<i>the Spirit of the Lord,</i>’ and (3) that of Chrysostom and others, ‘<i>the Spirit who is the Lord.’</i><h2><u><b>IV. 1—6.]</u></h2> </b><i>Taking up again the subject of his freedom of speech </i>(ch. iii. 12), <i>he declares his renunciation of all deceit, and manifestation of the truth to every man</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VFAZjgDwI5A8s1yakEFdAWLihEhQeaT/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Meyer, as unfortunately, limits the meaning to <i>natural life,</i> whereas (as above) the context plainly evinces <i>spiritual life </i>to be meant, not merely natural.—In Rom. viii. 10, 11, the vivifying influence of His Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead is spoken of as extending to the body also; <i>here</i>, the upholding influence of Him who delivers and preserves the body, is spoken of as vivifying the whole man: LIFE, in both places, <i>being the higher and spiritual life</i>, <i>including </i>the lower and natural. ‘And, in our relative positions,—of this <i>life</i>, YE are the examples,—a church of believers, alive to God through Christ in your various vocations, and not called on to be exhibited in an arena (1 Cor. iv. 9: Heb. x. 33), as WE are, who are (not indeed excluded from that <i>life</i>,—nay, it flows from us to you,— but are) more especially examples of conformity to the <i>death </i>of our common Lord: —in whom DEATH WORKETH.’<h2><u><b>13—18.]</u></h2> </b>ENCOURAGEMENTS: and first, FAITH, which enables us to go on preaching to you.

The idea that the Apostle could not thus speak of the resurrection, because he expected (1 Cor. xv. 51, 52; i. 8; ch. i. 13, 14) to be <i>alive </i>at the day of Christ, is best refuted by this very passage, ch. v. 1 ff., where <i>his admission of at least the possibility of his death </i>is<i> </i>distinctly set forth. The fact is that the anticipation of being raised here, having respect rather to the contrast of the future glory with the present suffer- ing, does not necessarily imply one or other side of the alternative of being quick or dead at the Lord’s coming, but em- braces all, quick and dead, in one blessed resurrection-state. —This confidence, of being presented at that day “<i>together with you”</i> is only analogous to his expressions elsewhere; see ch. i. 14; 1 Thess, ii. 19, 20;<h2><u><b>15.]</u></h2></b> Explanation of <b>together with you </b>as a ground of his trust: with reference also to what was said of <i>life working in you</i>, ver. 12; viz. that all, both the sufferings and victory of the ministers, are <i>for the church</i>: see the parallel expression, ch. i. 6, 7. <br><br><b>For all things</b> (of which we have been speaking: or perhaps hyperbolically, ALL THINGS, the whole working and arrangements of God, as in 1 Cor. iii, 22) <b>are on your behalf, that Grace, having abounded by means of the greater number</b> (who have received it),<b> may multiply the thanks- giving</b> (which shall accrue) <b>to the glory of God. </b>Besides this rendering (1), <i>three others </i>are possible: (2) ‘<i>that Grace,</i> <i>having abounded, may, on account of the thanksgiving of the greater number, be multiplied to the glory of God:</i> (3) <i>‘that Grace, having abounded, may, by means of the greater number, multiply the thanks- giving to the glory of God:</i> (4) <i>‘that Grace, having multiplied by means of the greater number the thanksgiving, may abound to the glory of God.’ </i>See these discussed, and my reason for preferring (1), in my Greek Test. As to the <i>sense</i> see the very similar sentiment, ch. i. 11), <i>thanksgiving </i>is the highest and noblest offering of the Church to God’s glory (compare Ps. 1. 23): <i>that this may be rendered</i>, in the best sense, as the result of the working of grace which has become abundant by means of the many recipients, is the great end of the Christian ministry.<h2><u><b>16—18.]</u></h2> </b><i>Second ground of encou- ragement—HOPE</i>. <b>16.] Wherefore</b> (on account of the hope implied in the faith spoken of ver. 14, which he is about to expand) <b>we shrink not back</b> (as in ver. 1: but <i>now</i>, owing to <i>despair</i>); <b>but </b>(on the contrary)<b> though even our outward man is being wasted away</b> (i. e. our <i>body</i>, see Rom. vii. 22, <i>is</i>, by this continued “<i>killing</i>” and “<i>working of death</i>,” <i>being worn out:</i> —he is not as yet speaking of dissolution by death, but only of gradual approxima- tion to it), <b>yet our inner (man) is being renewed day by day</b>: i.e. ‘our spiritual life, the life which testifies the life of Jesus, even in our mortal bodies (ver. 11), is con- tinually fed with fresh accessions of grace: see next verse.

But none need be raised. The <i>dwelling </i>which in this verse is said, <i>at the time of dissolution,</i> to be <b>in </b><i>the heavens</i>, is, <i>when we put it on,</i> in the next verse, our <i>own dwelling-place,</i> which<i> is</i> <b>from</b><i><b> </b>heaven. </i>Thus the intermediate state, though lightly passed over, as not belonging to the subject, is evidently in the mind of St. Paul.—Some Commentators understand<i> these words themselves (“a dwelling not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens”) </i>of the<i> intermediate state of absence from the body</i>: others, of an <i>immediate glorified body in heaven</i>, to be united with the body of the resurrection. Calvin hesitates: “It is uncertain whether he intends the state of blessed immortality which awaits the faithful after death, or the incorruptible and glorious body which shall be after the resurrection. In either of these senses there is nothing objectionable: but I prefer taking it, that the beginning of this building shall be the blessed state of the soul after death, and its consummation the glory of the final resurrection.” But if this be so, (1) the parallel will not hold, between the <i>dwelling </i>in one case, and the dwelling in the other,—and (2) the language of ver. 2 is against it, see below.<h2><u><b>2.]</u></h2> For also </b>(our knowledge, that we possess such a building of God, even in the case of our body being dissolved, is testified by the <i>earnest desire</i> which we have, to put on that new body <i>without</i> <i>such dissolution taking place.</i> See the similar argument in Rom. viii. 18, 19) <b>in this</b> (tabernacle)<b> we groan</b> (see Rom. viii. 23), <b>longing </b>(i.e. because we desire, the reason of our groaning)<b> to put on over this</b> (viz. <i>by being alive at the day of Christ</i>, and <i>not </i>dissolved as in ver. 1:—see on ver. 4 below.—The similitude is slightly changed : the <i>house </i>is now to be <i>put on,</i> as an outer garment, <i>over the fleshly body</i>) <b>our dwelling-place </b>(the word is slightly different from that rendered <i>dwelling </i>in ver. 1: that one being more general, this more appropriated to an inhabitant) <b>from heaven</b> (treated now as if<i> brought with </i>the Lord at His coming, and put upon us who are alive, and remain then.—“Therefore,” says Bengel, “this dwelling-place<i> is not heaven itself</i>”): <h2><u><b>3.]</u></h2> seeing that we shall verily be found</b> (shall prove to be) <b>clothed </b>(‘<i>having put on clothing,</i>’ viz. <i>a body</i>), <b>not naked </b>(<i>without a body:</i> see this rendering justified in my Greek Test., where I have also discussed the other translations.

So also the verb ‘<i>to labour</i>,’ Rom. xvi. 6, 12 (twice), Chrysostom and others interpret it of his manual work, 1 Cor. iv. 12; but sce ch. xi. 23, where this can hardly be; it is most probable that the <i>weariness of his excessive apostolic labour</i> was in his mind.<h3><u><b>watchings]</u></h3> </b>Chrysostom says, “During the nights in which he taught, or perhaps even wrought with his hands also.” But I would rather believe the <i>watchings </i>to have been<i> watchings through anxiety</i> for the churches. <h3><u><b>in fastings]</u></h3> </b>This is generally taken to refer to involuntary hunger and thirst.

But is it so with the two clauses preceding that one?

I believe the precise sense will only be found by taking into account the “<i>be ye enlarged also,</i>” below, and the occurrence of the expression in Ps. cxix. 32, “<i>I will run the way of Thy commandments, when Thou shalt enlarge my heart</i>.” Some light is also thrown upon it by the words “<i>receive (make room for)</i> <i>us</i>,’ ch. vii. 2.

The Apostle has had his heart <i>enlarged </i>towards the Corinthians: <i>he could and did take them in</i>, with their infirmities, their interests, their Christian graces, their defects and sins: but <i>they did not and could not take him in</i>: he was misunderstood by them, and his relation to them disregarded. This he here asserts, and deprecates. He assures them of <i>their </i>place in <i>his </i>heart, which is <i>wide enough for</i>, and <i>does contain them</i>; and refers back to this verse in ch, vii. 3, thus: “<i>I have said before, that ye are in our hearts</i>” ... He tells them, ver. <b>12.]</b> that they are not straitened in <i>him</i>, i.e. that any constraint which they may feel towards him, any want of confidence in him and persuasion of his real appreciation of their state and interests, arose not from <i>his </i>being <i>really </i>unable to appreciate <i>them</i>, and love them, and advise them,—but from <i>their</i> <i>own </i>confined view of <i>him</i>, of his love, his knowledge of and feeling for them. <b>13.] as a recompence in the same kind</b>, i.e. in the same manner, as a return for my largeness of heart to you. <br><br><b>as unto my children </b>(explains the use of the word <b>recompence</b>—it being naturally expected of children, that they should <i>requite </i>the love and care of their parents, by corresponding love and regard).<h2><u><b>14—VII. 1.]</u></h2> </b><i>Separate yourselves from unbelief and impurity.</i> On the nature of the connexion, Stanley has some good remarks. He now applies to circumstances which had arisen among the Corinthians the exhortation which in ver. 1 he deseribed himself as giving in pursuance of his ministry of reconciliation. The following exhortations are <i>general</i>, and hardly to be pressed as applying only to <i>partaking of meats offered to idols,</i> or to <i>marriage with unbelievers,</i>—but regard all possible connexion and participation, —all leanings towards a return to heathenism which might be bred by too great familiarity with heathens. <br><br><b>Be not </b>(literally, <b>become not,</b> perhaps, as expressing, ‘do not enter into those relations in which you must become’) <b>incongruous yokefellows </b>(the word in the original, and the idea, come from Lev. xix. 19) <b>with unbelievers. </b><h3><u><b>what fellowship]</u></h3></b> i.e. ‘<i>what share in the same thing</i>, <b>what community.</b> <b>righteousness </b>is the state of the Christian, being justified by faith: he is therefore excluded from <b>iniquity </b>(literally, <i>lawlessness</i>), the <i>proper fruit of faith </i>being <i>obedience</i>.<br><br><b>light</b>, of which we are the children, 1 Thess. v. 5, and not of darkness.<h2><u><b>15.

But no allusion has <i>as yet</i> been made to the former Epistle; and therefore it is much better to understand the words generally of the time when he resided among them, “In how many ways of which history says nothing, may such ruining of others be laid to the charge of Paul?

But there. is no difficulty, even on the strictest view of inspiration, in conceiving that the Apostle may have afterwards regretted the severity which he was guided to use; we know that Jonah, being directed by inspiration to pronounce the doom ef Nineveh, endeavoured to escape the unwelcome duty: and doubtless St. Paul, as a man, in the weakness of his affection for the Corinthians, was tempted to wish that he had never written that which had given them pain. But the result shewed that God’s Spirit had ordered it well, that he should thus write; and this his repentance was <i>repented of again. </i><h2><u><b>9.]</u></h2></b> Now, emphatic as distinguishing his present joy from his repentance: <i>now </i>that I know not only of your grief, but of its being grief which worked repentance. <h3><u><b>after a godly manner]</u></h3></b> literally, ‘<i>with reference to God,</i>’ i.e. with a mind regarding God’s estimate of your conduct. <br><br><b>in order that ye might in nothing be damaged by us</b>: not ‘<i>so that ye did not . . .</i>,’ as many Commentators : —the<i> divine purpose </i>of their grief is indicated; ‘God so brought it about, in order that your grief occasioned by me might have, not an injurious, but a beneficial effect.’ <h2><u><b>10.]</u></h2> </b><i>How </i>‘grief according to God’ <i>produces such an effect.</i><b> For </b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/137JU_nT32gLI42DpHAdj9poFhebTtZIb/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This and the other are called in ver. 23 “<i>our brethren</i>,” and were unquestionably <i>Christian brethren</i> in the usual sense.<i> Who this was</i>, we know not. Chrysostom and others suppose <i>Barnabas </i>to be meant: but there is no historical ground for this, and we can hardly suppose him put under Titus. Others suppose <i>Silas</i>: to whom this last objection would also apply: besides that he was well known to the Corinthians, and therefore would not need this recommendation. Origen, Jerome, and others, <i>Luke</i>:—and of these, all before Grotius (who pointed out the mistake; which however I see lately reproduced in Mr. Birks’s Horæ Apostolicæ, p. 242 f.) suppose the words,<i> “whose praise in the Gospel,”</i> to refer to his <i>gospel</i>, which he wrote;—but this is altogether without proof, as is the assumption by others that it was <i>Mark</i>. It may have been <i>Trophimus</i>, who (Acts xx. 4) accompanied Paul into Asia, and (xxi. 29) to Jerusalem: so De Wette and Wieseler. If the expression <b>whose praise in </b>(the matter of) <b>the Gospel is throughout all the Churches</b>, is to be compared with any similar eulogium, that of Gaius in Rom. xvi. 23, seems to correspond most nearly: “<i>Gaius, mine host and [the host] of the whole church:</i>” but he was <i>resident at Corinth</i>, see 1 Cor. i. 14. A Gaius, a Macedonian, is mentioned Acts xix. 29, as one of the fellow-travellers of Paul, as here, together with Aristarchus, which latter we know accompanied him to Jerusalem (but see below on ch. ix. 4).—It must then rest in uncertainty. <h2><u><b>19.]</u></h2> </b>Parenthetical (see on ver. 20) adding to his general commendation a particular qualification for<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15WQuLaDTd2Gx73kpzgboE0sq7XkX-CAM/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

(1) Many of the ancient Commentators assume that they<i> taught gratis</i>, and were proud of it,—and that St. Paul would also teach gratis, to put both on an equality and take this occasion of boasting from them. This would suit the sense of the <i>present verse, </i>but seems (see above) at variance with the fact. (2) Theodoret and others suppose them to have <i>pretended </i>to the credit of self-denial, while really making gain, and that St. Paul means, that he will <i>reduce them from pretended to real</i> self-denial. But this too is inconsistent with the context. St. Paul’s boast of disinterested teaching was peculiarly <i>his own, </i>and there is nothing to shew that the false teachers ever professed or made any boast, of the like. His resolution did not spring out of an actual comparison instituted by them between their own practice and what they might falsely allege to be his, but was adopted even before his coming to Corinth, arguing<i> à priori </i>that it was best to cut off any possible occasion of such depreciation of him from his probable adversaries. (3) I cannot adopt any one of the above accounts of the sentence, for the negative reasons already given, and because all of them seem to me to have missed the clue to the meaning which the chapter itself furnishes. This clue I find in vv. 18 ff. See the other interpretations discussed in any Greek Test. I have endeavoured there to shew that the meaning is, ‘<i>that in the matter(s) of which they boast they may be found even as we:</i>’ i.e. we may be on a fair and equal footing:’ ‘that there may be no adventitious comparisons made between us arising out of misrepresentations of my course of procedure among you, but that in every matter of boasting, we may be fairly compared and judged by facts.’ And then, before the <b>for </b>of ver. 13 will naturally be supplied, ‘And this will end in their discomfiture: <i>for</i> realities they have none, no weapons but misrepresentation, being <i>false apostles</i>,’ &c. <h2><u><b>13.]</u></h2></b> <b>For </b>(see above: the <b>for </b>implying also that the choice of the above line of conduct has been made in a conviction of their falsehood and its efficacy to detect it) <b>such men are false apostles, dishonest workmen </b>(in that they pretend to be teachers of the Gospel, and are in the mean time subserving their own ends), <b>changing themselves into</b> (in appearance) <b>apostles of Christ. </b>By a <i>fair </i>comparison between us, this mask will be stript off;—by the abundance of my sufferings, and distinctions vouchsafed by the Lord, my Apostolicity will be fully proved, and their Pseud-apostolism shewn.<b> </b><h2><u><b>14, 15. for even Satan .. .]</u></h2> </b>If any definite allusion is here intended, it is perhaps to Job i. 6, &c.: but I would rather suppose the <i>practice </i>of Satan in tempting and seducing men to be intended.<h2><u><b>14. an angel of light]</u></h2></b> God is light, and inhabits light, and His angelic attendants are surrounded with brightness, see Acts xii. 7; Ps. civ. 4; whereas Satan is the Power of <i>darkness</i>, see Luke xxii. 53.<h2><u><b>15.]</u></h2></b> He, as the father of falsehood and wrong (John viii, 44), is directly opposed to “<i>the righteousness of God</i>,” Matt. vi. 33, that manifestation of God by which He is known to us in the Gospel, Rom. i. 17.<br><br><b>of whom</b> (notwithstanding this disguise) <b>the end shall be correspondent to their works</b> (not to their pretensions).<h2><u><b>16—21.]</u></h2> </b><i>Excuses for his intended</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10AvNtSx0apAw9TLnHUkMYb6L0Aj3t4gk/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Our country, <i>place of citizenship</i>, is <i>in heaven</i>, Phil. iii. 20: there our High Priest stands, blessing us.

In Him, in one wide sense, were all mankind elected, inasmuch as He took their flesh and blood, and redeemed them, and represents them before the Father: but in the proper and final sense, this can be said only of His faithful ones, His Church, who are incorporated in Him by the Spirit. But in any sense, all God’s election is <i>in </i>HIM only) <b>before the foundation of the world</b> (this expression occurs only here in St. Paul.

It is a noteworthy observation of Harless here, that the choice of the word, the BLOOD of Christ, is of itself a testimony to the idea of <i>expiation </i>having been in the, writer’s mind. Not the <i>death </i>of the victim, but its BLOOD, was the typical instrument of expiation.

Thus <i>the dispensation of the fulness of the times</i> will mean, the filling up, completing, fulfilment, of the appointed seasons, carrying on during the Gospel dispensation. Now, belonging to, carried on during, this fulfilling of the periods or seasons, is the <i>œconomy </i>or <i>dispensation </i>here spoken of. And having regard to the derivation and usage of the word, it will mean, <i>the giving</i> <i>forth of the Gospel under God's providential arrangements.</i> First and greatest of all, HE is the <i>Steward or œconomus, of the dispensation:</i> then, above all others, His divine Son: and as proceeding from the Father and the Son, the Holy Spirit— and then in subordinate degrees every one who <i>is entrusted with carrying out the œconomy,</i> i.e. all Christians, even to the lowest, as <i>stewards of the manifold grace of God,</i> 1 Pet. iv. 10.

Then in the second pair <b>power </b>is mere <i>might</i>, the raw material, so to speak, of <i>authority: lordship </i>is that pre-eminence which <i>power </i>establishes for itself.

The following shews that in this enumeration not only earthly, nor only heavenly authorities are meant to be included, but both together,—so as to make it perfectly general. That the <i>evil spirits</i> are included, is therefore manifest: see also ch. vi. 12; 1 Cor. xv. 24–26),<b> and every name that is named </b>(further generalization: indicating not merely titles of honour, nor persons, but a transition from the <i>authorities, &c. </i>to <i>all things</i> below: answering to “<i>nor any other creature,</i>” in Rom. viii. 39.

And forasmuch as that heavenly state which is for us <i>future</i>, is now, to those in it, present, <i>it </i>is by the easiest transition denoted by “<i>the age to come :</i>” compare Luke xx. 35, and especially Heb. ii. 5, “<i>the world to come.</i>” So that the meanings seem combined,—‘every name now named in earth and heaven:’ and, ‘every name which we name,—not only now, but hereafter.’ Wesley says, beautifully expanding Bengel : “We know that the king is above all, though we cannot name all the officers of his court. So we know that Christ is above all, though we are not able to name all His subjects”): <h2><u><b>22.</b>]</u></h2> <b>and subjected all things under His feet</b> (from the Messianic Ps, viii.; not without an allusion also above to Ps. cx. 1),<b> and gave</b> (<i>‘presented</i>;’ keep the literal sense: not ‘ <i>appointed </i>;’ see below) HIM (emphatic, from its position: HIM, thus exalted, thus glorified, the Father not only raised to this supereminence, but gave Him to His redeemed as their Head, &c.) <b>as head over all things to the Church </b>(the meaning is thus to be gained, from what follows: CHRIST is Head over all things: the Church is the BODY of Christ, and as such is the fulness of Him who fills all with all: the Head of such a Body, is Head over all things; therefore when God gives Christ as <i>Head </i>to the church, He gives Him as <i>Head over</i> <i>all</i> <i>things </i>to the church, from the necessity of the case. Thus what follows is explanatory of this), <b>which same</b> (Church) <b>is His BODY</b> (not in a figure merely: it is veritably His Body: not that which in our glorified humanity He personally bears, but that in which He, as the Christ of God, is manifested and glorified by spiritual organization.

But I am disposed to seek my interpretation of the words from a much more obvious source: viz. the persuasion and common parlance of mankind, founded on analogy with well known facts. We are tempted by evil spirits, who have access to us, and suggest thoughts and desires to our minds. We are surrounded by the air, which is the vehicle of speech and of all suggestions to our senses. Tried continually as we are by these temptations, what so natural, as to assign to their ministers a dwelling in, and power over that element which is the vehicle of them to us? And thus our Lord, in the parable of the sower, when He would represent the devil coming and taking away the seed out of the heart, figures him by <i>the birds of the air</i> (or,<i> of heaven</i>). The Apostle then, in using this expression, would be appealing to the common feeling of his readers, not to any recondite or questionable system of dæmonology. That traces are found in such systems, of a belief agreeing with this, is merely a proof that they have embodied the same general feeling, and may be used in illustration, not as the ground, of the Apostle’s saying),<b> of the spirit</b> (<i>the power</i> being used as designating [see above] the personal aggregate of those evil ones who have this power,<b> the spirit</b>, in apposition with it, represents their aggregate character, as an influence on the human mind, a spirit of ungodliness and disobedience,— the “<i>spirit of the world</i>” of 1 Cor. ii. 12, —the aggregate of the “<i>seducing spirits</i>” of 1 Tim. iv. 1) <b>which is now</b> (i.e. ‘still:’ contrast to “<i>once</i>,’—to <i>you</i>, who have escaped from his government above) <b>working in the sons of</b> (the expression is a Hebraism, but is strictly reproduced in the fact: that of which they are sons, is the source and spring of their lives, not merely an accidental quality belonging to them) <b>disobedience</b>: <h2><u><b>3.</b>]</u></h2> <b>among whom </b>(the “<i>sons of disobedience</i>:” not merely local, but ‘numbered among whom’) <b>we also all</b> (WHO?

It can hardly then be that here he should have departed from his universal usage, and placed an unmeaning “<i>all</i>” after “<i>we</i>,” merely to signify, ‘we Jews, every one of us.

The disputes about the meaning of this <i>vivifying</i>, or <i>quickening</i>, have arisen from not bearing in mind the relation in New Test. language between natural and spiritual death. We have often had occasion to observe that spiritual death in the New Test. includes in it and bears with it natural death as a consequence, to such an extent that this latter is often not thought of as worth mentioning : see especially John xi. 25, 26, which is the key-text for all passages regarding life in Christ. So here—God vivified us together with Christ : in the one act and fact of His Resurrection He raised all His people—to spiritual life, and in that to victory over death, both spiritual, and therefore necessarily physical also. To dispute therefore whether such an expression as this is past [spiritual], or future [physical], is to forget that the whole includes its parts. Our <i>spiritual life</i> is the primary subject of the Apostle’s thought: but this includes in itself our share in the Resurrection and exaltation [ver. 6] of Christ.

Therefore I conceivé we are compelled to interpret analogously: viz. to understand the “<i>ages to come</i>” of the coming ages of the church, and the per- sons involved in them to be the future members of the church. Thus the mean- ing will be nearly as in ch. i, 12.—The supposed reference to the future state of glory seems not to agree with <i>the language here</i>,—nor with the fact that the second coming and future kingdom of Christ are hardly ever alluded to in this Epistle)<b> the exceeding riches of His grace in</b> (of the material of which this display of His grace will consist, the department in which it will find its exercise) <b>kindness</b> (see especially Rom. ii. 4) towards us in see ‘<i>through</i>’ as A.

The primary allusion seems to be, to the rending of the veil at the crucifixion: not that that veil separated Jew and Gentile, but that it, the chief symbol of separation from God, included in its removal the admission to Him of that one body into which Christ made Jew and Gentile. This complex idea is before the Apostle throughout the sentence: and necessarily 5 ; for the reconciliation which Christ effected between Jew and Gentile was in fact only a subordinate step of the great reconciliation of both to God, which He effected by His sacrifice in the flesh,— and in speaking of one he speaks of the other also. The <b>partition</b>, from what has been said above, is more general in sense than the <b>middle wall</b>; is in fact the whole arrangement, of which that was but an instrument—the separation itself, consequent on a system of separation: it represents therefore the whole legal system, ceremonial and moral, which made the whole separation, —of Jew from Gentile,— and in the background, of both from God), [<b>to wit</b>] <b>the enmity </b>(not, of Jew and Gentile : so strong a term is not justified as applying to their separation, nor does such a reference satisfy ver. 16,—see there; —but, the enmity in which both were involved against God, see Rom, viii. 7. <b>the enmity</b> is in apposition with <b>the partition.</b> This enmity was the real cause of separation from God, and in being so, was the inclusive, mediate cause of the separation between Jew and Gentile. Christ, by abolishing the first, abolished the other also: see below), <b>in His flesh </b>(to be joined, not with <b>abolishing</b>,as the A. V., which is very harsh, breaking the parallelism,—but with <b>brake down</b>. Christ destroyed the <i>partition</i>, i.e. the enmity, in, or by, His flesh ; see on ver. 16, where the same idea is nearly repeated. It was in His crucified flesh, which was <i>“in the likeness of the Slesh of sin</i>,” that He slew this enmity) ; <b>having done away the law of decretory commandments</b> (this law was the <i>partition</i>, —the great exponent of the <i>enmity</i>. Its specific nature was that it consisted in commandments, decretorily or dogmatically expressed. This law, moral and ceremonial, its decalogue, its ordinances, its rites, was entirely done away in and by the death of Christ. See Col. ii. 13—15, notes. And the end of that <i>abolition </i>was);<b> that He might create the two</b> (Jew and Gentile) <b>in Himself into one new man</b> (observe, not that He might reconcile the two <i>to each other</i> only, nor is the Apostle speaking merely of any such reconciliation: but that he might incorporate the two, reconciled in Him to God, into one <i>new </i>man,—the old man to which both belonged, the enemy of God, having been slain in His flesh on the Cross.

Was <i>this </i>the <i>enmity</i>, the slaying of which brought in the <i>reconciliation </i>as this verse implies? Does such a meaning of the word at all satisfy the solemnity of the sentence, or of the next two verses? I cannot think so: and must maintain the <i>enmity </i>here [and if here, then in ver. 15 also] to be that between man and God, which Christ did slay on the cross, and which being brought to an end, the separation between Jew and Gentile, which was the result of it, was done away) <b>thereby</b> (or, <b>in </b>or <b>on it</b>: viz. the cross: compare Col. ii. 15, notes: not <i>in His body</i>: see above): <b>and having come, He preached </b>(how ? when?

But we find a key to the expression in John xiv. 18: see also ver. 28. And this coming was,—by his Spirit poured out on the Church. There is an expression of St. Paul’s, singularly parallel with this, and of itself strongly corroborative of the genuineness of our Epistle; in Acts xxvi. 23: “<i>That Christ should suffer, and that He should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</i>” This coming therefore is by His Spirit [see on ver. 18], and minis- ters, and ordinances in the Church) <b>peace to you who were far off, and peace to those </b>(not ‘<i>to us</i>,’ for fear of still upholding the distinction where he wishes to merge it altogether) <b>that were nigh</b> (this <b>peace </b>is plainly then not mere mutual reconciliation, but that far greater peace which was effected by Christ’s death, peace with God, which necessitated the union of the far off and the near in one body in Him. This is shewn especially by the repetition of the word <b>peace</b>. See Isa. lvii. 19.—Then follows the empowering reason, why he should preach <i>peace </i>to us both: and it is this ver. 18 especially which cannot be satisfied on the ordinary hypothesis of mere reconciliation between Jew and Gentile being the subject in the former verses. Here clearly the union [not reconciliation, nor is enmity predicated of them] of Jew and Gentile is subordinated to the blessed fact of an access TO GOD having been provided for both through Christ by the Spirit), <h2><u><b>18</b>.]</u></h2> <b>For through Him we have our access </b>(representing, both here and in Rom. v. 2, and ch. iii. 12, <i>present </i>liberty of approach) <b>both of us in </b>(united in, 1 Cor. xii. 13) <b>one Spirit </b>(not ‘<i>one frame of mind</i>: the whole structure of the sentence, as compared with any similar one, such as 2 Cor. xiii. 18, will shew what spirit is meant, viz. the Holy Spirit of God, already alluded to in ver. 17: see above.

Is it a genitive of apposition, so that the Apostles and Prophets themselves <i>are </i>the foundation? This has been supposed by numerous Commentators, from Chrysostom to De Wette. But, not to mention the very many other objections which have been well and often urged against this view, this one is to my mind decisive, —that it entirely destroys the imagery of the passage. The temple, into which these Gentiles were built, is the mystical body of the Son, in which the Father dwells by the Spirit, ver. 22. The Apostles and Prophets [see below], yea, Jesus Christ Himself, as the great inclusive Head Corner Stone (see again below], are also built into this temple. [That He includes likewise the <i>foundation</i>, and IS the foundation, is true, and must be remembered, but is not prominent here.] Clearly then the Apostles and Prophets cannot <i>be</i> the foundation, being here spoken of as parts of the upper building, together with these Gentiles, and with Jesus Christ Himself. But again, does the genitive mean, the foundation which the Apostles and Prophets<i> have laid</i>? So also very many Commentators. As clearly,—not thus. To introduce them here as <i>agents</i>, is as inconsistent as the other. No agents are here spoken of, but merely the fact of the great building in its several parts being built up together. The only remaining interpretation then is, to regard the genitive as simply possessive: ‘<i>the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets,</i>’ — ‘<i>the Apostles’ and Prophets’ foundation</i>’ — that upon which they as well as your- selves are built. This explanation, which I find ascribed to Bucer only, seems to me beyond question the right one. See more below.—But (2) <i>who are the </i><b>prophets</b>? They have commonly been taken, without enquiry, as the <i>Old Test. prophets</i>. And certainly, the sense, with some little straining, would admit of this view. They may be said to be built upon Christ, as belonging to that widest acceptation of His mystical body, in which it includes all the saints, Old as well as New Test. But besides the objections arising from the form of the sentence, which the English reader cannot appreciate, there is this weighty one: the usage of the expression <b>apostles and prophets </b>in ch. ili. 5. There unquestionably the prophets are New Test. <b>prophets</b>; and again in ch. iv. 11, And it is difficult to conceive that the Apostle should have used the two words conjoined here, in a different sense. Even stronger is the consideration arising from the whole sense of the passage. All here is strictly Christian, — post-Judaic, — consequent on Christ’s death, and triumph, and His coming preaching peace by the Spirit to the united family of man. So that we must decide for these prophets being <i>New Test. prophets</i>: those who ranked next to the Apostles in the government of the church: see Acts xi. 27, note. They were not in every case distinct from the Apostles: the apostleship probably always including the gift of <i>prophecy</i>: so that all the Apostles themselves might likewise have been <i>prophets</i>), <b>Christ Jesus Himself </b>(the <b>Himself </b>exalts the dignity of the temple, in that not only it has among its stones Apostles and prophets, but the Lord Himself is built into it) <b>being the Head corner stone </b>(see, besides reff., Jer. li. 26; Acts iv. 11. The reference here is clearly to that Headstone of the Corner, which is not only the most conspicuous but the most important in the building: “which, being placed in the corner, joins and rules the two walls of the building.” Builders set up such a stone, or build such a pillar of brick, before getting up their walls, to rule and square them by. I must again repeat, that the fact of Jesus Christ being Himself the <i>foundation</i>, however it underlies the whole, is not to be brought in as interfering with this portion of the figure);<h2><u><b>21</b>.]</u></h2> <b>in whom </b>(Christ keeps the whole together : and not only so, but He is in reality the inclusive Head of the building: it all <i>consists</i>, is upheld, is squared and ruled by its unity to and in Him) <b>all the building being framed exactly together is growing </b>(there seems no reason why<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n_i57uZdhp4Ka_Mnpa3xUh33ICjwWol_/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Both participle and verb imply that the fitting together and the growing are still going on: and the only way which we in English have to mark this so as to avoid the chance of mistake, is by the auxiliary verb substantive, and the participle. The bare present, ‘groweth,’ is in danger of being mistaken for the abstract quality, and the temporal development is thus lost sight of: whereas the other, in giving prominence to that temporal development, also necessarily implies the ‘normal, perpetual, unconditioned nature of the organic increase’) <b>unto an holy temple in the Lord </b>(i.e. according to apostolic usage, and the sense of the whole passage, ‘<i>in Christ</i>.’ These “<i>in whom</i>,” —“<i>in the Lord</i>,” “<i>in whom</i>,” —like the frequent repetitions of the name <i>Christ </i>in vv.12, 13, are used by the Apostle to lay all stress on the fact that Christ is the inclusive Head of all the building, the element in which it has its being and its growth.

For this cause the Angels henceforth refuse worship from Apostles, as their superiors in the ministry, Rev. xix. 10, and with reason.” Grotius.

It is not easy to say, to what the reference is, or why the idea is here introduced. The Apostle seems, regarding God as the Father of us His adopted children in Christ, to go forth into the fact, that He, in this His relation to us, is in reality the great original and prototype of the paternal relation, wherever found. And this he does, by observing that every <b>patria</b>, <i>compaternity</i>, body of persons, having a common father, is thus named [in Greek], <i>from that father</i>, —and so every earthly [and heavenly] family reflects in its name [and constitution] the being and sourceship of the great Father Himself. But then, what are <i>families in heaven</i>? Some have treated the idea of paternity <i>there </i>as absurd: but is it not necessarily involved in <i>any </i>explanation of this passage? He Himself is the Father of spirits, Heb. xii, 9, the Father of lights, James i. 17:— may there not be fathers in the heavenly Israel; as in the earthly?

Those who do not understand this, have yet their first lesson in the Old Test. to learn. With this caution, let us approach the difficulties of the citation in detail), <b>When he ascended up on high </b>(viz. Christ, at His Ascension. The ascending, in the Psalm, is that of God, whose presence was symbolized by the ark, to Zion, The Apostle changes the words from the 2nd person to the 3rd; the <i>address </i>asserting a <i>fact</i>, which fact he cites), <b>he led captive a captivity </b>(i.e. ‘those who <i>suffer </i>captivity :’ a troop of captives : such is the constant usage of the abstract word <i>captivity </i>for the concrete in the Septuagint: and it is never put for ‘those who cause captivity,’ as some would interpret it. In the Psalm, these would be, the captives from the then war, whatever it was: in the interpretation, they were God’s enemies, Satan and his hosts), <b>he gave gifts unto mankind </b>(the original meaning of the Hebrew is obscure. The sense (see my Greek Test.) seems to be, ‘<i>Thou hast taken gifts among men,</i>’ hast, as a victor, surrounded by thy victorious host, brought gifts home, spoils of —and the result of such reception would be naturally stated as the distribution of them among such hosts, and the people,—as indeed ver. 12 of the Psalm has already stated. And so the Chaldee paraphrast understood the words, interpreting the passage <i>of Moses</i>: ‘thou hast given gifts to the sons of men’). <h2><u><b>9</b>.]</u></h2> Further explanation of this text. <b>But that He ascended, what is it </b>(does it imply) <b>except that He also </b>(as well)<b> descended into the lower parts of the earth </b>(the argument seems to be this: the Ascension here spoken of was not a first exaltation, but a <i>return </i>to heaven of one who dwelt in heaven: compare John iii, 13, which is in fact the key to these verses. The <i>ascent </i>implied a previous <i>descent</i>, This is the leading thought. But it is doubted <i>how far </i>the words the <b>lower parts of the earth </b>carry that descent, whether to earth merely, so that “<i>of the earth</i>” is the genitive of <i>apposition</i>, “<i>the lower parts</i>, which are <i>the earth</i>,”’—or to <i>Hades</i>, so that it is genitive of <i>possession</i>, <i>“the lower parts </i>which belong to the earth.” It cannot be said that the descent into hell would be irrelevant here,—or that our Lord ascended, not from Hades, but from the earth: for, the <i>fact of descent </i>being the primary thought, we have only to ask as above, <i>how far </i>that descent is carried in the Apostle’s mind. The greater the descent, the greater the ascent: and if the <i>captivity </i>consisted of Satan and his powers, the warfare in which they were taken captive would most naturally be contemplated in all its extent, as reaching to their habitation itself: — ‘ this ascent, what does it imply but a descent, and that even to the lower parts of the earth from which the spoils of victory were fetched?’ And this meaning seems to be upheld by the words, “<i>that he might fill </i><b>all things</b>,” which follow, as well as by the contrast furnished by up above <b>all the heavens</b>.—This interpretation is upheld by most of the ancients, and some ot the best of the moderns: that of the Incarnation merely, <i>descent on earth</i>, by most of the moderns: that of Christ’s <i>death </i>[and burial], by Chrysostom and some others) ?<h2><u><b>10</b>.]</u></h2> <b>He that descended, He </b>(and no other: “for it was not one that descended, and another that ascended,” Theodoret).<b> is also He that ascended </b>(in English idiom, we must express it as in the text; see again John iii. 18) <b>up above </b>(see on ch. i. 21) <b>all the heavens </b>(compare Heb. vii. 26, ‘<i>made higher than the heavens</i>:” and iv. 14, “<i>that has passed through the heavens</i>.” It is natural that one who, like St. Paul, had been brought up in the Jewish habits of thought, should still use their methods of speaking, according to which the heaven is expressed in the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_2r_xEgHhz-ar9t3p895TanxtuzI_M5r/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is almost impossible to express it satisfactorily in English.

For the same reason he omits the designation in the Epistle to the Philippians. <h3><u><b>unto the church</b>]</u></h3> So in 2 Thess., Gal., 1 and 2 Cor.: in the other Epistles, viz, Rom., Eph., Col., Phil., more generally, e.g.,—“<i>to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints</i>.” This is most probably accounted for by the circumstances of, the various Epistles. We may notice that the genitive plural of the <i>persons constituting the church</i> occurs only in the addresses of these two Epistles. We may render ‘of Thessalonians,’ or ‘of the Thessalonians:’ better the former. <br><br><b>in God the Father</b> marks them as not being heathens,—and <b>the Lord </b> <b>Jesus Christ</b> as not being Jews.—The <b>in</b>, as usual, denotes <i>communion</i> and <i>participation</i> <i>in</i>, as the element of spiritual life. “Grace and peace from God be unto you, that you who are deprived of human favour and secular peace, may have both these with God.” Anselm. The words which follow in the A. V., are not yet added in this, St. Paul’s first Epistle. Afterwards they become a common formula with him.<h2><u><b>2—III. 13.</b>]</u></h2> FIRST PORTION OF THE EPISTLE, <i>in which he pours out his heart to the Thessalonians respecting all the circumstances </i> <i>of their reception of and adhesion </i> <i>to the faith</i>. <h2><u><b>2—10.</b>]</u></h2> Jowett remarks, that few passages are more characteristic of the style of St. Paul than this one: both as being the overflowing of his love in thankfulness for his converts, about: whom he can never say too much: and as to the very form and structure of the sentences, which seem to grow under his hand, gaining force in each successive clause by the repetition and expansion of the preceding. <h2><u><b>2.</b>]</u></h2> <b>We give thanks</b>, coming so immediately after the mention of Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, can hardly be here<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xse36WvJ6Os8bAHoyQN0llDG8uO9nCCW/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For undoubted as it is that he often, e. g. ch. iii. 1, 2, where see note, uses the plural of himself alone, yet it is as undoubted that he uses it also of himself and of his fellow-labourers—e. g., 2Cor. i. 18, 19. <h3><u><b>always for you all</b>]</u></h3> We have the same alliteration Eph. v. 20. On the latter words in this verse, see Rom. i. 9 f. <br><br><b>unceasingly</b> seems, by the nearly parallel place, Rom. i. 9, to belong to <i>what goes before</i>, not to <i>what follows</i>.

Olshausen refers the words to all three ceding substantives—but this seems alien from St.Paul’s style. On all the three Jowett says well, “Your faith, hope, and love; a faith that had its outward effect on your lives : a love that spent itself in the service of others: a hope that was no mere transient feeling, but was content to wait for the things unseen when Christ should be revealed.” <br><br><b>before God</b> connects most naturally with ver. 2—<b>making mention .... before God</b>: not to the genitives preceding (see Rom. iv. 17; xiv. 22).<h2><u><b>4.]</u></h2> knowing</b> refers back to <i>remembering</i>, <b>in that we know</b>—or, <b>for we know</b>. It must not be paraphrased “<i>in that</i> <i>ye</i> <i>know</i>,” as some have done. The words <b>by</b> <b>God</b> belong to “<i>beloved</i>,” as in 2 Thess. ii. 13, see also Rom. i. 7: not, as A. V., to “<i>your election</i>,” which is an ungrammatical rendering. <br><br>The word <b>election</b> must not be softened down: it is the election unto life of individual believers by God, so commonly adduced by St. Paul (reff.: and 1 Cor. i. 27. <br><br><b>your election</b>, i.e. <b>the election of you</b>: knowing that God elected you. <h2><u><b>5. Because</b>]</u></h2> Verses 5, 6 ff. are meant not to explain <i>wherein</i> their election <i>consisted</i>, but to give reasons in matter of fact for concluding the existence of that election. These reasons are (1) the power and confidence with which he and Silvanus and Timothy preached among them (ver. 5), and (2) the earnest and joyful manner in which the Thessalonians received it (vv. 6 ff.). Both these were signs of God’s grace to them—tokens of their election vouchsafed by Him. <h3><u><b>our gospel</b>]</u></h3> i.e. the gospel which we preached. <h3><u><b>came unto you</b>]</u></h3> literally, <b>became to you</b>—proved to be, in its approach to you. The preposition <b>in</b>, thrice repeated, indicates the form and manner in which the <i>preaching</i> <i>was carried on</i>, not that in which the Thessalonians received it, which is not treated till ver. 6. <h3><u><b>in power</b>]</u></h3> not ‘<i>in miracles</i>,’ but <b>in power</b> of utterance and of energy. <h3><u><b>and in the Holy Ghost</b>]</u></h3> i.e. not only in force and energy, but <b>in</b> <b>the Holy Ghost</b>—in a manner which could only be ascribed to the operation of the Holy Spirit. <br><br><b>in much confidence</b> (of faith).

It is somewhat difficult here to fix exactly the point of comparison, in which they imitated their ministers and Christ. Certainly it is not merely, in <i>receiving the word</i>—for to omit other objections, this would not apply at all to Him :—and therefore, not in any qualifying detail of their <i>method</i> of reception of the word.—So far being clear, we have but one particular left, and that respects the circumstances under which, and the spirit with which: and here we find a point of comparison even with Christ Himself: viz. joyful endurance in spirit under sufferings. This it was in which they imitated the Apostles, and their divine Master, and which made them patterns to other churches (see below). —For this affliction in which they <i>received the word</i>, see Acts xvii. 5—10; ch. ii. 14; iii. 2, 3, 5. <h3><u><b>receiving</b>]</u></h3> i.e.<b>in that ye received.</b> <h3><u><b>joy of the Holy Spirit</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>joy wrought by the Holy Spirit.</b><h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Further specification of the eminence of the Thessalonians’ Christian character.</i><h3><u><b>an example</b>]</u></h3> said of the whole church as one. <h3><u><b>to all that believe</b>]</u></h3> <b>to the whole of the believers</b>: not as Chrysostom understands it, all that believed before you: for it was not so: the only church in Europe which was in Christ before the Thessalonian, was the Philippian (Acts xvi. 12— xvii. 1; see ch. ii. 2). <br><br><b>Macedonia and Achaia</b>, compare Rom. xv. 26; Acts xix. 21: the two Roman provinces, comprehending Northern and Southern Greece. There is no reference, as Theodoret thinks, to the <i>Greeks</i> being “very great nations, and admired for wisdom,” and so <i>their praise</i> being the greater: these are mentioned simply because the Apostle had been, since their conversion, in Macedonia, and had left Silvanus and Timothy there,—and was now in Achaia.<h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Proof of the praise in ver.</i>7.<br><br><b> from you</b> is merely local; not by you, as preachers. <h3><u><b>hath sounded out</b>]</u></h3> Chrysostom remarks that the similitude is from the clear sound of a trumpet, filling all the space surrounding.

These countrymen of the Thessalonians were not Jews, wholly nor in part, but Gentiles only. For they are set in distinct contrast here to <i>the Jews</i>.<br><br><b>they</b>, the members of the Judaean churches mentioned above.<h2><u><b>15, 16.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Characterization of the Jews as enemies of the Gospel and of mankind</i>. Jowett’s note is worth quoting: “Wherever the Apostle had gone on his second journey, he had been persecuted by the Jews: and the longer he travelled about among Gentile cities, the more he must have been sensible of the feeling with which his countrymen were regarded. Isolated as they were from the rest of the world in every city, a people within a people, it was impossible that they should not be united for their own self-defence, and regarded with suspicion by the rest of mankind. But their inner nature was not less repugnant to the nobler as well as the baser feelings of Greece and Rome. Their fierce nationality had outlived itself: though worshippers of the true God, they knew Him not to be the God of all the nations of the earth: hated and despised by others, they could but cherish in return an impotent contempt and hatred of other men. What wonder that, for an instant (? on all this see below), the Apostle should have felt that this Gentile feeling was not wholly groundless? or that he should use words which recall the expression of Tacitus, in characterizing the Jews,—‘that they had the hatred of enemies towards all other nations?’” <h2><u><b>15. killed Jesus the Lord</b>]</u></h2> The arrangement of the words in the original is peculiar, throwing “<i>the Lord</i>” into strong emphasis—Jesus who was their Lord, whom they ought to have welcomed and obeyed. <h3><u><b>drove out us</b>]</u></h3> by persecution, viz., from among you, Acts xvii. 5 ff. <h2><u><b>16.</b>]</u></h2> <b>us</b> refers to Paul and Silas. In the words <b>are contrary to all men</b>, most. Commentators, and recently Jowett (see above), have seen the “<i>hatred of the human race</i>,” ascribed to the Jews by Tacitus,and by several other classic authors. But it is hardly possible that St. Paul, himself a Jew, should have blamed an exclusiveness which arose from the strict monotheism and legal purity of the Jew: and besides this, the construction having been hitherto carried on by copulae, but now dropping them, most naturally goes on from this <i>contrariety</i> to what next follows, viz., <i>their forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles</i>, specifying wherein the contrariety consists, viz. in opposing the salvation of mankind by the Gospel.<h3><u><b>to the end that they may fill up their sins alway</b>]</u></h3> This is said, not of the intention of the Jews themselves, but of their course of conduct, viewed as having an intent in the divine purposes: as so often in St.Paul. The meaning of the expression is, that they may bring up the measure of their sins to the pre- scribed point. <b>But</b> (this their opposition to God and men shall not avail them : for) <b>the</b> (predestined, or predicted, or merited) <b>wrath</b> (of God) <b>came upon them</b> (he looks <i>back</i> on the fact in the divine counsels as a thing in past time, i.e. ‘was appointed to<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wivXHPynhWK8lOyNBXCdCecXvjqldIRG/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But he does not look forward to this as anticipating a reward for the conversion of the Thessalonians, or that their conversion will compensate for his having persecuted the Church before, but from generous desire to be found at that day with the fruits of his labour, and that they might be his boast and he theirs before the Lord; see 2 Cor. i. 14; Phil. ii. 16. <h2><u><b>20.</b>]</u></h2> The words <b>at his coming</b> further specify what went before: that it is not merely in His presence, always about His people, but then, when He shall be clearly and finally manifested. I should be inclined to ascribe to ver. 20 a wider range than ver. 19 embraces: as if it had been said, <b>you will be our joy in the day of the Lord: for ye are </b>(at all times, <i>ye are abstractedly</i>) <b>our glory and joy</b>.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DLqUGrDTxKkf5r62035yRo8e6Uk1UOIk/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It would be hardly possible that it should be so, unless some reason existed in the subjects of the verb.

Therefore <i>sanctification </i>must be taken in the most general sense, and that which is afterwards introduced, as forming a <i>part</i> of our <i>sanctification</i>. <h3><u><b>your sanctification</b>]</u></h3> i.e. <b>the </b> <b>sanctification of you</b>.<h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> On the meaning of the expression, <b>his own vessel</b>, there has been much difference. Very many Commentators understand it of ‘<i>the body</i>.’ But it is fatal to this interpretation, (1) that it must force an untenable meaning on the pre- ceding verb, which can only mean ‘<i>to acquire</i>,’ not, as in A. V., ‘<i>to possess</i>.’ Chrysostom, whose sense of Greek usage led him to feel this, tries to fit the mean- ing ‘<i>to acquire</i>’ into the sense: saying, “We do really <i>acquire</i> the body, when it remains pure, and is in sanctification ” (so Dr. Vaughan also). But this is lame enough, and would not, as De Wette remarks, answer for the other member of the sentence, “<i>not in the lust of carnal desire</i>.” (2) That the mere use of the word <b>vessel</b>, without any explanation, could hardly point at the <i>body</i>. In all the passages ordinarily quoted to support it, the metaphor is further explained by the context. 2 Cor. iv. 7 is evidently no case in point, the epithet “<i>earthen</i>” being there added, and the body being simply <i>compared </i> to an <i>earthen vessel</i>. (3) The order of the words in the original is against it, by which the whole stress is laid on the word <i>own</i>. This would be without meaning if “vessel” meant the body: for how could a man <i>acquire </i>another’s body? (4) But a more fatal objection than any of the former is, that the context is entirely against the meaning. The <i>sanctification</i> has been explained to consist in abstaining from <b>fornication</b>. And now this <i>fornication </i> comes to be specified, wherein it consists, and how it may be guarded against : viz. in carrying on the divinely-appointed commerce of the sexes in holiness and honour. In fact, the thought is exactly as in 1 Cor. vii. 2, “ <i>Because of fornications, </i> <i>let each man </i><b>have his own wife,</b> <i>and let each woman</i> <b>have her own husband.</b>” Many have therefore understood vessel in its literal meaning as applied to “<i>the matter</i>” in hand,—i.e. the <i>woman</i> (or indeed the <i>man</i>, on the other side, inasmuch as the woman has <i>power </i>over his body, see 1 Cor. vii. 4.—So that thus it would be an exhortation to the woman also). Thus the context would be satisfied, and the emphatic position of <b>his own</b> (as in 1 Cor. vii. 2);—and <b>acquire </b>would re- tain its proper meaning: <b>that each of you should know how to acquire his own vessel</b> (for this purpose) <b>in sanctification and honour</b>. This sense of <i>vessel </i>is found in the Jewish books; and the verb rendered “<i>acquire</i>” was commonly used of taking a wife. This interpretation is that of some of the principal among the ancients, including Augustine, and of many of the principal moderns. The objection to it alleged by Calvin and others, that<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ahadz3uvmn0mAzM5TlR2G5_x4GMqq8X-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

How some of the best modern Commentators can have entertained this view, I am at a loss to imagine. For (1) the sense is carried on from vv. 4, 5, without any thing to mark a change of topic: and (2) when the Apostle sums up the whole in ver. 7, he mentions merely impurity, without the slightest allusion to the other. To say that more than one kind of sin must be mentioned because he speaks of “ <i>all these things</i>” is mere trifling: this expression merely generalizes from the sin mentioned to a wider range. I understand the verse, with Chrysostom, and most of the ancients and moderns, to refer to the <i>sins of uncleanness</i>, and continue vv. 4, 5:—<b>that he should not</b> (viz. <b>any of you</b>, repeated from “<i>every one of you</i>” above)<b> go beyond</b> (or <b>set at nought</b>, which perhaps is more strictly accurate; but the word means both, and the other is perhaps best in English) <b>and overreach his brother in the</b> (i.e. this) <b>matter </b>(viz. of acquiring his own vessel—that there should be among you no strifes on account of the <i>lusts of carnal desire</i>. The matter, viz. which is now in hand: not,—nor can the words by any possibility mean, “<i>any matter</i>,” as A.V.: nor “<i>the business of life</i>,” as some have interpreted it: see above. “It is probable that the obscurity of the passage arises partly from the decency in which the Apostle clothes it.” Jowett): <b>because God is the avenger</b> (<i>‘righter</i>,’ in such cases of setting at nought and overreaching) <b>of all these things</b> (viz. cases of <i>going beyond and overreaching</i>, and by inference, lustful sins like them), <b>as also</b> (see on ver. 5) <b>we before told you and (constantly) testified</b>.<h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> This verse (see above) is in my view decisive for the above rendering of ver.6. There is no mention here of <i>avarice</i>: nor is it possible to understand the word <b>uncleanness</b>, when ver. 3 has gone before, of any thing but carnal impurity.<h3><u><b>for</b>]</u></h3> <b>for the purpose of,—on condition of:—in</b>, ‘in the element of.’<br><br><b>sanctification</b> is the whole sphere of our Christian life. <h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> Hence, the sin of (rejecting) setting at nought such limitations and rules is a fearful one—no less than that of setting at nought God the giver of the Holy Spirit. In the words <b>despiseth </b> <b>not man</b> there is an obvious allusion to <i>going beyond and overreaching</i> above. There is no need to supply any thing after <b>despiseth: he that despiseth</b> simply describes him who commits the act of despising, <b>the despiser</b>—<i>what</i> he despises, is not to be supplied in the construction, but is clear from the context—viz. <i>his brother</i>.<h3><u><b>who also gave</b>]</u></h3> i.e. who also is the AUTHOR of our sanctification. <br><br>By the word <b>also</b> new force is given to the matter to be mentioned. It introduces a climax, whereby the sin is intensified. <br><br><b>gave</b>—not <i>giveth</i>—once for all, as being one great definite act of God by his Son.<h3><u><b>his Spirit, which is holy</b>]</u></h3> I have retained here the form of the original rather than<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18caCx2EQ614DwrP5qAVm25Q-Q4l-zGHz/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It conveys tacit but gentle reproof. The knowledge and the practice already exist: but the latter is not quite in pro- portion to the former. “In saying, ‘there is no need,’ he makes it greater than if he had said, ‘ there was need.’” Chrysostom.<h2><u><b>10.</b>]</u></h2> follows up the last verse by a matter of fact, shewing the teaching to have been in some measure effectual. <br><br><b>to abound</b>, viz. in this <i>love</i>. <br><br>There does not seem any reason, with Jowett, to ascribe the want of quietness, here implied,<b> to be quiet</b>, to their <i>uneasiness about the state of the dead</i>: much rather [as he also states: see below] to their mistaken anticipations of the immediate coming of the Lord. It would seem as if, notwithstanding their liberality to those without, there were some defect of diligence and harmony within which prompted this exhortation: see 2 Thess. iii. 11, 12. Theodoret assigns another reason for it: “This exhortation is not inconsistent with the foregoing praises. For the state of things was, that one party zealously ministered charity to the needy, and that the latter on account of this zealous ministration neglected their own duties: he naturally therefore praised the one and gave fitting advice to the others.” It has been objected to this, that thus the Church would be divided into two sections, the one exhorted to persist and abound in their liberality, the other to work diligently to support themselves ; whereas there is no trace in the text of such a division. But we may well answer, that instances are frequent enough of exhortations being addressed to whole churches which in their application would require severing and allotting to distinct classes of persons.<h2><u><b>11.</b>]</u></h2> <b>to study</b> (literally,<b> to make it your ambition</b>) <b>to be quiet</b>—have no other <i>ambition</i> than that of a quiet industrious holy life.

It would certainly seem as if the preaching of the kingdom of Jesus at Thessalonica had been partially misunderstood, and been perverted into a cause why they should not quietly follow active life, and why they should be uneasy about those who fell asleep before that kingdom was brought in, imagining that they would have no part in its glories. Compare Acts xvii. 7. <h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> <b>we</b> (or <b>I</b>) <b>would not have you ignorant</b> .... is with our Apostle (compare Rom. i. 13; xi, 25; 1 Cor. x. 1; xii. 1; 2 Cor. i. 8) a common formula of transition to the imparting of weighty information.<h3><u><b>them which are sleeping</b>]</u></h3> This was an expression (see reff.) conveying definite meaning to the Thessalonians as importing <i>the dead in Christ</i> (ver. 16). No inference must therefore be drawn from the Apostle’s use of this word, as to the intermediate state: for the word is a mere common term. <h3><u><b>that ye may not sorrow</b>]</u></h3> object of my not wishing you to be ignorant.<br><br>The word <b>sorrow </b>is <i>absolute</i>, <b>that ye mourn not at all</b>:—not to be joined with what follows, and to be made only to mean that. ye sorrow not in the same manner as &c. He forbids <b>mourning</b> altogether. But we must remember, <i>what sort of mourning</i> it was. It was mourning for <i>them</i>: not mourning for <i>our</i> loss in their <i>absence</i>, but for <i>theirs</i>, and <i>in so far</i>, for ours also.<h3><u><b>the rest</b>]</u></h3> viz. the heathen, and those <b>Jews</b> who did not believe a resurrection.<h3><u><b>have no hope</b>]</u></h3> viz. in the <i>resurrection</i>. Examples of this “<i>no hope</i>” are easily given from the Pagan writers. Lünemann cites,—Theocritus, “Hope goes with life —all hopeless are the dead.” Æschylus, “Once dead, there is no resurrection more.” Catullus, “Suns may set and may return: | We, when once our brief light wanes, | Have eternal night to sleep.” Lucretius, “None ever woke again | Whom the cold pause of life hath overta’en.” Jowett adds ‘the sad complaints of Cicero and Quintilian over the loss of their children, and the dreary hope of an immortality of fame in Tacitus and Thucydides.’ This shews of <i>what kind</i> their <i>mourning </i>was: viz. a grief whose ground was unbelief in a resurrection: which regarded the dead as altogether cut off from Christ’s heavenly kingdom.<h2><u><b>14.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Substantiation </i>(<b>for</b>) <i>of that implied in last verse, that further knowledge will remove this their grief</i>: and that knowledge, grounded on the resurrection of our Lord. <h3><u><b>if</b>]</u></h3> not ‘<i>seeing that</i> :’ but hypothetical: ‘<i>supposing</i>, that we, &c.’<br><br><b>died and rose again</b> go together,— forming the same process through which ‘<i>the sleeping</i>’ are passing. “The Apostle here, as always, uses the direct term ‘died’ in reference to our Lord, to obviate all possible misconception : in reference to the faithful he appropriately uses the consolatory term ‘<i>sleep</i>.’” Ellicott. <h3><u><b>even so</b>]</u></h3> The two clauses do not accurately correspond. We should expect “<i>we believe also that even thus they who fell asleep through Jesus will rise again</i>,” or the like. Still the <b>even so</b> betokens identity of lot for the two parties concerned, viz. death, and resurrection. In this they resemble: but in the expressed particulars here, they differ.

Cor. xi. 23; xv. 3, and notes.<h3><u><b>we which are living</b>]</u></h3> Then beyond question, he himself expected to be alive, together with the majority of those to whom he was writing, at the Lord’s coming. For we cannot for a moment accept the evasion of Theodoret (so also Chrysostom and the majority of ancient Commentators, down to Bengel, and even some of the best of the moderns, warped by their subjectivities: even Ellicott here),—“ that he said this not in his own person, but in that of the men who should be surviving at that time (!)”— nor the ungrammatical rendering of some, ‘we, if we live and remain’—nor the idea of Œcumenius, al., that <i>we who live</i> are the <i>souls</i>, <i>they who sleep the bodies</i> :—but must take the words in their only plain grammatical meaning, that <b>we which are living, who remain behind</b>, are a class distinguished from <b>them which fell asleep</b>, by being yet in the flesh when Christ comes, in which class, by prefixing <b>we</b>, he includes his readers and himself. That this <i>was </i>his expextation, we know from other passages, especially from 2 Cor. v. 1—10, where see notes. It does not seem to have been so strong towards the end of his course; see e. g. Phil. —26. Nor need it surprise any Christian, that the Apostles should in this matter of detail have found their personal expectations liable to disappointment, respecting a day of which it is so solemnly said, that no man knoweth its appointed time, not the angels in heaven, nor the Son (Mark xiii. 32), but the Father only. At the same time it must be borne in mind, that this inclusion of himself and his hearers among the “<i>living and remaining behind</i>” does not in any way enter into the fact revealed and here announced, which is re- specting that class of persons only as they are, and must be, <i>one portion</i> of the faithful at the Lord’s coming: not respecting the question, <i>who shall</i>, and <i>who shall not</i> be among them in that day.<br><br><b>shall in no wise</b> (emphatic—; there is no reason to fear, that we shall . . . .’) <b>gain an advantage over </b>(literally, <i>get before</i>, <i>outstrip</i>, <i>anticipate</i>: in the old sense of the word, <i>prevent</i>, so that they be left behind, and fail of the prize).<h2><u><b>16.</b>]</u></h2> <i>A reason of the foregoing assertion, </i> <i>by detailing the method of the resurrection</i>. <b>Because the Lord Himself</b> (said for solemnity’s sake, and to shew that it will not be a <i>mere gathering to</i> Him, but HE HIMSELF will descend, and we all shall be summoned before Him) <b>with</b> (literally, ‘in, as the element,—the accompanying circumstance) <b>a signal-shout</b> (the word signifies primarily not only ‘<i>the shout of battle</i>,’ as Conybeare ; but is used of any signal given by the voice, whether of a captain to his rowers, of a man shouting to another at a distance, of a huntsman to his dogs.

That he advances no further in the prophetic description, but breaks off at our union in Christ’s presence, is accounted for, by his purpose being accomplished, in having shewn that they who have died in Christ, shall not be thereby deprived of any advantage at His coming. The rest of the great events of that time—His advent on this earth, His judgment of it, assisted by His saints (1 Cor. vi. 2, 3),—His reign upon earth,— His final glorification with His redeemed in heaven,—are not treated here, but not therefore to be conceived of as alien from the Apostle’s teaching. <h2><u><b>18.</b>]</u></h2> <b>So then:</b> seeing that this is so. <br><br><b>these words,</b> which I have by inspiration delivered to you. It will be manifest to the plain, as well as to the scholar-like reader, that attempts, like that of Mr. Jowett, to interpret such a passage as this by the rules of mere figurative language, are entirely beside the purpose. The Apostle’s declarations here are made in the practical tone of strict matter of fact, and are given as literal details, to console men’s minds under an existing difficulty. Never was a place where the analogy of symbolical apocalyptic language was less applicable. Either these details must be received by us as matter of practical expectation, or we must set aside the Apostle as one divinely empowered to teach the Church. It is a fair opportunity for a crucial experiment, to test Christian faith and unbelief: and such test cannot be evaded by Mr. Jowett’s intermediate expedient of figurative language.<h2><u>CH, V.<b>1—11.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Exhortation to watch Sor the day of the Lord’s coming, and to be ready for it</i>. <h2><u><b>1—3.</b>]</u></h2> <i>the suddenness and unexpectedness of that day’s coming</i>.<h2><u><b>1.</b>]</u></h2> On <b>times</b> and <b>seasons</b>, see Acts i. 7, note.

The vivid description dispenses with any copula. <h3><u><b>cometh upon them</b>]</u></h3> The Greek word is generally used of any sudden unexpected appearance: as for example in Luke xxi. 34: Acts iv. 1.—It is pressing too close the comparison which follows, when De Wette says that it “ assumes the day to be <i>near</i>,—for that such a woman, though she does not know the day and the hour, yet has a definite knowledge of the <i>period</i> :” for it is not the woman, nor her condition, that is the subject of comparison, but the <i>unexpected</i> <i>pang</i> of labour which comes on her.<h2><u><b>4,5.</b>]</u></h2> But the Thessalonians, and Christians in general, are not to be thus over- taken by it. <h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> <b>in darkness</b> refers back to “<i>in the night</i>” above—in the ignorance and moral slumber of the world which knows not God. Not, ‘<i>that</i> day,’ but the DAY—the meaning of the <b>day</b> as distinguished from <b>the darkness</b> being brought out, and <i>the day</i> being put in the place of emphasis accordingly. That this is so, is plain from what follows, ver. 5. <h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2> You (a) and all we Christians (b) have no reason to fear, and no excuse for being surprised by, the DAY of the Lord: for <b>we are sons of light and the day </b>(signifying that we <i>belong to</i>, having our origin from, the light and the day), <b>and are not of </b>(do not supply ‘<i>sons</i>’ —the genitives signify <i>possession</i>—<b>we belong not to</b>) <b>night nor darkness</b>.

And this not only in being awake and sober, but in being <i>armed</i> — not only watchful, but as sentinels, on our guard, and <i>guarded </i>ourselves. Notice, that these arms are defensive only, as against a sudden attack—and belong therefore not so much to the Christian’s conflict with evil, as (from the context) to his guard against being surprised by the day of the Lord as a thief in the night. The best defences against such a surprise are the three great Christian graces, Faith, Hope, Love,— which are accordingly here enumerated : see ch. i. 3, and 1 Cor. xiii. 13. In Eph. vi. 13—17, we have offensive as well as defensive weapons, and the symbolism is somewhat varied, the <i>breastplate</i> being <i>righteousness</i>, <i>faith</i> being the <i>shield</i>; while the helmet remains the same. See on the figure, Isa. lix. 17; Wisd. v. 17 ff. We must not perhaps press minutely the meaning of each part of the armour, in the presence of such variation in the two pas- sages.<h2><u><b>9.</b>]</u></h2> Explanation of the “<i>hope of salvation</i>,”—‘ and we <i>may</i> with confidence put on such an hope as our helmet’ —<b>For God set us not</b> (‘appointed <b>us</b> not’ {reff.]; keep the historical past meaning,— referring to the time when He made the appointment) <b>to</b> (‘ <i>with a view to</i>’—so as to issue in, become a prey to)<b>wrath, but to acquisition </b> <b>of salvation through</b> (<b>through...</b> refers to “<i>acquisition of salvation</i>,” not to “ <i>appointed</i>”) <b>our Lord Jesus Christ</b>, <b>10.</b>] <b>who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep</b> (in what sense? surely not in an ethical sense, as above: for they who sleep will be overtaken by Him as a thief, and His day will be to them darkness, not light. If not in an ethical sense, it must be in that of <i>living</i> or <i>dying</i>, and the sense as Rom. xiv. 8. For we cannot adopt the trifling sense given by Whitby, al.,—‘whether He come in the night, and so find us taking our natural rest, or in the day when we are waking.’ Thus understood however, it will be at the sacrifice of perspicuity, seeing that the words <b>wake</b> and <b>sleep</b> have been used ethically throughout the passage. If we wish to preserve the uniformity of metaphor, we <i>may</i> [though I am not satisfied with this] interpret in this sense: that our Lord died for us, that whether we watch [are of the number of the watchful, i.e. already Christians] or sleep [are of the number of the sleeping, i.e. unconverted] we should live, &c. Thus it would be equivalent to, ‘who died that all men might be saved :’ who came, not to call the righteous only, but sinners to life. There is to this interpretation the great objection that it confounds with the “<i>rest</i>” the “<i>we</i>,” who are definitely spoken of as set by God not to wrath but to <i>the obtaining </i> <i>of salvation</i>. So that the sense <b>live or die</b>, must, I think, be accepted. and the want of perspicuity with it). <h2><u><b>together</b>: not to be joined to “<i>with Him</i>.” <b>11.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Conclusion from the whole</i>—<b>Wherefore</b>, seeing that these things are so.<h2><u><b>12—24.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Miscellaneous exhortations, ending with a solemn wish for their perfection</i> <i>in the day of Christ.</i> <h2><u><b>12, 13.</b>]</u></h2> <i>In reference to their duties to the rulers of the church among them.</i> The connexion (<b>but</b>, a slight contrast with that which has just passed) seems to he this: that, as the duty of comforting and building up one another has just been mentioned, the transition is now made to those whose<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C5v7KXVCWyTGG6SRNkL1VsYxcR4ENhwX/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Compare 2 Tim. ii. 19: also 1 Cor. xvi. 18.—The persons indicated by them <b>which labour . . . pre- side... admonish ...</b>, are the same, viz. the <i>presbyters </i>or <i>bishops</i>: sce note on Acts xx. 17, 28. <br><br><b>in the Lord</b>, as the element in which, the matter with regard to which, their presidency takes place: ‘in divine things.’ <h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> <b>very highly </b>is best taken with <i>in Jove</i>: it will not form a suitable qualification for the verb <b>esteem</b>, as that word is used in the original.<br><br><b>for their work’s sake</b> may mean, <b>because of the</b> <i>nature </i><b>of their work</b>, viz. that it is the Lord’s work, for your souls: or, <b>on account of their activity in their office</b>, as a recompense for their work. Both these motives are combined in Heb. xiii. 17. This exhortation,<b> be at peace among yourselves</b>, seems to be suggested by the foregoing, as enforcing peaceful and loving subordination without party strife: see the mention of the <i>unruly</i> below.<h2><u><b>14—22.</b>]</u></h2><i> General exhortations with regard </i> <i>to Christian duties</i>. There appears no reason for regarding these verses as addressed to the presbyters, as some have done. They are for <i>all</i>: for each to interpret according to the sphere of his own duties. By the word <b>brethren</b>, he continues the same address as above.<h2><u><b>14. disorderly</b>]</u></h2> This, as ch. iv. 11, 2 Thess. iii. 6, 11, certainly implies that there was reason to complain of this <b>disorder </b>in the Thessalonian church. The original word is especially said of the soldier who does not remain in his rank: hence <b>disorderly</b>.<h3><u><b>fainthearted</b>]</u></h3> such e.g. as needed the comfort of ch. iv. 13 ff. <h3><u><b>support</b>]</u></h3> literally, <b>keep hold of</b>. <br><br><b>the weak</b> must, be understood of the spiritually weak, not the literally sick. <h2><u><b>15.</b>]</u></h2> This gives a slight warning that the practice might creep on them unawares. It is not addressed to any particular section of the church, but to all: to each for himself, and the church for each. <h2><u><b>16.</b>]</u></h2> Chrysostom refers this to ver. 15: “When we have such a disposition as to hurt no one but to do good to all, whence can the sting of grief enter? For he who so joys in being injured as to requite his injurer by good offices, whence shall he receive annoyance for the future?” But perhaps this is somewhat far-fetched. The connexion seems however to be justified as he proceeds: “And how, means the Apostle, is this possible? if we will, it is possible. And then he shews the way: ‘pray unceasingly’ &c.” And so Theophylact : “ For one accustomed to converse with God and to give thanks to Him for all that happens, as good for him, will clearly pos- sess unbroken joy.” <h2><u><b>17.</b>]</u></h2> See Chrysostom and Theophylact above. <br><br><b>pray</b>, not of the mere spirit of prayer, as Jowett :<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lIbAZBKp_gmeiksBbGbJhmxNxIA2smaA/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But there can be no doubt that the <i>supernatural </i>agency of the Spirit is here alluded to,—the speaking in tongues, &c., as in 1 Cor. xii. 7 ff. It is conceived of as a flame, which may be checked and quenched: hence the “fervent (boiling)<i> in the Spirit</i>” of Acts xviii. 25; Rom. xii. 11. <h2><u><b>20.</b>]</u></h2> On <b>prophesyings</b> see 1 Cor. xii. 10, note. They were liable to be despised in comparison with the more evidently miraculous gift of tongues: and hence in 1 Cor. xiv. 5, &c. he takes pains to shew that prophecy was in reality the greater gift. <h2><u><b>21.</b>]</u></h2> This refers back to the foregoing: <b>but try all</b> (such <b>spiritual gifts</b>): see 1 Cor. xii.10; xiv. 29; 1 John iv. 1. <br><br><b>hold fast that which is good</b> is best regarded as beginning a new sentence, and opposed to that which follows: not however as disconnected from the preceding, but suggested by it. In this, and in all things, <b>hold fast the good</b>.<h2><u><b>22.</b>]</u></h2> These words cannot by any possibility be rendered as in A. V., ‘<i>abstain from all appearance of evil</i>.’ For (1) the Greek word (<i>eidos</i>) never signifies ‘ <i>appearance</i>’ in this sense : (2) the two members of the sentence would thus not be logically correspondent, but a new idea would be introduced in the second which has no place in the context: for it is not against being deceived by false <i>appearance</i>, nor against giving occasion by behaviour which <i>appears like </i>evil, that he is cautioning them, but merely to distinguish and hold fast that which is good, and reject that which is evil. The Greek word means the <i>species</i>, as subordinated to the <i>genus </i>:—<b>abstain from every species</b> (or <b>form</b>) <b>of evil</b>.<h2><u><b>23, 24.</b>]</u></h2> <b>But may the God of peace Himself</b>— contrast to all these feeble endeavours on your own part. <br><br><b>peace</b>, here most probably in its wider sense, as the accomplishment of all these Christian graces, and result of the avoidance of all evil. It seems rather far-fetched to refer it back to ver. 13. <br><br><b>wholly </b>(in original, <b>entire</b>, an adjective, agreeing with <b>you</b>) seems to refer to the entireness of sanctification, which is presently expressed in detail. <br><br><b>and </b>introduces the detailed expression of the same wish from the lower side—in its effects. <h3><u><b>spirit and soul and body</b>]</u></h3> The SPIRIT (<i>pneuma</i>) is the highest and distinctive part of man, the immortal and responsible <i>soul</i>, in our common parlance: the SOUL is the lower or animal soul, containing the passions and desires which we have in common with the brutes, but which in <i>us </i>is ennobled and drawn up by the <i>spirit</i>. That St. Paul had these distinctions in mind, is plain from such places as 1 Cor. ii. 14. The spirit, that part whereby we are receptive of the Holy Spirit of God, is, in the unspiritual man, crushed down and subordinated to the animal soul (<i>psyché</i>): he therefore is called “a <i>psychic man</i>, not having a spirit,” Jude 19: see also note on 1 Cor. as above. <br><br><b>in the coming</b>,—for it will be <i>in </i>that day that the result will be seen, —that <i>the having been kept whole without blame</i> will be accomplished.<h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Assurance, from God's faithfulness, </i> <i>that it will be so</i>. <br><br><b>Faithful</b>, i.e. <b>true </b>to His word and calling. <br><br><b>he that</b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V7bMLAfpKnPptKpS8woJH0dotxN5cm8I/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Let no pretended saying, no pretended epistle of mine, shake you in this matter. That there were such, is shewn by this parallel position of the clauses with by spirit, which last agency certainly was among them. Sayings, and an epistle, to this effect, were ascribed to the Apostle. So Chrysostom: “He seems to me here to hint, that some were going about with a forged Epistle pretending to be from Paul, and that shewing this they affirmed the day of the Lord to be already come, that they might deceive many.”— However improbable this may seem, our expression would seem hardly to bear legitimately any other meaning. Compare also ch. iii. 17, and note.

Besides which, we may without presumption say, St. Paul could not have so written, nor could the Spirit have so spoken by him. The teaching of the Apostles was, and of the Holy Spirit in all ages has been, that the day of the Lord <i>is at hand</i>. But these Thessalonians imagined it to be already come, and accordingly were deserting their pursuits in life, and falling into other irregularities, as if the day of grace were closed. So Chrysostom plainly, “The devil, when he could not persuade them that the announcements of things future were false, took another way, and having suborned certain pestilent fellows, endeavoured to deceive by persuading them that those great and glorious events had an end, At one time they said that the resurrection was already past : but in this case they<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vHi7DxPPPoN7if49rIPaB4RieM36r6U-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It seems merely to refer to Antichrist himself, whose essence and inheritance is <i>perdition</i>, —not to his influence over others); <b>he that withstandeth</b> (the expression is absolute, ‘<i>he that withstands</i> CHRIST,’ the <b>anti</b>-christ, 1 John ii. 18), <b>and exalteth himself above </b>(in a hostile sense)<b> every one that is called God </b>(compare a similar expression, 1 Cor. viii. 5. “The expression includes the <i>true</i> God, as well as the false ones of the heathen—but <b>that is called</b> is a natural addition from Christian caution, as ‘<i>every God</i>’ would have been a senseless and indeed blasphemous expression for a Christian.” Lünemann), <b>or an object of adoration</b> (compare the close parallel in Dan. xi. 36, 37. Notice, that the meaning of these words cannot by any probability be fulfilled by any one who, as the Pope, creates objects of worship, and thus (by inference merely) makes himself greater than the objects which he creates: but it is required that this Antichrist should <i>set</i> HIMSELF <i>up as an object of worship</i>, above, and as superior to, “ every one that is called God or worshipped ”) ; <b>so that he sits in</b> (enters into, sets himself down in, and remains in) <b>the temple of God</b> (this, say some Commentators, cannot be any other than <i>the temple at Jerusalem</i>: on account of the definiteness of the expression, <b>sits in the temple of God</b>. But there is no force in this. <i>The temple of God</i> is used metaphorically by St. Paul in 1 Cor. iii. 17: and why not here? see also 1 Cor. vi. 16 ; Eph. ii. 21. From these passages it is plain that such figurative sense was familiar to the Apostle. And if so, the <i>sitting</i> makes no difficulty. Its figurative sense, as holding a place of power, sitting as judge or ruler, is more frequent still : see in St. Paul, 1 Cor. vi. 4: and Matt. xxiii. 2: Rev. xx.4: to which indeed we might add the many places where our Lord is said to <i>sit </i>on the right hand of God, e.g. Heb.i. 3; viii. 1; x. 12; xii. 2; Rev. iii. 21.

For what hope remains, when shame in sinners is gone?” Grotius gives it a different turn: “lest, being branded by contumelies, he seek to avenge himself.” These, and many other references, may well be contained in the expression, and we need not, I think, be at the pains precisely to specify any one direction which the evil would take. Such an one’s steps would be shackled—his freedom hampered—his tem- per irritated—his character lost—and the natural result would be a fall from his place, to the detriment not of himself only, but of the church of Christ).<h2><u><b>8—13.</b>]</u></h2><b> </b><i>Precepts regarding deacons and deaconesses</i> (see below on ver. 11).<h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> <b>In like manner</b> (this expression seems introduced by the similarity of character, —not merely to mark an additional particular) <b>the deacons</b> (mentioned as a class, besides here, only <b>Phil. i. 1,</b> where as here, they follow the “<i>bishops</i>.” Phoebe, Rom. xvi. 1, is a “ <i>deacon</i>[<i>ess</i>] ” of the church at Cenchreæ. The term or its cognates occur in a vaguer sense, but still indicating a special office, in Rom. xii. 7; 1 Pet. iv. 11. The connexion of the ecclesiastical deacons with the seven appointed in Acts vi.is very doubtful: see Chrysostom’s and (Ecumenius’s testimony distinguishing them, in note there. But that the ecclesiastical order sprung out of similar necessities, and had for its field of work similar objects, can hardly be doubted) <b>(must be) grave, not of double speech</b> (this may mean, either, saying one thing and thinking another, or, which is more probable, as carrying out better the idea of <i>double speech</i>, saying one thing to one man and another thing to another, the two sayings being inconsistent. with singleness of conviction and purpose), <b>not addicted</b> (applying themselves) <b>to much wine</b> (see Tit. ii. 3), <b>not greedy of gain</b> (hardly, as A.

I conceive we may dismiss (4) at once, for Chrysostom’s reason: “ Why should he in the midst of writing on another subject insert any thing respecting <i>women</i> ?”—(3) upheld by Calvin and others, may for the same reason, seeing that he returns to the deacons again in ver. 12, be characterized as extremely improbable : —(2) has found many supporters among modern Commentators: and it is the rendering of the A.

But it has against it(<i>a</i>) the omission in the original of all expressed reference to the deacons: (<i>b</i>) the expression <b>in like manner</b>, by which the <i>deacons</i> themselves were introduced in ver. 8, and which seems to mark a new ecclesiastical class: (<i>c</i>) the introduction of the injunction respecting the deacons in ver. 12, as a new particular, which would hardly be if their wives had been mentioned before: (<i>d</i>) the circumstance connected with the mention of Phœbe as <i>deaconess</i> of the Church at Cenchreæ in Rom. xvi. 1, that unless these are deacon- esses, there would be among these injunctions no mention of an important class of persons employed as officers of the church. We come thus to consider (1), that these women are <i>deaconesses,— ministræ,</i> as Pliny calls them in his letter to Trajan [see note on Rom. xvi. 1]. In this view the ancients are as far as I know unanimous: and it is held by some of the ablest among the moderns. It is alleged against it—(a) that thus the return to the <i>deacons,</i> verse 12, would be harsh, or, as Conybeare says, “on that view the verse is most. unnaturally interpolated in the midst of the discussion concerning the deacons.” But the ready answer to this is found in Chrysostom’s view of ver. 12, that under the word deacons, and their household duties, he comprehends in fact both sexes under one: (b) that the existence of dea- conesses as an order in the ministry is after all not so clear. To this it might be answered, that even were they nowhere else mentioned, the present passage stands on its own grounds; and if it seemed from the context that such persons were indicated here, we should reason from this to the fact of their existence, not from the absence of other mention to their non-indication here.

(1) Very many, both ancients and moderns, understand it of a <i>degree of ecclesiastical preferment,</i> as that from the office of deacon to that of presbyter, and take “good” for a comparative. Against this is (a) the foreing of the word “<i>good ;</i>” (b) the improbability that such a rise upwards through the ecclesiastieal offices was known in the Apostle’s time: (c) the still greater unlikelihood, even if it were known, that he would propose as a motive to a deacon to fulfil his office well, the ambitions desire to rise out of it. (2)Some among the moderns, following Calvin and Luther, understand by it a high place of honour in the esteem of the church. Against this is (a) that there is not a more distinct reference made to the estimation of the church: (b) that thus again an unworthy motive would be set before the deacons: (c) that again [see below] “ <i>great boldness,</i>” or “<i>confidence,</i>” will not on this interpretation, bear any legitimate rendering: (d) the use of the past, they who served: see above. (3) Some take it <i>spiritually,</i> as meaning <i>progress in the faith</i>. But (a) the whole is of too objective a character thus to be interpreted of a merely subjective process—besides that (b) thus also we should require <i>“are serving,” present, instead of “served,” past.</i> (4) Theodoret and others understand it nearly as above—of the station or standing-place which the faithful deacon acquires before God, with reference to his own salvation. The opinions of these Commentators are, however, somewhat various as to the exact time to which the standing on this <i>standing-place</i> is to be referred. Theodoret refers it to the next life. Others understand that they procure to themselves a <i>good expectation of salvation : a standing- place,</i> i.e., in <i>this life, with reference</i> to the future one. I believe that the truth will be found by combining the two views. The past verb, <b>served,</b> as above stated, is used with reference to their finished course at that day. The term are obtain- ing transfers the scene to the present time. The <b>standing-place</b> is that which they are now securing for themselves, and will be found standing on at that day: belonging therefore in part to both periods, and not necessarily involving the idea of different degrees of blessedness, though that idea [see 1 Cor. iii. 15] is familiar to St. Paul,—but merely predicating the soundness of the ground on which these <i>deacons</i> will themselves stand), and much confidence (this also is variously understood, according as the <i>standing-place</i> is interpreted.

(1) Some of the modern Commentators break up the sentence, putting a period at “<i>the living God,</i>” and proceeding, the pillar and ground of the truth, and without controversy great is the mystery, &c. To this I can only say, that if any one imagines St. Paul, or any other person capable of writing this Epistle, able to have indited such a sentence, I fear there is but little chance in arguing with him on the point in question. To say nothing of its abruptness and harshness, beyond all example even in these Epistles, how palpably does it betray the botching of modern conjectural arrangement in the wretched anti-climax—<i>the pillar and basement </i>[rising in solemnity] <i>of the truth</i>, <i>and</i> [what grander idea, after the basement of the whole building, does the reader suppose about to follow?] <i>without controversy great!</i> These two last words, which have [see below] their appropriate majesty and grandeur in their literal use at the emphatic opening of such a sentence as the next, are thus robbed of it all, and sink into the very lowest bathos; the metaphor being dropped, and the lofty imagery ending with a vague generality. If a sentence like this occurred in the Epistle, I should feel it a weightier argument against its genuineness than any which its opponents have yet adduced. (2) By Gregory of Nyssa among the ancients, and by some moderns, among whom are Chillingworth and Conybeare, it is taken as referring to TIMOTHY:—<i>“that thou mayest know how to conduct thyself in the house of God, which is, &c....as a pillar and basement of the truth.”</i> Some of the Fathers seem also to have favoured the idea: but of these we must manifestly not claim for it those who have merely used the word pillar or column of an Apostle or teacher, or individual Christian, —as that is justified, independently of our passage, by Gal. ii. 9; Rev. iii. 12.Gregory of Nazianzum applies the very words to Eusebius of Samosata, and to Basil: and Basil in the Catena says, the Apostles also are pillars of Jerusalem, as it is said, “the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15CtuBeCi-lgGSq9PgIZBl9n721RWptnh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

On both of these I shall treat expressly below.—Grammatically (see my Greek Test.) there is no objection to this view.—But to the sentence itself thus arranged and understood, there are weighty, and I conceive fatal objections, arising from the form of the clauses in the original. In this case also, the words, <i>“and without controversy,”</i> which follow, would most naturally refer, not to the great deposit of faith in Christ which is entrusted to the church to keep,—but to the very strong and unusual expression which had just been used of a young minister in the church,—‘ and confessedly great is the dignity of the least of the ministers of Christ: for,’ &c. (3) The reference to THE CHURCH is upheld by Chrysostom, Theodoret, &c., the Roman Commentators,—Luther,Calvin, Beza, Grotins, &c., &c. And this interpretation agrees with 2 Tim. ii. 19: see note there, But there is brought against it the objection, that there is thus introduced confusion of metaphor. The <i>church,</i> which was the <i>house</i> just now, becomes <i>a pillar,</i> a part of the <i>house,</i> This is not difficult to answer. The house contains in itself both <i>pillar</i> and <i>basement</i>—the pillar and the basement both belong to the house. Why may not the pillar be taken collectively ? the very word <i>church</i> or <i>congregation</i>, occurring since, has pluralized the idea—the building consists of the <i>faithful,</i> who are so many <i>Pillars</i>—why should it not in the aggregate e described as <i>the</i> <i>pillar? </i>The way in which the congregation of the faithful is the pillar and basement of the truth is admirably given by Theodoret : “He calls the assembly of the faithful the house and. church of God. These he names the pillar and basement of the truth. For they remain founded fixedly and immoveably on the rock, and proclaiming by their actions the truths of the doctrines:” viz. in that it is the element in which and medium by which the truth is conserved and upheld), <h2><u><b>16.</b>]</u></h2><b> And </b>(follows on the preceding: it is indeed worth all thy care to conduct thyself worthily in this house of God—for that truth which is there conserved and upheld is great and glorious above all others, being [see below] none other in fact than THE LORD HIMSELF, in all His gracious manifestation and glorious triumph) <b>confessedly</b> (‘as is acknowledged on all hands’) <b>great is the mystery</b> (see ver. 9: that which was hidden from man until God revealed it, historically, in Redemption) <b>of godliness</b> (see ch. ii, 2, note: ‘of the religious life.’—In order to comprehend fully what follows, we must endeavour to realize the train of thought in the Apostle’s mind at the time. This <i>‘mystery’</i> of the life of God in man, is in fact the unfolding of Christ to and in him: the key-text to our passage being Col. i. 27, <i>“To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this </i>MYSTERY<i> among the Gentiles:</i> WHICH IS, CHRIST AMONG YOU THE HOPE OF GLORY.” This was the thought in St. Paul’s mind; that the great revelation of the religious life is, CHRIST. And in accordance with his practice in these Epistles, written, as I believe, far on in his course, and after the figures and results of deep spiritual thoughts had been long familiar to him, he at once without explanation, or apology as beforetime in Col. i. 27, or expression of the word <i>Christ</i>, justifying the change of gender in the relative, joins the deep and latent thought with the superficial and obvious one, and without saying that the mystery <i>is in</i> <i>fact</i> Christ, passes from the mystery to the Person of Christ as being one and the same. Then, thus passing, he is naturally led to a summary of those particulars wherein Christ has been revealed as a ground for the godly recognition of His Church. And, idea of MYSTERY being prominent before him, he selects especially those events in and by which Christ was manifested forth—came forth from that secrecy in which he had beforetime been hidden in the counsels of God, and shone out to men and angels as the Lord of life and glory.

V., and so strenuously, even to this day, upheld by some. It is not the objective fact of <i>God being manifested,</i> of which the Apostle is speaking, but <i>the life of God lived in the church,</i>—the truth, of which the congregation of believers is the pillar and basement, —as identical [John xiv. 6] with Him who is its centre and heart and stock —as unfolded once for all in the unfolding of Him. The intimate and blessed link, furnished by the relative pronoun WHO, assuring the Church that it is not they that live, but Christ that liveth in them, is lost, if we understand <i>the mystery</i> merely as a fact, however important, historically revealed. There is hardly a passage in the New Test. in which I feel more deep personal thankfulness for the restoration of the true and wonderful connexion of the original text)<b>—who</b> (thus, and not ‘which,’ nor ‘He who,’ should we render, preserving the same transition, from the mystery, to Him of whom now all that follows is spoken. <i>Who</i> is, as stated in Ellicott, “a relative to an omitted though easily recognized antecedent, viz. Christ”) <b>was manifested in the flesh </b>(it has been often maintained of late, that these sentences, from their parallelism and symmetry, are taken from some hymn or confession of the ancient church. We cannot absolutely say that it may not have been so: but I should on all grounds regard it as very doubtful. I can see no reason why the same person who wrote the rhetorical passages, Rom. viii. 38, 39; xi. 33—36: 1 Cor. xiii. 4—7, and numerous others, might not, difference of time and modified mental characteristics being allowed for, have written this also. Once written, it would be sure to gain a place among the choice and treasured sayings of the Church, and might easily find its way into liturgical use: but I should be most: inclined to think that we have here its first expression. The reason which some of the above Commentators adduce for their belief,—the abrupt insulation of the clauses disjoined from the thought in the context, has no weight with me: I on the other hand feel that so beautiful and majestic a sequence of thoughts springing directly from the context itself, can hardly be a fragment pieced in, but must present the free expansion of the mind of the writer in the treatment of his subject. On the sense of this clause, compare John i. 14,— and 2 Tim.i.10. This is put first in the rank, as being the preliminary to all the rest. It is followed by the next clause, because the assertion and assurance of Christ’s perfect unsinning righteousness was the aim of his manifestation in our flesh all those thirty years which preceded His public ministry : see below), <b>was justified</b> (i.e. approved to be righteous,—according to the uniform Pauline usage: not as De W., al., ‘proved to be what he was.’ The Apostle is following the <i>historical order of events during the manifestation of our Lord on earth.</i> That this is so, is manifest by the final clause including the Ascension. I take these events then in their order, and refer this to our Lord’s baptism and temptation, in which His righteousness was approved and proved) <b>in the Spirit</b> (He was dwelt on by the Spirit in His baptism—led up by the Spirit to His great trial, and <i>in the Spirit,</i> His Spirit, that of which he said “the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak,” He was proved to be righteous and spotless and separate from evil and its agent. See Rom. i. 3, 4, where another proof of this His spiritual perfection is given, viz. the great and crowning one of the Resurrection from the dead. Some have thought of that proof here also: others, of the continued course of His miracles, <i>especially</i> the Resurrection: some of the Resurrec- tion and Ascension, by which He entered into His glory: others, in other ways. But I prefer keeping the historical order, though I would by no means limit the <i>justification</i> to that time only: <i>then</i> it was chiefly and prominently manifested), <b>was seen by angels</b> (viz. by means of His Incarnation, and specifically, when they came and ministered to Him after His temptation. This seems to be regarded as the first, or at all events is the first recorded occasion on which they ministered to Him.

The order and connexion of the clauses has been very variously understood, as may be seen in Wolf, and in De Wette. The triple antithesis, so characteristic of St. Paul, can hardly escape any reader: <i>“in the flesh, in the spirit,—angels, the nations,—in the world, in glory :”</i> but further it is hardly worth while to reproduce the distinctions which some have drawn, or motives for arrangement which they have supposed).<h2><u><b>CH.

Some have supposed the Apostle to refer to some prophetic passage of the Old Test., or to the general testimony of the Old Test. prophecies [Dan. vii. 25; viii. 23; xi. 30], or those of our Lord [Matt. xxiv. 4ff., 11], or of the Apostles [2 Thess. ii. 3 ff. 1 John ii. 18. 2 Pet. iii. 3.

But in the two former cases, we should hardly have had <b>the Spirit saith,</b> but the <i>Scripture, or the Lord,</i> or the like; the words imply rather the present agency of the Spirit: and the latter is only a less clear way of putting the explanation given above: for why should writings be referred to, when the living men were yet testifying in the power of the Spirit among them?

It does not appear here from what sort of food this abstinence would be enjoined: but probably the eating of flesh is alluded to.

The existence of gnosticism in its earlier form is certainly implied in ch. vi. 20: and in 2 Tim. ii. 17, 18, we find that denial of the resurrection which characterized all the varieties of subsequent gnosticism.

The emphasis is on this word, and a new particular is introduced by it—not purity merely, but <i>holiness</i>,—fitness for the godly usage of Christian men. To this, which is more than mere making or declaring pure, it is set apart by the <i>giving of thanks</i> ; so that the lesser is proved by the greater. There is certainly a slight trace of reference to the higher consecration in the Lord’s Supper. The same word <i>thanks- giving</i> is common to both. Ordinary meals are set apart for ordinary Christian use by asking a blessing on them: <i>that meal,</i> for more than ordinary use, by asking on it its own peculiar blessing) <b>by means of the word of God and intercession</b> (<i>what</i> ‘word of God ?’ how to be understood? Treating the plainer word first, the <i>intercession</i> meant is evidently intercession [see on ch, fi. 1] <i>on behalf of the thing partaken of</i>—that it may be ‘sanctified to our use.’ This may serve to guide us to the meaning of the <b>word of God.</b> And first, negatively. It cannot mean any thing which does not form part of the <i>thanksgiving:</i> such as God’s word in the Scripture just cited, or in any other place: or, God’s word in the foundation truths of Christianity. Then, positively: it must mean in some sense the <i>thanksgiving,</i> or something in it. But not the ‘word addressed to God,’ or ‘prayer made to God,’ which would be an unprecedented meaning for the <i>word of God:</i> the only way open for us is, that the <i>thanksgiving</i> itself, or some part of it, is in some sense <i>the word of God.</i> This may be (1) by its consisting in whole or in part of Scripture words, or (2) by the effusion of a Christian man, speaking in the power of God’s Spirit, being known as <i>the word of God.</i> This latter is perhaps justified : but still it seems to me hardly probable, and I should prefer the former. It would generally be the case, that any form of Christian thanksgiving before meat would contain words of Seripture, or at all events thoughts in exact accordance with them: and such utterance of God’s revealed will, bringing as it would the assembled family and their meal into harmony with Him, might well be said <i>to sanctify</i> the <i>meats</i> on the table for their use. Many of the Commentators quote from the (apocryphal but very ancient) Apostolic Constitution, the following grace before meat, used. in the primitive times: “ Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who nourishest me from my youth, who givest food to all flesh. Fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that always havingall competence, we may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord, through whom be unto Thee honour and might for ever.

The reference to an office was called in question as early as Chrysostom : “Does he mean the office ? I think not, but he is speaking of every oldman.” This indeed is evident from the quadruple specification in these verses: older men—elder women: younger men—younger women. <h3><u><b>the younger men</b>]</u></h3> Understand, <i>exhort.</i> Thus the prohibition, <b>rebuke not sharply,</b> applies to all, all being included in the command, <i>to exhort,</i> which is the other and adopted alternative. <b>as brethren</b>] as on an equality with them, not lording it over them. <h3><u><b>as sisters</b>]</u></h3> i.e. in all chastity. The rule of Jerome is simple: “All the young women and virgins of Christ do thou either equally avoid, or equally love.”<h2><u><b>3—16.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Directions concerning widows.</i> This whole passage is somewhat difficult, and has been very variously understood. The differences will be seen below.<h2><u><b>3. take into consideration</b>]</u></h2> literally, <b>honour:</b> but how? Is <i>“honour”</i> to be interpreted generally, <i>‘honour’</i> merely, or with reference to the context? The best guide to an answer will be what follows. If the command be merely to hold them in honour, why should the destitute be held in more honour than those who had families? The command to <i>honour</i> <i>widows</i> would surely apply to all alike. But seeing that it <i>does not</i> apply to all alike, we must necessarily limit its general meaning to that particular in which the one would be honoured, and the other not. Thus without giving or seeking for an unusual meaning to the word, we may fairly interpret it of this particular kind of honour, viz. being inscribed on the Church’s <i>list</i> or <i>roll</i> (ver. 9), as a-fit object of charitable sustenance. That such a roll existed in the very earliest days of the church, we know from Acts vi. 1: from Ignatius,<br><br>Justin Martyr, and Eusebius. <h3><u><b>that are widows indeed</b>]</u></h3> Compare <b>ver. 16 </b>below,<b>—those who are really in a widowed </b>(destitute) <b>state,</b> as contrasted with those described ver. 4. But then the enquiry has been made, Is this <i>being</i> a <i>widow indeed</i> to be defined by mere external circumstances, or not rather by the religious character, described below, ver. 5? Or are we to bind (as Chrysostom and others do) the two together? In a certain sense I believe we must thus unite them. The Apostle commands, ‘ Honour (by placing on the list) those who are widows indeed ;’ for it is these especially, they who are destitute of earthly friends, who are most likely to carry out the true religious duties of a widow. Thus, without the two qualifications being actually united, the former is insisted on as ordinarily ensuring the latter.<h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> The case of the<i> widow</i> who is not a <i>widow indeed,</i> having earthly relations answerable for her support.<h3><u><b>grandchildren</b>]</u></h3> not as A. V., ‘<i>nephews;</i>?’ at least, not in its present sense: at the time when our version was made, the word seems to have borne the meaning of <i>grandchildren</i>. <h3><u><b>let these learn</b>]</u></h3> What is <i>the subject?</i> Who are to learn? (1) The ancient Commentators mostly understand the <i>widows,</i> implied in the words <i>“if any widow”</i> above. (2) But some of the ancients took the <i>children</i> or <i>grandchildren</i> as the subject. <h3><u><b>first</b>]</u></h3> Either, <i>‘first of all duties,’</i> which seems supported by ver. 8 below; or <i>first,</i> before applying to the church for sustenance. These meanings will apply to both the above alternatives: whether we understand the subject to be the Widows, or the <i>children and grandchildren.</i> <h3><u><b>to shew piety to their own family</b>]</u></h3> On hypothesis <b>(1),</b><i>—to behave piously towards, i.e. to rule religiously</i> their own household. This seems somewhat to force the meaning of the verb, see below; while the sense of<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19UXq-sa0ZfPv1XWWiGePNRZjZONTpRhC/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 2, Part 1, Page 691:</a></h3><br><br><br>“<i>their own</i> household” is thus the simple and usual one, as the widow in question would be the head of the household: On hypothesis (2), <i>to behave piously towards, i.e. to honour with the honour which God commands,</i> their own family, i.e. the widowed mother or grandmother who is one of their own family. This sense of the verb is common enough: the reference being generally (not always, it is true) to superiors,—those who demand <i>reverence, </i>—those who stand in the place of God. This sense of <i>their own family or household</i> is not so usual, but not therefore to be rejected. To dishonour their widowed mother or grandmother, would be to dishonour their own family, in that one of its members who most required respect.<h3><u><b> and to requite their parents</b>]</u></h3> On hypothesis (1), as Chrysostom, “They (their parents) are dead and gone—thou canst not requite them: thou didst not beget them, nor yet bring them up. Requite it to them in their grandchildren: pay your debt through their posterity.” But surely it is a very strange way of requiting our progenitors for their care of us, to be kind towards our own children: and besides, what would this have to do with the question, whether or not the widow was to be put on the charity roll of the church? But on hypothesis (2) this sentence certainly becomes more clear and natural. Let them, the children or grandchildren, learn first to be piously grateful to (these members of) their own families, and to give back returns (a return in each case) to their progenitors (so called, although living, because, the <i>mother and grandmother</i> having been both mentioned, parents was the only word which would include them in one category).<h3><u><b>for this, &c.</b>]</u></h3> See ch. ii. 3.<h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2> See above on ver. 3. <br><br><b>she that is a widow indeed</b>, as opposed to the widow just described; <b>and desolate,</b> as contrasting her condition with that of her who has children or grandchildren. Thus what follows is said more for moral eulogy of such a widow, than as commending her to the charity of the Church: but at the same time, as pointing out that one who thus places her hopes and spends her time, is best deserving of the Church’s help.<h3><u><b>hath set</b>]</u></h3> The word implies, ‘ and continues to set,’ <b>her hope.</b> <br><br><b>toward God,</b> as its portion and ultimate aim,—as distinguished from “<i>on God,</i>” ch. iv. 10, on God as its present stay. <br><br><b>her</b> (or, the) <b>supplications and her</b> (or, the) <b>prayers</b> (i.e. either her own, private, or the public prayers of the Church).<h3><u><b>night and day</b>]</u></h3> So St. Luke of Anna the prophetess, ii. 37.<h2><u><b>6.</b>]</u></h2> Contrast to the character just described : and that certainly with a view to point out that this kind of widow is no object for the charity of the Church, as not being at all a partaker of the life unto God.<h3><u><b>is given to dissipation</b>]</u></h3> The Greek word which I have thus rendered signifies to live riotously or retchlessly. <h3><u><b>is dead while she liveth</b>]</u></h3> while alive in the flesh, has no real life in the Spirit: see ref.—and Matt. viii. 22: Eph. v.14, I cannot help regarding the idea as in the background,—‘and, if devoid of spiritual life, then not to be taken into account by the Church.’<h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> <b>these things</b> most naturally applies to the characters just given of widows, not more generally: and in that case the words <i>“ that they may be irreproachable”</i> must refer to the widows also, not to the <i>children</i> and <i>grandchildren</i>, or to these and the widows together, or more widely still. This narrower reference is confirmed by the next verse, which takes up the duty of the relations, being connected not by “<i>for,</i>” but by “<i>but.</i>” <h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> <b>any,</b> not only of the <i>children</i> or <i>grandchildren</i> above, or any persons connected with widows,<b>—but </b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15WYOgqFFk1u7pdhoBYWQaIpwb7suOmrV/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Where therefore love is not nor works, there is not, nor works, faith either: so that he who fulfils not the offices of love towards his relatives, is virtually an unbeliever.” <h3><u><b>worse than an unbeliever</b>]</u></h3> For even among heathens the common duties of family piety are recognized : if therefore a Christian repudiates them, he lowers himself beneath the heathen. Compare Matt. v. 46, 47. Also, as Calvin suggests in addition, the Christian who lives in the light of the Gospel, has less excuse for breaking those laws of nature which even without the Gospel are recognized by men.—According to hypothesis (1) or (2) above, this general statement applies to the widows or to their children and grandchildren. But surely it would be very harsh to understand it of the widows: and this forms an additional argument for hypothesis (2).<h2><u><b>9—16.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Further regulations respecting widows.</i><h2><u><i><b> </b></i><b>9.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Let a woman be inserted in the catalogue as a widow.</b> But now, for what purpose? What <i>catalogue</i> are we to understand? Hardly, (1) that of those who are to receive relief from the Church (so Chrysostom and many others) : for thus the rule, that she is to he <i>sixty years of age,</i> would seem a harsh one, as many widows might be destitute at a far earlier age: as also the rule that she must. not have been <i>twice married,</i> especially as the Apostle himself below commands second. marriage for the younger widows. Again, the duties enjoined in ver. 10 presuppose some degree of competence, and thus, on this hypothesis, the widows of the poorer classes would be excluded from sustenance by charity,—who most of all others would require it. Also, for the reason alleged in ver. 11, <i>sustenance</i> can hardly be in question —for then the re-marrying would simply take them off the roll, and thus be rather a benefit, than a detriment to the Church. Nor again (2) can we understand the roll to be that of the <i>deaconesses,</i> as some do: although the Theodosian code, founded on this interpretation, ordained “that none should be taken into the number of the deaconesses under sixty years old, according to the precept of the Apostle.” For, a) the age mentioned is unfit for the work of the deaconesses’ office, and in the council of Chalcedon the age of the deaconesses was fixed at forty: b) not only widows but virgins were elected deaconesses: (3) it is implied in ver. 12, that these widows were bound not to marry again, which was not the ease with the deaconesses. It seems therefore better to understand here <i>some especial band of widows,</i> sustained perhaps at the expense of the church, but not the only ones who were thus supported :— set apart for ecclesiastical duties, and bound to the service of God. Such are understood here by Chrysostom himself in his homily on the passage. They are also mentioned as <i>the band of widows, as presbytresses, as having precedence of rank:</i> i.e. such widows as corresponded in office for their own sex in some measure to the presbyters,—sat unveiled in the assemblies in a separate place, by the presbyters, and had a kind of supervision over their own sex, especially over the widows and orphans: were vowed to perpetual widowhood, clad with ‘widow’s vestments,’ and ordained by laying on of hands. This institution of the early church, which was abolished by the eleventh canon of the council of Laodicea, is sufficiently affirmed by many of the Fathers. De Wette makes the allusion to this ‘institute of widows’ one proof of the post-apostolic date of the Epistle: but on this see Introd. ch, vi. § i.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13mmFSnJgrfvaoouwETH7eCFEOJbi7lIs/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It is, for example, the going into a prison and visiting the prisoners, the visiting the sick, the comforting the distressed, the soothing those who are in pain, the contributing in every way all that is possible, and declining nothing that may tend to the well-being and refreshment of them that are our brethren.” Bengel’s idea, “ that it is the part of those in high station, and of <i>men,</i> to <i>set the example</i> of good works, and of women, to follow, in helping on as much as they can,” is ingenious but wrong.

Grotius conceives an allusion to the double portion of the firstborn [Deut. xxi. 17]; Elsner, to the double share of provision which used to be set before the presbyters in the Agapæ. But as De Wette remarks, that practice was much more probably owing to a misunder- standing of this passage), <b>especially those that labour in (the) word and teaching</b> (therefore the preaching of the word, and teaching, was <i>not the office of all the presbyters.</i> Conybeare rightly remarks, that this is a proof of the early date of the Epistle.

Some have referred them to Lev. xix. 13: Deut. xxiv. 14, which passages however say nothing of the kind, being special directions about paying a labourer’s wages before night. Theodoret and Theophylact suppose it to be quoted from the New Testament; i.e. from our Lord’s saying, Matt. x. 10: Luke x. 7. But it is very unlikely that the Apostle should cite these under the title of the <i>Scripture:</i> and Calvin’s view seems most probable, that “the Scripture saith” refers only to the former citation, and that he adduces this sentiment, as our Lord Himself does, as a popular and well-known saying.—This verse it is, which makes it extremely probable, that<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YxZElMGWpmPuVk-vLbWPX_ghzlLO1SyY/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Three answers are given: one, that accuracy in the number of the witnesses was to be strictly insisted on because false informations were prevalent: another, and so Calvin more at length: that Timothy was not constituted judge in private men’s matters, only over the officers of the church in faults with which they might be charged as regarded the execution of their duty: a third, that a private man might by the law of Moses be cited with one witness only, not condemned; but that St. Paul prohibits the <i>citing</i> even of a presbyter without two or three. But this is manifestly a distinction without point—the <i>receiving</i> <i>an accusation</i> being used not of mere citation, but of entertaining the charge as a valid one: in other words, as including citation and conviction as well.

The reference is primarily to presbyters: of course extending also in its spirit to all other church offices. This reference, which is maintained by most Commentators, is denied by some others, who understand the command to refer to receiving back into the church excommunicated persons, or heretics, which from later testimonies they shew to have been the practice: Huther, rightly rejecting this idea, yet interprets it of laying on of hands as merely conveying ecclesiastical blessing on many various occasions. But surely this is too vague and unimportant for the solemn language here used. Regarding the whole, to ver. 25, as connected, and belonging to one subject, I cannot accept any interpretation but the obvious and ordinary one: see especially ch. iv. 14: 2 Tim. i. 6.— <b>Lay hands hastily on no one, nor be par- taker in other men’s sins </b>(as he would do by being the means of negligently admitting into the ministry unfit and ungodly persons, being properly held responsible for the consequence of those bad habits of theirs which more care might have ascertained. The word <i>sin</i> points to the former expression, <i>“them that sin</i>”):<b>—Keep THYSELF</b> (highly emphatic: not merely others over whom thou art called to preside and pronounce judgment in admitting them to the ministry. And the emphasis is peculiarly in place here, as applying to that which has just preceded. If he were to admit improper candidates to the ministry from bias or from negligence, his own character, by his becoming a partaker in their sins, would suffer: whatever thou doest therefore, be sure to maintain, by watchful care and caution, <i>thyself</i> above all stain of blame) pure (not here to be referred to personal purity and chastity, though that of course would be the most important of all elements in carrying out the precept: but as above).<b>—No longer</b> (habitually) drink water, but use a little wine, on account of thy stomach, and thy frequent illnesses (the question, why this injunction is here inserted, has never been satisfactorily answered. Many take it as a modification of <i>“keep thyself pure,”</i> so as to prevent it from being misunderstood as enjoining asceticism. But on our explanation of the words, and I may add on any worthy view of the context, such a connexion will at once be repudiated. Chrysostom has caught the right clue, when he says, “Timothy seems to me to have been generally an invalid: and this the Apostle shews when he says, &c. as here:” but he has not followed it up. Timothy was certainly of a feeble bodily frame, and this feebleness appears, from other hints which we have respecting him, to have affected his character. See especially 1 Cor. xvi. 10, 11, and note there. Is it not very possible, that such feebleness, and perhaps timidity, may have influenced him as an overseer of the church, and prevented that keen-sighted judgment and vigorous action which a bishop should ever shew in estimating the characters of those who are candidates for the ministry? If this was so, then it is quite natural that in advising him on this point, St. Paul should throw in a hint, in fatherly kindness, that he must not allow these maladies to interfere with the efficient discharge of his high office, but take all reasonable means of raising his bodily condition above them. I feel compelled to adopt this view, from the close connexion of the next verse with the whole preceding passage, and the exceedingly unnatural isolation of this, unless it bears such a reference).<h2><u><b>24.</b>]</u></h2> <i>The same subject continued. </i>If my view of the last verse is correct, the connexion will be found in the fact, that the conservation of himself in health and vigour would ensure his being able to deal ably and firmly with the cases which should come before him for decision.

The other arrangement, which is that of A. V., <i>‘as many bondmen as are under the yoke,’</i> making under the yoke emphatic as distinguishing either 1) those <i>treated hardly, </i>or 2) those who were <i>under unbelieving masters,</i> has undoubtedly something to be said for it, but does not seem to me so likely, from the arrangement of the words. I take then <i>“bondmen under the yoke”</i> as the predicate) <b>hold their own </b>(<i>“their own,”</i> as in Eph. v. 22, and many other places, to bring out and emphasize the relation; see note there) <b>masters worthy of all </b>(fitting)<b> honour, that the name of God and his doctrine </b>(compare Tit. ii. 10, where, writing on the same subject, he admonishes slaves, “that they adorn the doctrine of our Saviour, even God, in all things”) <b>be not spoken evil of</b> (Chrysostom gives the sense well: “The unbeliever, if he see his slaves conducting themselves insolently because they are Christians, will generally revile the doctrine of Christ as causing insubordination : but when he sees them subordinate, he will be more likely to be persuaded, and will give more attention to what is said” [by those who preach Christ]. This verse obviously applies only to those slaves who had unbelieving masters. This is brought out by the reason given, and by the contrast in the next verse, not by any formal opposition in terms. The account to be given of the absence of such opposition is, that this verse contains the general exhortation, the ease of Christian slaves under <i>unbelieving</i> masters being by far the more common. The <i>exception</i> is treated in the next verse).<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ME3mWJZww9RPHDpFl64jIi7kaM94WmKP/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Some regard it as the com- mandment above, ver. 14: some as meaning the grace given to him for his office, or for his own spiritual life: but ch. i. 18, compared with 2 Tim. ii. 2, seems ‘to fix the meaning as above) <b>turning away from</b> (compare 2 Tim. iii. 5) <b>the profane babblings</b> (empty discourses: so also 2 Tim. ii. 16) <b>and oppositions</b> (apparently, dialectic antitheses and niceties of the false teachers) <b>of that which is falsely named</b> (“for without being <i>faith</i>, it cannot be <i>knowledge</i>.” Chrysostom) <b>knowledge</b> (the true <i>Gnosis</i> [knowledge], being one of the greatest gifts of the Spirit to the Church, was soon counterfeited by various systems of hybrid theology, calling themselves by this honoured name. In the Apostle’s time, the misnomer was already current: but we are not therefore justified in assuming that it had received'so definite an application, as afterwards it did to the various forms of Gnostic heresy. All that we can hence gather is, that the true spiritual <i>Gnosis</i> of the Christian was already being counterfeited by persons bearing the characteristics noticed in this Epistle. Whether these were the Gnostics themselves, or their precursors, we have examined in the Introduction to the Pastoral Epistles):<h2><u><b>21</b>.]</u></h2> <b>which</b> (the <i>falsely called knowledge</i>) <b>some professing</b> (ch. ii. 10) <b>missed the mark</b> (the word is used of one shooting and missing.

V.a subscription to the Epistle is found, “The first to Timothy was written from Laodicea, is the chiefest city of Phrygia Pacatiana.” A shorter notice, “from Laodicea,” is found in the Alexandrine MS. These owe their origin probably to the notion that this was the Epistle from Laodicea mentioned Col. iv. 16. The further addition in the A. V. betrays a date subsequent to the fourth century, when the province of Phrygia Pacatiana was first created.<br><h1>Book: 2 Timothy</h1><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/194AFL0aNsKbA09VQ3b5vL437eU8SLzyq/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

To find in the word “<i>beloved</i>” <i>more</i> confidence, as some do, can hardly be correct: the expression of feeling is <i>different</i> in kind, not comparable in degree: suiting an Epistle of warm affection and somewhat saddened reminding, rather than one of rising hope and confidence. I regret to be, on this point, at issue throughout this second Epistle, with my friend Bishop Ellicott, who seems to me too anxious to rescue the character of Timothy from the slightest imputation of weakness: thereby marring the delicate texture of many of St. Paul’s characteristic periods, in which tender reproof, vigorous reassurance, and fervent affection are exquisitely intermingled.<h2><u><b>3—5.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Thankful declaration of love and anxiety to see him.</i> <b>I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my ancestors </b>(from my immediate progenitors: not, from my remote ancestors, Abraham, &c, The reason for the profession may perhaps<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWkB_6EcrdmS5fNQ_iXSEIyDVyeW0-b_/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Any apparent discrepancy with that passage, from the Apostle here speaking of the laying on of <i>his own hands alone</i>, may be removed by regarding the Apostle as chief in the ordination, and the presbytery as his assistants, as is the case with Bishops at the present day. As to the attributing the gift to the <i>laying on of hands</i> as its agent, we can only appeal, against the Roman-Catholic expositors, to the whole spirit of St. Paul's teaching, as declaring that by such an expression he does not mean that the inward spiritual grace is operated merely and barely by the outward visible sign,—but is only asserting, in a mode of speech common to us all, that the solemn dedication by him of Timothy to God’s work, of which the laying on of his hands was the sign and seal, did bring with it gifts and grace for that work. In this sense, and in this alone, the gift came through <i>the laying on of hands</i>, that laying on being the concentrated and effective sign of the setting apart, and conveying in faith the answer, assumed by faith, to the prayers of the church. That the Apostle had <i>authority</i> thus to set apart, was necessary to the validity of the act, and thus to the reception of the grace:—but the authority did not <i>convey</i> the grace. I may just add that the ‘indelibility of orders” which Mack infers from this passage, is simply and directly refuted by it. If the <i>gift</i> <i>which was in him</i> required <i>stirring up</i>, if, as Chrysostom says, ‘it is in us to quench it, and to re-light it,’—then plainly it is not indelible). <h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> <b>For</b> (‘and there is reason for my thus exhorting thee, seeing that thou hast shewn a spirit inconsistent with the character of that <i>gift</i>.’ The particle is passed over by Ellicott) <b>God did not give</b> (when we were admitted to the ministry: not, ‘<i>hath not given</i>,’ as A. V., which loses the reference) us the spirit (not “<i>a spirit</i>:” see my Greek Test.) of cowardice (there is doubtless a touch of severity in the use of this word, putting before Timothy his timidity in such a light as to shame him); <b>but</b> (the spirit) <b>of power</b> (as opposed to the weakness implicd in cowardice), <b>and love</b> (as opposed to that false compliance with men, which shrinks from bold rebuke :—that lofty self-abandonment of love for others, which will even sacrifice repute, and security, and all that belongs to self, in the noble struggle to do men good), <b>and correction </b>(the original meaning of the word ‘admonition of others that they may become <b>sound-minded</b>,— must be retained, as necessary both on ac- count of usage, and on account of the context. It is this bearing bold testimony before others, from which Timothy appears to have shrunk: compare ver. 8. The word in after times became a common one for <i>discipline</i> or <i>ecclesiastical correction</i>. The making the word mean <i>a sound mind</i>, as A. V. and many Commentators, is surely not allowable, though Chrysostom puts it doubtfully as an alternative. The only way in which it can come virtually to that, is by supposing the <i>correction</i> to be exercised <i>by ourselves over ourselves</i>.

It is impossible to deny that the above personal reference does enter again and but I cannot believe it to be more than secondary.

So Theodoret: (f) <i>the faith and its proclamation to the world</i>. So Chrysostom, as an alternative: (g) the <i>apostolic office </i>which the Apostle regarded as a thing entrusted to him, a stewardship, 1 Cor. ix. V7 (h) the <i>faithful</i> who had been converted by him in the view of their having been <i>committed to him by Christ</i>: (i) his <i>own soul</i>, as entrusted to him by God. On all these, and this view of the <i>deposit</i> generally, I may remark that we may fairly be guided by the same words “<i>the trust which was committed to thee, keep</i>” in ver. 14 as to their sense here. As, in ver. 14, these words are said of the subject of the sentence, viz. Timothy, keeping a deposit entrusted to him,—so here they must he said of the subject of the sentence, viz. God, keeping a deposit entrusted to Him. Otherwise, while keeping the mere word <b>deposit</b> to the same formal meaning in both places, we shall, most harshly and unnaturally, be requiring the phrase to bear, in two almost consecutive verses, two totally different meanings. The analogy therefore of ver. 14, makes the second group of meanings entirely against it, and in fact necessitates the adoption of the first alternative, viz. the objective genitive,—and the <i>deposit committed by the Apostle to God</i>. And when we enquire what this deposit was, we have the reply, I conceive, in the previous words <b>whom I have trusted</b>. He had entrusted HIMSELF, body, soul, and spirit, to the keeping of his heavenly Father, and lay safe in his hands, confident of His abiding and effectual care. A strong confirmation of this view is gained from 1 Thess. v. 23. In an English <i>version</i>, it is necessary to adopt one or other of the alternatives, for the sake of perspicuity. I have therefore retained the words of the A. V.) <b>against</b> (in a temporal sense: not simply <i>‘until’</i>) <b>that day</b> (viz. the day of Christ’s appearing ; see especially ch. iv. 8). <h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> The utmost care is required, in interpreting this verse, to ascertain the probable meaning of the words in reference to the context. On the right appreciation of this depends the question whether they are to be taken in their strict meaning, and simple grammatical sense, or to be forced to some possible but far-fetched rendering. The consideration depends very much on the collocation and meaning of the words in the original, and can hardly be represented to the English reader. I have argued in my Greek Testament that the ordinary rendering as in A. V., “<i>Hold fast the form of sound words</i>,” is absolutely untenable. The verb does not mean “<i>hold fast</i>,’ but is simply “<b>have</b>,” or “<b>take</b>,” and it is not “<i>the</i> form,” but ‘<b>a form</b>,” or “<b>a sample</b>.” This being so, we shall have the rendering so far,—<b>Have</b> (take) <b>an example of</b> (the) <b>sound words, which thou heardest of me in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</b> Then two questions arise for us: to what (1) does <b>take an example</b> refer? I answer,—to the saying immediately preceding, “<i>I know whom I have trusted</i>,” <i>&c</i>. This was one of those<i> faithful </i>or<i> wholesome sayings</i>, of which we hear so often in these Epistles; one which in his timidity, Timothy was perhaps in danger of forgetting, and of which therefore the Apostle reminds him, and bids him take it as a specimen or pattern of those sound words which had been committed to him by his father in the faith. To what (2) do the words <b>in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus</b> refer? Certainly not to the words “<i>from me</i>,” meaning “those sound words which I spake to thee concerning, versed in, faith and love,” &c.: not, again, to the command “<i>here</i>,” or “<i>take</i>,” to which in our understanding of it, such a qualification would be altogether inapplicable: but to <b>thou heardest</b>, reminding Timothy of the readiness of belief, and warmth of affection, with which he had at first received the wholesome words from the mouth of the Apostle, and thus tacitly reproaching him for his present want of growth in that faith and love; as if it had been said, Let me in thus speaking, ‘I know whom I have believed, &c.,’ call to thy mind, by one example, those faithful sayings, those words<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzY6v9QFk7hL4CkgKLowAS87Jdf83sZQ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

He proceeds to speak of a few of the discouragements under which in this confidence he was bearing up: and, affectionate gratitude prompting him, and at the same time hy way of an example of fidelity to Timothy, he dilates on the exception to the general dereliction of him which had been furnished by Onesiphorus.—<b>Thou knowest this, that all who are in Asia </b>(it does not follow, as Chrysostom says, that “it was probable that there were then present in Rome many from divers parts of Asia:” but he uses the expression with reference to him to whom he was writing, who was in the proconsular Asia) <b>turned away from me</b> (not as A. V., ‘are turned away from me’ [perfect]: the act referred to took place at a stated time, and from what follows, that time appears to have been on occasion of a visit to Rome. They were ashamed of Paul the prisoner, and did not seek him out, see ch. iv. 16: “they avoided the society of the Apostle from fear of Nero,” Theodoret : but perhaps not so much from this motive, as from the one hinted at in the praise of Onesiphorus below. The <b>all</b> must of course apply to all of whom the Apostle <i>had had trial</i> [and not even those without exception, vv. 16—18]: the A. V. gives the idea, that a general apostasy of all in Asia from St. Paul had taken place. On Asia, i.e. the proconsular Asia, see note, Acts xvi. 6); <b>of whom are</b> (this is hardly to be pressed as indicating that at the present moment Phygelus and Hermogenes were in Rome and were shunning him: it merely includes them in the class just mentioned) <b>Phygelus and Hermogenes</b> (why their names are specially brought forward, does not appear.

Some indeed take it as merely an extension of the gratitude of the Apostle from Onesiphorus to his household: but ch. iv. 19 is against this. ‘Theodoret indeed and Chrysostom understand that Onesiphorus was <i>with him </i>at this time: but the words here [e. g., <i>when he came to Rome</i>] will hardly allow that), <b>because on many occasions he refreshed me</b> (any kind of refreshing, of body or mind, may be implied), <b>and was not ashamed of</b> (ver. 8) <b>my chain </b>(my condition of a prisoner): <b>but when he came to Rome, sought me out the more diligently</b> (he did not shrink<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oX3_ZqSsDOZR1hUbqfskBgrzdCy0UIHt/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But he forgets that these two methods of teaching are in fact but one and the same. <i>Scripture</i> has been <i>God’s way of fixing tradition</i>, and rendering it trustworthy at any distance of time; of obviating the very danger which in this Epistle we see so imminent, viz. of one of those teachers, who were links in this chain of transmission, becoming inefficient and transmitting it inadequately. This very Epistle is therefore a warning to us not to trust oral tradition, seeing that it was so dependent on men, and to accept no way of conserving it but that which God’s providence has pointed out to us in the canonical books of Scripture.<h2><u><b>3</b>.]</u></h2> <b>Suffer hardship with me</b> (“<i>me</i>” is not expressed in the Greek. The word signifies, as Conybeare happily renders it, «Take thy <i>share</i> in suffering.’ The mention of the share binds it to what pre- cedes and follows, referring primarily to the Apostle himself, though doubtless having a wider reference to all who similarly suffer: see above, on the connexion of ver. 2) <b>as a good soldier of Jesus Christ</b>. <h2><u>4.]</u></h2> <b>No soldier when on service is </b>(suffers himself to be: ‘is,’ as his normal state) <b>entangled in the businesses of life; that he may please him who called him to be a soldier </b>(who originally enrolled him as a soldier: the word signifies <i>to levy soldiers</i>, or <i>raise a troop</i>, and “<i>he who chose him to be a soldier</i>,” designates the commander of such troop.—The taking of these precepts according to the letter, to signify that no minister of Christ may have a secular occupation, is quite beside the purpose: for 1) it is not ministers, but all soldiers of Christ who are spoken of : 2) the position of the verb shews that it is not the fact of the <i>existence</i> of such occupation, but the being <i>entangled</i> in it, which is before the Apostle’s mind: 3) the Apostle’s own example sufficiently confutes such an idea. Only then does it become unlawful, when such occupation, from its engrossing the man, becomes a hindrance to the work of the ministry,—or from its nature is incompatible with it).<h2><u><b>5</b>.]</u></h2> The soldier must serve on condition of not dividing his service: now we have another instance of the same requirement: and in the conflicts of the arena there are certain laws, without the fulfilment of which no man can obtain the victory. <b>But</b> (the above is not the only example, but) <b>if any one also </b>(i.e. to give another instance) <b>strive in the games</b> (it is necessary to adopt a circumlocution for the verb used, “<i>be an athlete</i>.’ That of A.V., ‘<i>strive for masteries</i>, is not definite enough, omitting all mention of the games, and by consequence not even suggesting them to the ordinary reader), <b>he is not crowned</b> (even in case of his gain- ing the victory? or is the word inclusive of all efforts made to get the crown,—‘he has no chance of the crown?’ rather the former), <b>unless he have striven</b> (this seems to assume the getting of the vic-<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kQPHH551xmdpKghyZ_Ws7Wv1OPOxcICj/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The Incarnation and Resurrection of Christ were two truths especially imperiled, and indeed denied, by their teaching. At the same time these very<br><br>truths, believed and persisted in, furnished him with the best grounds for steadfastness in his testimony to the Gospel, and attachment to the Apostle himself, suffering for his faithfulness to them: and on his adherence to these truths depended his share in that Saviour in whom they were manifested, and in union with whom, in His eternal and unchangeable truth, our share in blessedness depends. <b>Keep in remembrance Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David</b> (the abrupt, and otherwise unaccountable sequence of these clauses, has been supposed to spring from their being parts of a recognized and technical profession of faith), <b>according to my Gospel</b> (‘the Gospel entrusted to me to teach.

But neither 1) is this sound logic, nor 2)is it in accordance with the Apostle’s usage of the expression “<i>for this cause that</i>.” 1) The fact, that the word of God is not bound, is clearly not the reason why he suffers these things for the elect: nor can we say with Huther, that the <i>consciousness</i> of this fact is that in which he endures all. De Wette takes the predominant idea to be, the dispersion and success of God’s word, in and by which the Apostle is encouraged to suffer. But this would render the connexion very loose. 2) In 1 Tim. i. 16, and Philem. 15, the reference of “<i>for this cause</i>” is evidently to <i>what follows</i>: compare also Rom. iv. 16, 2 Cor. xiii. 10. I would therefore refer the words to the following, and consider them, as in the above instances, as a marked way of indicating the reason presently to be given: ‘for this purpose, ... that;’ so Chrysostom and others) <b>I endure all things</b> (not merely suffer [objective]: but readiness and persistence [subjective] are implied in the word, and the universal <i>all things</i> belongs to this subjective meaning—‘ I am enduring, ready to bear, all things’) <b>for the sake of the elect </b>(see especially Tit. i. 1. The Apostle does not refer merely to those elect of God who are not yet converted, but generally to the whole category, both those who are already turned to him, and those who are yet to be turned: compare the parallel declaration in Col. i. 24), <b>that they also</b> (as well as ourselves with reference to what is to follow, the certainty that we, who suffer with Him, shall reign with Him) <b>may obtain the salvation which is in </b>(as its element and condition of ex- istence) <b>Christ Jesus with eternal glory</b> (salvation here, in its spiritual presence and power—“<i>by grace ye have been saved</i>,” Eph. ii. 6: and glory hereafter, the full development and expansion of salvation, Rom. viii. 21). <b>Faithful is the saying</b> (another of those current Christian sayings, probably the utterances originally of the Spirit by those who spoke <i>prophecies</i> in the Church—and, as in 1 Tim. iii. 16, bearing with it so much of balance and rhythmical arrangement, as to seem to be a portion of some hymn): <b>For</b> (Chrysostom and others regard this <b>for</b> as rendering a reason why the <i>saying is faithful</i>, understanding <i>faithful is the saying</i> of what has <i>gone before</i>, viz. the certainty that <i>he who obtains salvation shall also win eternal glory</i>. But this is most unnatural. The <b>for</b> is not merely explicative, but as in 1 Tim. iv. 9, renders a reason for the assertion that the <i>saying is faithful</i>,—in the declaration of the fact in well-known words: for the fact is so, that if &c.) <b>if we died with Him</b> (pointing to <i>some one definite event</i>: the reference must be to that participation in Christ’s death which takes place <i>at baptism </i>in all those who are His, and which those who follow Him in sufferings emphatically shew that they then did really take on them: see Rom. vi. 3, 4,8: Col. ii. 12, Certainly if the past tense stood alone, it might be taken as <i>anticipatory</i>, looking back on life from that future day in which the <i>living with</i> <i>him</i> will be realized : but coupled as it is with the <i>present</i>, “<i>we endure</i>,” and the future, “<i>we shall deny</i>,” we can hardly take it otherwise than literally as to time, of an event already past, and if so, strictly as in the parallel Rom. vi. 8, where the reference is clear), <b>we shall also live with Him</b> (hereafter in glory): <b>if we endure </b>(with Him: see Rom. viii. 17), <b>we shall also reign with Him </b>(sce Rom. vy. 17; viii. 17.

In this place, these last days are set before Timothy as being on their way, and indeed their premonitory symptoms already appearing.

De Wette remarks, “ This is an admirable characterization of zealous soul-hunters (who have been principally found, and are still found, among the Roman Catholics) and their victims. We must not however divide the different traits among different classes or individuals: it is their combination only which is characteristic.’” “One would say,” says Calvin, “that Paul was here designedly painting the portraiture of the life of the cloister”).<h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> <b>But</b> (i.e. it is no wonder that there should be now such opponents to the truth, for their prototypes existed also in ancient times) <b>as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses</b> (these are believed to be traditional names of the Egyptian magicians mentioned in Exod. vii. 11, 22. Origen says, “That which we read in St. Paul, ‘Jannes and Mambres withstood Moses,’ is not found in the public Scriptures, but in a secret book inscribed ‘ Jannes and Mambres,’ but Theodoret’s account is more probable, that St. Paul learnt their names, not out of the Holy Scriptures, but from the unwritten teaching of the Jews,” especially as the names are found in the Targum of Jonathan on Exod. vii. 11; xxii. 22. The traditional history of Jannes and Jambres, collected out of the rabbinical books, is as follows: They were the sons of Balaam— prophesied to Pharaoh the birth of Moses, in consequence of which he gave the order for the destruction of the Jewish children, —and thenceforward appear as the counsellors of much of the evil,—in Egypt, and in the desert, after the Exodus,—which happened to Israel.

Whereas the <i>perfect</i>, as in A. V., would imply that the example had been really ever before him, and followed up to the present moment: and so would weaken the necessity of the exhortation) <b>my teaching, conduct, purpose</b> (Ellicott remarks, that in all other passages in St. Paul’s Epistles, this word <b>purpose</b> is used with reference to God),<b> faith, longsuffering</b> (“his bearing with the offences of the brethren,” Theodoret: or perhaps, as Chrysostom,—“his patience in respect of the false teachers and the troubles of the time”), <b>love</b> (“which they had not,” Chrysostom), <b>endurance</b> (or patience: “how generously I bear the attacks of my enemies,” 'heodoret), <b>persecutions</b> (“to these <i>endurance</i> furnished the note of transition,” Huther), <b>sufferings</b> (not only was I persecuted, but the persecution issued in infliction of suffering), <b>such</b> (suf- ferings) <b>as befell mein Antioch (of Pisidia), in Iconium, in Lystra</b> (why should these be especially enumerated? Theodoret as- signs as a reason, “ Omitting mention of other dangers, he speaks only of those which happened to him in Pisidia and Lycaonia. For he to whom he was writing was a Lycaonian, and these incidents were better known to him than the rest.” And so Chrysostom, and many both ancient and modern, It may be so, doubtless: and this reason, though rejected by De Wette and others, seems much better to suit the context and probability, than the other, given by Huther, that these persecutions were the first which befell the Apostle in his missionary work among the heathen. It is objected to it, that during the former of these persecutions Timothy was not with St. Paul. But the answer to that is easy. At the time of his conversion, they were recent, and the talk of the churches in those parts: and thus, especially with our rendering, and the indefinite past sense of “<i>thou followedst</i>,” would be naturally mentioned, as being those sufferings of the Apostle which first excited the young convert’s attention to make them his own pattern of what he too must suffer for the Gospel’s sake. Baur and De Wette regard the <i>exact correspondence</i> with the Acts (xiii. 50; xiv. 5, 19; xvi. 3] as a suspicious cir- cumstance. Wiesinger well asks, would they have regarded a <i>discrepancy</i> from the Acts as a mark of genuineness?); <b>what persecutions</b> (or, <b>such persecutions as</b>:— understand, ‘thou sawest ; in proposing to thyself a pattern thou hadst before thee . . 7) <b>I underwent: and out of all the Lord</b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14TLxfMornCrA4CnVEU8zHfmd012W9xT3/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

There is considerable doubt about the construction of the first clause in this verse, the grounds of which it is hardly possible to bring before an English reader. Is it to be taken, (1) <b>every scripture</b> (subject) (is) <b>inspired by God</b> (predicate), <b>and profitable</b>: or (2) <b>every scripture inspired by God</b> (subject) <b>is also profitable</b> (predicate)? The former is followed by Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, Athanasius, Estius, Calvin, &e.,and by the A.V. The latter by Origen, Theodoret, by Grotius, Erasmus, &c., and the ancient Syriac version, the Latin Vulgate, and Luther. In deciding between these two, the following considerations must be weighed by the English reader, exclusive of those which require a knowledge of the arrangement and requirement of the Greek : (a) the requirement of the context.

It is then very possible,that the Apostle might, wish to exalt the dignity of the Scripture by asserting of it that it was <i>inspired by God</i>, and then out of this lofty predicate might unfold that it <i>was also profitable</i>, &c. ;—its various uses in the spiritual life. On the other hand it may be urged, that, thus the two epithets do not hang naturally together, the first consisting of the one word <i>God-inspired</i>, and the other being expanded into a whole sentence: especially as in order at all to give symmetry to the whole, the end stated in ver. 17 must be understood as the purposed result of the <i>inspiration</i> as well as of the <i>profit</i> of the Scriptures, which is hardly natural: (b) the requirements of the grammatical construction: see in my Greek Test.—I own on the whole the balance seems to me to incline on the side of (2), unobjectionable as it is in construction, and of the two, better suited to the context. I therefore follow it, hesitatingly, I confess, but feeling that: it is not to be lightly overthrown. <b>Every Scripture</b> (not ‘every writing :’ the word never occurs in the New Test. except in the sense of ‘Scripture.’ It may mean, perhaps, all Scripture: but, in the presence of such an expression as “another Scripture saith,” John xix. 37, it is safer to keep to the meaning, unobjectionable both gram- matically and contextually, ‘every Scripture’—i. e, ‘every part of Scripture’) <b>given by inspiration of God</b> (this word <i>inspired</i>, like that in the Greek, is an expression and idea connected with <i>breath</i>, the power of the divine Spirit being conceived of as a breath of life: the word thus amounts to ‘breathed through,’ ‘full of the Spirit” It (the idea) is common to Jews, Greeks, and Romans. Josephus speaks of the prophets as having learnt according to the <i>afflatus</i> (breathing into them) from God. Plato and Plutarch speak of <i>inspired wisdom and inspired dreams</i>; Cicero says, “No one ever was a great man without some divine afflatus.” “Inspired” is first found as a predicate of persons: compare Matt. xxii. 43; 2 Pet. i, 21: then it was also applied to things. On the meaning of the word as applied to the Scriptures, see Introd. to Vol. I. ‘On the inspiration of the Gospels.’ As applied to the prophets, the sense would not materially differ, except “that we ever regard one speaking <i>prophecy</i>, strictly so called, as more immediately and thoroughly the mouthpiece of the Holy Spirit, seeing that the future is wholly hidden from men, aud God does not in this case use or inspire <i>human testimony to facts</i>, but suggests <i>the whole substance </i>of what is said, <i>direct</i> from Himself) <b>is also</b> (besides this its quality of inspiration : on the construction, see above)<b> profitable for</b> (towards) <b>teaching</b> (this, the <i>teaching of the person</i> reading the Scriptures, not the <i>making him a teacher</i>, is evidently the meaning.

For fountains flow, even if no one draw from them: and rivers run, though no one drinks. So too the preacher ought, even if no one attend to him, to fulfil all his own duty; for our rule, who have taken in hand the ministry of the word, is laid down by God the lover of men, that his part is never to slacken, nor to be silent, whether men hear, or pass by.” This latter passage gives the more correct reference,—not so much to <i>his</i> opportunities, as the former, but to theirs); <b>convict, rebuke, exhort; in</b> (not <i>‘with</i>,’ it is not the <i>accompaniment</i> of the actions, but the clement, the temper in which they are to be performed) <b>all</b> (possible) <b>longsuffering and doctrine</b> (not subjective ‘<i>perseverance in teaching</i>,’ as Conybeare ; but <i>‘doctrine’</i> itself: it [objective] is to be the clement in which these acts take place, as well as <i>longsuffering</i> {subjective}.

And Esth. [apocryphal] xiv. 13, A. V., is quoted, “where Esther says concerning Artaxerxes, Put a word into my mouth <i>before the lion</i>.’ Whitby: —or, seeing that according to the chronology adopted by some, Nero was not in Rome at the time [see Introd. to Pastoral Epistles, § ii. 33], of his <i>locum tenens</i>, <i>Ælius Cæsareanus</i>,—or of the <i>Jewish accuser</i>. But these are hardly probable: nor again is it, that the Apostle was literally in danger of being thrown to wild beasts, and established his right as a Roman citizen to be exempted from that punishment: nor again is the idea, that the expression is figurative for <i>great danger,—the jaws of death</i>, or the like: for the Apostle <i>did not fear</i> death, but: looked forward to it as the end of his course, and certainly would not have spoken of it under this image. The <i>context</i> seems to me to demand another and very different interpretation. None stood with him—all forsook him: but the Lord stood by him and strengthened him: <i>for what</i>? that he might <i>witness a good confession</i>, and that the <i>preaching</i> might be expanded to the utmost. The result of this strengthening was, that he was delivered <i>from the mouth of the lion</i>: he was strengthened, w<i>itnessed a good confession, in spite of desertion and discouragement.</i> Then let us pass on to his confidence for the future, the expression of which is bound on to this sentence by the same verb, <b>shall deliver me</b>, indicating the identity of God’s deliverance, —and “<b>from every</b> evil work,” indicating the <i>generalization of the danger of which this was a particular case</i>. And how is the danger generally described? as “every <b>evil work</b>:” and it is implied that the falling into such danger would preclude him from enduring to Christ’s heavenly kingdom. It was then an <i>evil work</i> from which he was on this occasion delivered. What <i>evil work</i>? <i>The falling into the power of the tempter</i>; the giving way, in his own weakness and the desertion of all, and betraying the Gospel for which he was. sent as a witness. The <i>lion</i> then is the <i>devil</i> ; “who goeth about as a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour,” 1 Pet.v. 8).<h2><u><b>18.</b>]</u></h2> <b>The Lord</b> (Jesus) <b>shall deliver me from every evil work </b>(sce above: from every danger of faint-heartedness, and apostasy. The meaning adopted by some, that the <i>evil works</i> are the <i>works of his adversaries</i> plotting against him, is totally beside the purpose: he had no such confidence (ver. 6), nor would his conservation to Christ’s heavenly kingdom depend in the least upon such deliverance. Besides which, the correspondence of this declaration of confidence to the concluding petition of the Lord’s Prayer cannot surely be fortuitous, and then <i>evil</i>, here joined to <i>work</i> as neuter, must be subjective, evil resulting from our <i>falling</i> into temptation, not evil happening to us from without), <b>and shall preserve me safe</b> (shall <b>save</b> <i>me</i>: but in its not uncommon, pregnant sense of ‘bring safe’) <b>unto his kingdom in heaven</b> (though it may be conceded to De Wette that this expression is not otherwise found in St. Paul, it is one to which his existing expressions easily lead on: e.g.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/161vVy0o2te2uxPnTQb08Zuc-60K-zgkL/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And even if it were, the whole train of thought here leading naturally on to the ascription of such doxology, why should it not occur for the first and only time? It would seem to be an axiom with some critics, that a writer can never use an expression once only. If the expression be entirely out of keeping with his usual thoughts and diction, this may be a sound inference: but this is certainly not the case in the present, instance. Besides, the petition of the Lord’s Prayer having been transferred to our Lord as its fulfiller [compare John xiv. 13, 14], the doxology, which seems to have come into liturgical use almost as soon as the prayer itself, would naturally suggest a corresponding doxology here).<h2><u><b>19—21</b>.]</u></h2> <i>Salutations and notices.</i> <b>Sa- Inte Prisca and Aquila </b>(see notes, Acts xviii. 2: Rom. xvi. 3), <b>and the house of Onesiphorus </b>(himself probably deceased.

Thus, as there God is said to have given us grace in Christ from eternal ages, meaning that the gift took place as the result of a divine purpose fixed from eternity, so here He is said to have promised eternal life before eternal times, meaning that the promise took place as the result of a purpose fixed from eternity); <h2><u><b>3</b>.]</u></h2> <b>but</b> (contrast to the eternal and hidden purpose, and to the promise, just mentioned) <b>made manifest in its own seasons</b> (not, ‘<i>His own seasons</i>:’ —the times belonging to it,—fixed by Him for the manifestation) <b>His word</b> (we naturally expect the same object as before, viz. <i>eternal life</i>: but we have instead, <i>His word</i>,—i. e. the Gospel, see Rom. xvi. 25) <b>in</b> (as the element or vehicle of its manifesta- tion) <b>the proclamation</b> (see 2 Tim. iv. 17), <b>with which I was entrusted according to </b>(in pursuanee of) <b>the command of our Saviour God;</b> <h2><u><b>4</b>.]</u></h2> <b>to Titus</b> (see Introd. § i.), my true (genuine, see on 1 Tim. i, 2) <b>child according to</b> (in respect of, or agreeably to, in conformity with the ap- pointed spread and spiritually generative power of that faith) <b>the common faith </b>(common to us both and to all the people of God: hardly as Grotius, ‘to Jews, such as Paul, and Greeks such as Titus for there is no hint of such a distinction being brought out in this Epistle): <b>Grace and peace from God the Father</b> (see on 1 Tim. i, 2) <b>and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</b><h2><u>5—9.]</u></h2> <i>Reason stated for Titus being left in Crete—to appoint elders in its cities.

But. Theodoret ascribes the verse to Callimachus, in whose Hymn to Zeus, ver. 8, the words “the Cretans are always liars” are found. To this however Jerome [as also Epiphanius] answers, that Callimachus took the words from Epimenides.—EPIMENIDES was a native of Phæstus in Crete, and lived about 600 B.C. He was sent for to Athens to undertake the purification of the city from the pollution occasioned by Cylon (see articles ‘Epimenides’ and ‘Cylon,’ in the Dict. of Biography and Mythology), and is said to have lived to an extreme old age, and to have been buried at Lacedæmon. The appellation <i>‘prophet’</i> seems to have belonged to him in its literal sense: Cicero describes him as one of those who in an excitement of mind, or by its free motion, foretold future events: and Apuleius calls him an illustrious declarer of the fates, and a poet. And Diogenes Laertius tells us that the Cretans sacrificed to him as a god.—On the character here given of the Cretans, see Introd. to this Epistle, § ii. 9 ff. <b>slothful bellies</b> is said of those who by indulging their bodily appetites have become corpulent and indolent).<h2><u><b>13</b>.]</u></h2> <b>This testimony is true.

The maxim here is a truly Christian one of the noblest order.—As usual in these Epistles [see Introd. § i. 88], <i>purity</i> is inseparably connected with soundness in the faith, compare Acts xv. 9,—and 1 Tim. iv. 8, where our words, “<i>to the pure</i>,” are expanded into “<i>those who are faithful and know the truth</i>”): <b>but to the polluted and unbelieving </b>(see the preceding remarks) <b>nothing is pure; but both</b> (or <i>‘even</i>,’ as A.

V., “<i>glorious appearing</i>,” by which the whole sense is obscured) <b>of the great God</b> (the Father: see below) <b>and of our Saviour Jesus Christ</b> (as regards the sense, an exact parallel is found in Matt. xvi. 27, “<i>The Son of man is about to come in the glory of His Father</i>,” compared with Matt. xxv. 31, “<i>When the Son of man shall come in His glory.</i>” See also 1 Pet. iv. 13. The glory which shall be revealed at the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ is <i>His own</i> glory, <i>and</i> that <i>of His Father</i> [John xvii, 3; 1 Thess. iii. 13]. This sense has been obscured by the foolish rendering of the A.V. see above. And we now come to consider the meaning of the words <i>the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ</i>. Two views have been taken of them: (1) that <b>the great God and our Saviour</b> are to be taken together as the description of <b>Jesus Christ</b>, —‘<i>of Jesus Christ, the great God and our Saviour</i>: (2) that, as given above, <b>the great God </b>describes the Father, and <b>our Saviour Jesus Christ</b> the Son. It is obvious that in dealing with (1), we shall be deciding with regard to (2) also. (1) has been the view of the Greek orthodox Fathers, and of most ancient and modern Commentators. That the former so interpreted the words, is obviously not [as it has been considered] decisive of the question, if they can be shewn to bear legitimately another meaning, and that meaning to be the one most likely to have been in the mind of the writer. The passage must be argued primarily on its own ground, not primarily on the consensus of the Greek Fathers. No one disputes that it <i>may</i> mean that which they have inter- preted it: and there were obvious reasons why they, having licence to do so, should choose this interpretation. But it is our object, not being swayed, in this or any other interpretation, by doctrinal considerations one way or the other, to enquire, not what the words <i>may</i> mean, but what they <i>do</i> mean, as far as we may be able to ascertain it.—I have in my Greek ‘Test. argued first from the construction of the sentence, and then from the Apostle’s usage of the expression “God our Saviour:” and from both of these considerations I have deduced that it is not probable he meant to apply the whole of this to our Lord, but the former portion to the Father, and the latter to the Son. The reasoning on the second point may be intelligible to the English reader. The expression “<i>God our Saviour</i>” occurs six times in these Epistles, once in Luke (i. 47], and once in the Epistle of Jude. If the writer <i>here</i> identities this expression, ‘the great God and our Saviour,’ with the Lord Jesus Christ, calling Him *God and our Saviour,’ it will be at least probable that in other places where he speaks of “God our Saviour,” he also designates our Lord Jesus Christ. Now is that so? On the contrary, in I Tim.i. 1,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ioMtrDb_G25SqPRzbKNiXFxSbvPpye9i/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 2, Part 1, Page 739:</a></h3><br><i>we have the command of God our Saviour and of Christ Jesus our hope</i>: where I suppose none will deny that the Father and the Son are most plainly distinguished from one another. The same is the case in 1 Tim, ii. 3—5, a passage bearing much [see below] on the interpretation of this one: and consequently in 1 Tim. iv. 10, where “<i>is the Saviour of all men</i>” corresponds to “<i>willeth all to be saved</i>” in the other. So also in Titus i. 8, where “<i>our Saviour God</i>,” by whose “<i>command</i>” the promise of eternal life was manifested, with the proclamation of which St. Paul was entrusted, is the same “<i>eternal God</i>,’ by whose “<i>command</i>” the hidden mystery was manifested in Rom. xvi. 26, where the same distinction is made. The only place where there could be any doubt is in our ver. 10, which possible doubt however is removed by ver. 11, where the same assertion is made, of the revelation of the hidden grace of God [the Father]. Then we have our own ch. iii. 4—6, where we find “<i>our Saviour God</i>” in ver. 4, clearly defined as the Father, and “<i>through Jesus Christ our Saviour</i>” in ver. 6. In the one passage of St. Jude, the distinction is equally clear: for there we have “<i>to the only God our Saviour, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</i>” It is plain then, that the usage of the words ‘<i>God our Saviour</i>’ does not make it probable that the whole expression here is to be applied to the Lord Jesus Christ. And in estimating this probability, let us again recur to 1 Tim. ii. 3, 5, a passage which runs very parallel with the present one. We read there, “For there is one God, | and one Mediator between God and men, Christ Jesus, himself man, who gave Himself a ransom,” &ce. Compare this with “the great God | and our Saviour Jesus Christ, who gave Himself a ransom for us,” &c. Can there be a reasonable doubt, that the Apostle writing two sentences so closely corresponding, on a point of such high importance, would have in his view the same distinction in the second of them, which he so strongly lays down in the first ?—Without then considering the question as closed, I would submit that (2) satisfies all the requirements of the sentence: that it is both structurally and contextually more probable, and mere agreeable to the Apostle’s way of writing: and I have therefore preferred it. Whichever way taken, the passage is just as important a testimony to the divinity of our Saviour: according to (1), by asserting His possession of Deity and right to the appellation of the Highest : according to (2), even more strikingly, asserting His equality in glory with the Father, in a way which would be blasphemy if predicated of any of the sons of men); <b>who</b> (our Saviour Jesus Christ) <b>gave Himself </b>(“the forcible ‘Himself, His whole self, the greatest gift ever given,’ must not be overlooked.” Ellicott) <b>for us</b> (‘on our behalf, not ‘<i>in our stead</i>’), <b>that He might </b>(by this assertion of the Redeemer’s purpose, we return to the moral aim of verses 11, 12, more plainly indicated as in close connexion with Christ’s propitiatory sacrifice) <b>redeem</b> (‘<i>buy off with a price</i>.’ See note, 1 Tim. ii. 6: and compare 1 Pet. i. 18, where the price is stated to have been the precious blood of Christ) <b>us from all iniquity</b> (lawlessness : see 1 John iii. 4, “<i>sin is lawlessness</i>”), <b>and might purify</b> (by this statement that the Redeemer’s object was to purify to Himself a peculiar people, and not “<i>us</i>” merely, His purpose is lifted off from our particular ease, and generally and obJectively stated) <b>to Himself a people peculiarly His</b> (see note on Eph. i. 14; also 1 Pet. ii. 9), <b>zealous</b> (an ardent. worker and promoter) <b>of good works</b>.<h2><u><b>15</b>.]</u></h2> gathers up all since ver. 1, where the general command last appeared, and en- forces it on Titus, In ch. iii. 1, the train of thought is again resumed.—<b>These things </b>(the foregoing: not, the following) <b>speak, and exhort</b> (in the case of those who be- lieve and need stirring up), <b>and rebuke</b> (in the case of those who are rebellious) with<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nCGAbuRLvdGa5DazUXwHowQoBRIg-bhB/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For aught that this pluperfect would assert, our salvation might be prompted on God’s part by future works of righteousness which He foresaw we should do. Whereas the simple past tense throws the whole into the same time.—“His goodness, &e. was manifested . . . not for works which we did . - .

On the part of God, that act is one—in the application of it to individuals, it is composed of many and successive acts. But this being contemporaneous with the verb appeared above, cannot apply to our individual salvation alone. At the same time, standing as it does in a transitional position, between God’s objective act and the subjective individual application of it, it no doubt looks forward as well as backward—to individual realization of salvation, as well as to the divine completion of it once for all in Christ. —The “<i>us</i>” here is not <i>all mankind</i>, which would be inconsistent with what follows, —nor <i>all Christians</i>, however true that would be,—but the same as are indicated by “<i>and we</i>” above,—the particular Christians in the Apostle’s view us he was writing —Titus and his Cretan converts, and himself), <b>by means of the laver</b> (not <i>‘washing</i>,’ as A.

It occurs only in Matt. xix. 28, and there in an objective sense, whereas here it is evidently subjective.

The font then, the laver of regeneration, representing the external portion of the Sacrament, and pledging the internal,—that <i>inward and spiritual grace</i>, necessary to the completion of the Sacrament and its regenerating power, is not, as too often, left to follow as a matter of course, and thus baptismal regeneration rendered a mere formal and unmeaning thing, ‘ex opere operato,’—but is distinctly stated in the following words), <b>and</b> (understand through again: so Theodoret and Bengel, who says, “Two things are spoken of: the laver of regeneration, which is a way of expressing baptism into Christ, and the renewing of the Holy Ghost.” On the other hand, most Commentators [see Ellicott here] take <i>renewing</i> as a second genitive after <i>font</i> (of regeneration and of the renewing, &c.) the renewal (the word is used of the gradual renewal of heart and life in the image of God, following upon the new birth, and without which the birth is a mere abortion, not leading on to vitality and action.

I. 1 – II. 18.]</u></h1> </b>AFTER MANIFOLD REVELATIONS IN FORMER TIMES, GOD HAS NOW REVEALED HIMSELF TO US IN HIS SON (i, 1–4), WHO IS GREATER THAN THE ANGELS, THE DISPENSERS OF THE LAW (i, 4—14; inference, ii, 1–4), THOUGH FOR A TIME HE WAS MADE LOWER THAN THE ANGELS, AND SUBJECTED TO SUFFERINGS, IN ORDER TO BE, AS OUR HIGH PRIEST, OUR RECONCILER TO GOD (ii. 5–18). And herein (i. 1–4), <i>introduction and statement of position.</i><br><br>We may notice, 1. The opening of this Epistle without any address, or mention of the Author. Various reasons have been assigned for this, and inferences drawn from it (see Introduction). Some have said that the matter to be treated was so weighty, that the Writer merged altogether his own personality, and trusted to the weight of his subject to gain him a hearing. But this would not account for entire omission of the name of the man and his standing. Some have therefore imagined that another shorter letter of a more private nature must have accompanied this. But we may reply, that this idea derives no countenance from the phænomena of the Epistle itself, containing as it does at the end private notices which might well have been dispensed with, if such a commendatory Epistle had accompanied it. We must therefore deal with this circumstance without any such hypothesis to help us. On the supposition of the authorship by St. Paul, some account may be given of it,—viz. that the name of the Apostle was concealed, from the nature of the relations between himself, and those to whom he was writing (see this hypothesis examined in the Introduction). And on the idea of <i>superintendence</i> by St. Paul, it would obviously admit of the same solution. 2. The carefully balanced and rhetorical style in which the Epistle begins, characteristic indeed of its whole diction, but especially marking this first period (vv. 1–4), The clauses are joined by close grammatical and rhetorical dependence: there is no breaking off, and no carelessness of construction, but all is most carefully and skilfully disposed.<h2><u><b>1.]</u></h2> In many portions</b> (or ‘parts,’ manifoldly as regards the <i>distribution</i>. “For not <i>all</i> things, nor <i>the same</i> things, were revealed to all the prophets, but the parts of great mysteries were distributed among them. E.g., Isaiah was inspired to foretell Christ’s birth from a virgin, and His Passion: Daniel, the time of His Advent: Jonah, His burial: Malachi, the coming of His Forerunner. And again some had more, others less, revealed to them.” Estius, <i>‘At sundry times’</i> (A.V.) is not an accurate rendering, nor can it he said to <i>express</i> the meaning: <i>time</i> is a historical condition of the sequence of parts,—<i>persons to whom,</i> an anthropological condition,—but it does not follow that <i>‘at sundry times’</i> or <i>‘to sundry persons,’ gives the force of ‘in divers parts:’</i> because it might be the same thing which was revealed again and again. This revelation in portions, by fragments, in and by various persons, was necessarily an imperfect revelation, to which the one final manifestation in and by One Person<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uYMlbODoioLLOy-UPeLkBK78LCDpLit1/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Isaiah, Daniel, and Ezekiel saw differing forms of vision.” Theodoret. Bleek remarks, that in Numb. xii. 6—8, the diversity of manner of revelation is recognized : dreams and visions being set beneath that open speaking, mouth to mouth, which the Lord used towards His servant Moses. It will be seen, that I cannot agree with Chrysostom and many others in regarding the two adverbs as a mere rhetorical redundance,—meaning merely, “ differently.” Both set forth the imperfection of the Old Test. revelations. They were various in nature and in form: fragments of the whole truth, presented in manifold forms, in shifting hues of separated colour: Christ is the full revelation of God, Himself the pure light, uniting in His one Person the whole spectrum: see below on ver. 3) <b>in time past</b> (generally interpreted of the Old Test. period, ending with Malachi. But there is no need for cutting off the period there. In the interim between Malachi and the Writer’s time, though the Old Test. canon was closed, we cannot say that God’s manifold revelations of Himself had absolutely ceased. Nay, strictly speaking, the Baptist himself be- longed to the former, though he pointed on to the latter period. No doubt he was not here in the Writer’s view, and the period of former revelations is here regarded as distinct from the final Christian one: but for all that, we must not put an artificial terminus where he puts none) <b>God having spoken to the fathers</b> (so in reff. The term <i>“the fathers”</i> is absolutely used in John vii. 22; Acts xiii. 32; Rom. ix. 5; xi. 28; xv. 8; 2 Pet. iii. 4. It is evident from this term being common to the Writer and his readers, where no reference is made to Jews in the context [as in Rom. ix. 5], that he was writing as 4 Jew and to Jews) <b>in</b> (not equivalent to <i>“by,”</i> though it includes it. The <b>in</b> designates the <i>element in which</i> the <i>speaking</i> takes place, and holds therefore its own proper force. God spoke <i>in</i> the prophets, being resident in them. Bengel draws a distinction,—a human king speaks by his ambassadors, but not in them) <b>the prophets </b>(to be taken here apparently in the wider sense,—as including not only those whose inspired writings form the Old Test. canon, but all who were vehicles of the divine self-manifestation to the Fathers. Thus Enoch in Jude 14 is said to have <i>prophesied</i>. Moses is of course included, and indeed would on any view be the <i>chief</i> of those here spoken of, seeing that by him the greater part of God’s revelation of Himself to the fathers was made).<h2><u><b>2.]</u></h2> at the end of these days</b> (in order to understand this expression, it will be well to call to mind certain Jewish modes of speaking of time. The Rabbis divided the whole of time into <i>“this age,”</i> and <i>“the age to come.”</i> The days of the Messiah were regarded as a period of transition from the former to the latter,—His appearance, as the ushering in of the termination of <i>“these days,”</i> the beginning of the end,— and His second coming in glory as the accomplishment of <i>“these days”</i> or <i>“this age.”</i> And with this, New Test. usage agrees,—see 1 Pet. i. 20; James v. 3; Jude 18; 2 Pet. iii. 3. Thus <b>at the end of these days</b> would mean, ‘at the end of <i>this age,’</i> in the technical sense of these words as signifying the whole world-period, the latter boundary of which is the Resurrection. And thus is the manifestation of Christ in the flesh ever spoken of, and especially in this Epistle; compare ch. ix. 26; and notes on ch. ii. 5; vi.5. Stuart has mistaken the meaning, in rendering <i>‘during the last dispensation,’</i> and making <i>“these”</i> to import that the period had already <i>begun</i>. It is not of a beginning, but of an <i>expiring</i> period, the Writer is speaking. The ancient expositors principally use these words as ground of <i>consolation:</i> those who were in conflict would be consoled on hearing that it was soon to end) <b>spake</b> (not <i>‘hath spoken:’</i> the <b>end</b> just spoken of is looked back on as a definite point, at which the divine revelation took place. The attention of the readers is thus directed not so much to the present state in which they are, as to the act of God towards them) <b>unto us</b> (i.e. all who have heard that voice, or to whom it is to be announced. There is no distinction between those who received God’s revelation immediately from the Son, and those who received immediately through others. <br><br><b>To this latter</b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/158rIGjRssLj22-VAw0MgWkvMtoWpmZVZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

We now pass off into a description of the dignity, and person, and work, of this Son of God: which description ends in asserting and proving Him to be higher than angels, the loftiest of created beings) <b>whom He constituted</b> (not, <i>“hath constituted,”</i> or <i>“appointed :”</i> referring, as also does <b>made</b>, which follows, to the time, <i>“in the beginning,”</i>—the date of the eternal counsel of God) <i>heir</i> (“appropriately, after the mention of <i>Sonship</i>, comes <i>inheritance.”</i> Bengel. <b>That heir</b> is not equivalent to <i>“lord”</i> simply, is plain: the same expression could not have been used of the Father. It is in virtue of the Sonship of our Lord that the Father constituted Him heir of all things, before the worlds began. “In Him also,” says Delitzsch, “culminates the fulfilment of the promise given to the seed of Abraham, that he should be heir of the world.” See below. See for St. Paul’s use of the word and image, Gal. iv. 7) <b>of all things</b> (“that is, of the whole world.” Chrysostom. And we cannot give this a more limited sense, nor restrict it to this world ; especially as the subsequent portion of the chapter distinctly includes the angels in it. It is much disputed whether this heirship of Christ is to be conceived as belonging to Him essentially in his divine nature, or as accruing to Him from his work of redemption in the human nature. The Fathers, and the majority of the moderns, decide for the latter alternative. “The Lord Christ is the heir of all things,” says Theodoret, “not as God, but as man.” And so the Socinian and quasi-Socinian interpreters, arriving at the same view by another way, not believing the præ-existence of Christ. But it is plain that such an interpretation will not snit the requirements of the passage. For this humiliation of His, with its effects, first comes in at the end of ver. 3. All this, now adduced, is referable to his essential Being as Son of God; not merely in the Godhead before his Incarnation, but also in the Manhood after it, which no less formed a part of His “constitution” by the Father, thin His Godhead itself, So that the word <i>“constituted”</i> or <i>“appointed,”</i> as observed above, must be taken not as an appoint- ment in prospect of the Incarnation, but as an absolute appointment, coincident with the <i>“this day have I begotten Thee,”</i> belonging to the eternal Sonship of the Lord, though wrought out in full by his mediatorial work), <b>by whom</b> (by means of whom, as His acting Power and personal instrument : so Theophylact : “Since the Father is the cause of the Son, He is also of the things which were made by Him. The Father, who begat the Son their maker, seems to make them Himself”) <b>He also made</b> (<i>created</i>. The word brought into emphasis by <b>also</b> is not <i>the world</i>, but <b>made</b>. “He not only appointed the Son heir of all things, before the Creation; but He also <i>made</i> the worlds by Him.” Bengel) <b>the ages</b> (so literally; but the meaning of the term has been much disputed. ‘The main classes of interpreters are two. (1) Those who see in the word its ordinary meaning of <i>‘an age of time:’</i> (2) those who do not recognize such meaning, but suppose it to have been merged in that of <i>“the world,”</i> or <i>“the worlds.”</i> To (1) belong the Greek Fathers; and. some: others. On the other hand, (2) is the view of the majority of Commentators. It is explained and defended at length by Bleek, none of whose examples however seem to me to be void of the same ambiguity which characterizes the expression here. The Jews, it appears, came at length to designate by their phrase, “the present age,” not only the present age, but all things in and belonging to it—and so of the “future age” likewise. He therefore would regard <b>the ages</b> as strictly parallel with <i>“all things”</i> above, and would in- terpret, ‘Whom He has constituted lord, possessor and ruler over all, over the whole world, even as by Him He has made all, the universe,’ And nearly so Delitzsch, Ebrard, and Lünemann: these two latter adding however somewhat, inasmuch as they take it of all this state of things constituted in time and space. And this last view I<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZavMDfMvps5f8B-EQI2wWlambkC-gBai/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

So that the universe, as well in its great primæval conditions,— the reaches of Space, and the ages of Time, as in all material objects and all successive events, which furnish out and people Space and Time, God made by Christ. It will be plain that what has been here said will apply equally to ch. xi. 3, which is commonly quoted as decisive for the <i>material</i> sense here. Some have endeavoured to refer <i>the ages</i> (3) to the new or spiritual world, or the ages of the Messiah, or of the Christian Church: principally in the interests of Socinianism: or (4), to the various dispensations of God’s revelation of Himself: or even (5), as Fabricius, to the Gnostic sons, or emanations from the divine Essence, and so to the higher spiritual order of beings, the angels. Against all these, besides other considerations, ch. xi. 3 is a decisive testimony). It will be seen by consulting the note on John i. 1, how very near the teaching of Philo approached to this creation of the universe by the Son.<h2><u><b>3.]</u></h2></b> “The Son of God now becomes Himself the subject. The verb belonging to the relative <b>who</b> is not found till <i>‘sat down’</i> at the end of the verse. But the intermediate participial clauses do not stand in the same relation to the main sentence. The first members, <i>‘being, &c.,”</i> still set forth those attributes of the Son of God which are of a permanent character, and belonging to Him before the Incarnation: whereas the following member, the last participial clause, stands in nearer relation to the main sentence, expressing as it does the purification of mankind from sin, wrought by the incarnate Son of God, as one individual historical event,—as the antecedent of that exaltation of Him to the right hand of God, which the main sentence enounces.” Bleck.<br><br><b>Who</b> (this represents, it will be evident, rather the præ-existent than the incarnate Word. But it is perhaps a mistake to let this distinction be too prominent, and would lead to the idea of a change having taken place in the eternal relation of the Son to the Father, when He subjected himself to the conditions of space and time.

See Wisd. vii, 26, where wisdom is called “the brightness of the everlasting light.” And this (which, as Delitzsch remarks, is represented by the “light of light” of the Nicene Creed) seems to have been universally the sense among the ancients: no trace whatever being found of the meaning <i>‘reflexion.’</i> Nor would the idea he apposite here: the Son of God is, in this his essential majesty, the expression, and the sole expression, of the divine Light, —not, as in his Incarnation, its reflexion) <b>of His glory</b> (not simply <i>His light</i> ; nor need the expression be confined to such literal sense.

And this last seems to be the best meaning: in our place: His <i>essential being</i>, His <i>substance</i>. For in regarding the history of the word, we find that the well-known theological meaning <i>‘person,’</i> was not by any means generally received during the first four centuries. The Nicene Council itself uses <i>“hypostasis”</i> and <i>“essence”</i> in the same sense, and condemns the deriving the Son from another hypostasis or essence from the Father: and so usually Athanasius. The fact was, that the Easterns most commonly used the term to designate the three separate Persons: whereas the Westerns continued to regard it as equivalent to <i>essence</i>, and assumed but one <i>hypostasis:</i> and the Western bishops, assembled with Athanasius at the council of Sardica in 347, distinctly pronounced the assumption of three <i>hypostases</i> heretical, i.e. Arian. Subsequently, however, to this, in the Synod assembled at Alexandria in 362, at which Athanasius, and bishops of Italy, Arabia, Egypt, and Libya were present, the Easterns and Westerns agreed, on examination of one another's meaning, to acknowledge one another as orthodox, and to allow indifferently of the use of <i>three hypostases,</i> signifying ‘Persons,’ and <i>one hypostasis,</i> signifying substance, essence. On all grounds it will be safer here to hold to the primitive meaning of the word, and not to introduce into the language of the apostolic age a terminology which was long subsequent to it), <b>and upholding</b> (bearing up. The Rabbinical writings speak of God as <i>carrying all the worlds by His strength</i>) <b>the universe</b> (the meaning attempted to be given by some Socinian expositors, “the whole kingdom of grace,” is wholly beside the purpose : see Col. i. 17; Job. viii. 3; Rev. iv. 11) <b>by the word</b> (<i>expressed command:</i> compare ch. xi. 3) <b>of his</b> (Whose? His own, or the Fathers? ‘The latter is held by Cyril of Alexandria. And so Grotius and others. But Chrysostom and the great body of Commentators understand <b>his</b> to refer to the Son. The strict parallelism of the clauses would seem to require, that <i>his</i> here should designate the same person, as it does before in this same verse. But such parallelism aud consistency of reference of demonstrative pronouns is by no means observed in the New Test., e.g. Eph. i 20, 22, “And placed Him at His right hand (of the Father), .... and put all things under His feet” (of the Son). In every such ease the reference must be determined by the circumstances, and the things spoken of. And applying that test here, we find that in our former clause it is quite out of the question that <b>his</b> should be reflective, referring, as it clearly does, to another than the subject of the sentence. But when we proceed to our second clause, we find no such bar to the ordinary reflective sense of <b>his</b>, but every reason to adopt it as the most obvious. For we have here an action performed by the Son, who <i>upholds the universe.</i> Whereby ? <b>By the word of His power:</b> where we may certainly say 1) that had another than the subject of the sentence been intended, such intention would have been expressed: and 2) that the assertion would be after all a strange and unexampled one, that the Son. upholds all things by the word of the Father's power, So that, on all accounts, this second <b>his</b> seems better to be referred to the Son) <b>power</b> (not to be weakened into the comparatively unmeaning “his powerful word.” His Power is an inherent attribute, whether uttered or not: the <b>word</b> is that utterance, which He has been pleased to give of it. It is a “powerful word,” but much more is here stated—that it is the word of, proceeding from, giving utterance to, His power), <b>having</b> (or, <b>when He had</b>) <b>made</b> (the vulgate, <i>“making,”</i> is an unfortunate mistranslation, tending to obscure the truth of the completion of the one Sacrifice of the Lord. The words <i>“by Himself”</i> can hardly be retained in the text, in the face of their omission in the most ancient MSS., joined to their internal character as an explanatory gloss. Meanwhile, the gloss is a good and true one. It was by <i>Himself,</i> in the fullest sense) <b>purification of sins</b> (as Bleck observes, there is no occasion to suppose the genitive here equivalent to <i>“from sins,”</i> seeing that we may say, <i>“the sins of a man are purified,”</i> as we read, Matt. viii. 3, <i>“his leprosy was cleansed.”</i> Sin was the great uncleanness, of which He has effected the purga-<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i_xU1bftnp6qKtayzihBpPP3NW8XzfOj/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This <i>purification</i> must be understood by the subsequent argument in the Epistle: for that which the Writer had it in his mind to expand in the course of his treatise, he must be supposed to have meant when he used without explanation a concise term, like this. And that we know to have been, the purifications and sacrifices of the Levitical law, by which man’s natural uncleanness in God’s sight was typically removed, and access to God laid open to him. Ebrard’s note here is so important that, though long, I cannot forbear inserting it. “The term <b>purification</b> answers to the Hebrew, and its ideal explanation must be sought in the meaning which suits the Levitical cleansing in the Old Test. worship. Consequently, they are entirely wrong, who understand this <i>purification</i> of moral amelioration, and would so take the <i>‘making purification’</i> in this place, as if the author wished to set forth Christ here as a moral teacher, who by precept and example incited men to amendment, And we pronounce those in error, who go so far indeed as to explain the <i>purification</i> of the propitiatory removal of the guilt of sin, but only on account of later passages in our Epistle, as if the idea of scriptural <i>purification</i> were not already sufficiently clear to establish this, the only true meaning. The whole law of purification, as given by God to Moses, rested on the assumption that our nature, as sinful and guilt-laden, is not capable of coming into immediate contact with our holy God and Judge. The mediation between man and God present in the most holy place, and in that most holy place separated from the people, was revealed in three forms; (<i>a</i>) in sacrifices, (<i>b</i>) in the Priesthood ; and (<i>c</i>) in the Levitical laws of purity. Sacrifices were [typical] acts or means of propitiation for guilt; Priests were the agents for accomplishing these acts, but were not themselves accounted purer than the rest of the people, having consequently to bring offerings for their own sins before they offered for those of the people. Lastly, Levitical purity was the condition which was attained, positively by sacrifice and worship, negatively by avoidance of Levitical pollution,—the condition in which the people was enabled, by means of the priests, to come into relation with God ‘without dying’ [Deut. v. 26]; the result of the cultus which was past, and the postulate for that which was to come. So that that which purified, was sacrifice : and the purification was, the removal of guilt. This is most clearly seen in the ordinance concerning the great day of atonement, Lev. xvi. There we find those three leading features in the closest distinctive relation. First, the sacrifice must be prepared [vv. 1–10]: then, the High Priest is to offer for his own sins [vv. 11—14]: lastly, he is to kill the sin-offering for the people [ver. 15], and with its blood to sprinkle the mercy-seat and all the holy place, and cleanse it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel [ver. 19]; and then he is symbolically to lay the sins of the people on the head of a second victim, and send forth this animal, laden with the curse, into the wilderness. For [ver. 30] ‘on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the Lord.’ In the atonement, in the gracious <i>covering</i> of the guilt of sin, consists <i>purification</i> in the scriptural sense. [And so also were those who had become levitically unclean, e.g., lepers, Levit. xiv., cleansed by atoning sacrifices.] So that an Israelitish reader, a Christian Jew, would never, on reading the words <b>made purification</b>, think on what we commonly call ‘moral amelioration,’ which, if not springing out of the living ground of a heart reconciled to God, is mere self deceit, and only external avoidance of evident transgression: but the <b>purification</b> which Christ brought in would, in the sense of our author and his readers, only be understood of that gracious atonement for all guilt of sin of all mankind, which Christ our Lord and Saviour has completed for us by His sinless sufferings and death : and out of which flows forth to us, as from a fountain, all power to love in return, all love to Him, our heavenly Pattern, and all hatred of sin, which caused His death. To speak these words of Scripture with the mouth is easy: but he only can say Yea and Amen to them with the heart who, in simple truthfulness of the knowledge of himself, has looked down even to the darkest depths of his ruined state, natural to him, and intensified by innumerable sins of act,—and, despairing of all help in himself,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p8RQ3dpBgC09dtX9JTsu_7PsBEF0QOjh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The expression comes doubtless originally from Ps. cx. 1, cited below. Bleek, in the course of a long and thorough discussion of its meaning as applied to our Lord, shews that it is never used of his priæ-existent coequality with the Father, but always with reference to His exaltation in his humanity after his course of suffering and triumph. It is ever connected, not with the idea of His equality with the Father and share in the majesty of the Godhead, but with His state of waiting, in the immediate presence of the Father, and thus highly exalted by Him, till the purposes of his mediatorial office are accomplished. This his lofty state is, however, not one of quiescence; for (Acts ii. 33) He shed down the gift of the Spirit, —and (Rom. viii. 34) He maketh intercession for us: and below (ch. viii. 1 ff.) He is, for all purposes belonging to that office, our High Priest in Heaven. This <i>“sitting at the right hand of God”</i> is described as lasting until all enemies shall have been subdued unto Him, i.e. until the end of this state of time, and his own second coming: after which, properly and strictly speaking, the state of exaltation described by these words shall come to an end, and that mysterious completion of the supreme glory of the Son of God shall take place, which St. Paul describes, 1 Cor. xv. 28) <b>of Majesty</b> (this word <b>majesty</b> is often found in the Septuagint, and principally as referring to the divine greatness) <b>on high</b> (<i>in high places,</i> i.e. <i>in heaven</i>.

In the same sense we have <i>“in the highest,”</i> Luke ii. 14; xix. 38; Job xvi. 20; Ecclus. xxvi. 16; Matt. xxi. 9; Mark xi. 10, Ebrard says: “HEAVEN, in Holy Scripture, signifies never unbounded space, nor omnipresence, but always either the starry firmament, or, more usually, that sphere of the created world of space and time, where the union of God with the personal creature is not severed by sin,—where no Death reigns, where the glorification of the body is not a mere hope of the future. Into that sphere has the Firstling of risen and glorified manhood entered, as into a place, with visible glorified Body, visibly to return again from thence.” The omission of the article <i>“the”</i> here gives majesty and solemnity —its insertion would seem to hint at other <i>majesties</i> in the background), <b>having become</b> (distinct from <i>“being,”</i> ver. 3: that, importing His essential, this, His superinduced state. For we are are now, in the course of the enunciation,—which has advanced to the main subject of the argument, the proving of the superiority of the New Covenant,—treating of the post-incarnate majesty of the Son of God. HE WAS all that has been detailed in ver. 3: He made purification of sins, and sat down at the right hand of the majesty on high, and thus BECAME this which is now spoken of. This is denied by Chrysostom, but recognized by ‘Theodoret, in a form however not strictly exact: for he applied it <i>only to the Humanity</i> of our Lord. To this Bleck very properly objects, that the making this exaltation belong only to Christ’s human nature, and supposing Him to have while on earth possessed still the fulness of the majesty of his Godhead, is not according to the usage of our Writer, nor of the New Test. generally, and in fact induces something like a double personality in the Son of God. The Scriptures teach us that He who was with God before the creation, from love to men put on flesh, and took the form of a servant, not all the while having on Him the whole fulness of his divine nature and divine glory, but having really and actually emptied himself of this fulness and glory, so that there was not only a hiding, but an absolute <i>inanition,</i> a putting off, of it. Therefore His subsequent exaltation must be conceived of as belonging, not to his Humanity only, but to the entire undivided Person of Christ, now resuming the fulness and glory of the Godhead (John xvii. 5), and in addition to this having taken into the Godhead the Manhood, now glorified by his obedience, atonement, and victory. See Eph.i. 20–22; Phil. ii.6–9; Acts ii. 36; 1 Pet. iii. 21,22.

It is used only three times by St. Paul, and never [unless 1 Cor. xii. 31, in the received text, be counted] in this sense: but thirteen times in this Epistle) <b>the angels</b> (of God; the heavenly created beings; afterwards, ver. 14, called <i>“ministering spirits.”</i> All attempts to evade this plain meaning are futile; and proceed on ignorance of the argument of our Epistle, and of the Jewish theology. But <i>why</i> should the angels be here brought in? and why should the superiority of the Incarnate Son of God to them be so insisted on and elaborated? Bleek gives a very insufficient reason, when he says that the mention of God’s throne brought to the Writer’s mind the angels who are the attendants there. The reason, as Ebrard remarks, lies far deeper. The whole Old Test. dispensation is related to the New Test. dispensation, as the angels to the Son. In the former, mankind, and Israel also, stands separated from God by sin: and angels, divine messengers [as in the expression “the angel of the covenant”), stand as mediators between man and God. And of these there is, so to speak, a chain of two links: viz., Moses, and the angel of the Lord. The first link is a mere man, who is raised above his fellow-men by his calling, by his office, the commission given to him,—and brought nearer to God; but he is a sinner as they are, and is in reality no more a partaker of the divine nature than they are. The second link is the angelic form in which God revealed Himself to his people, coming down to their capacity, like to man, without being man. So that Godhead and Manhood approximated to one another: a man was com- missioned and enabled to hear God’s word: God appeared in a form in which men might see Him: but the two found no point of contact; no real union of the Godhead and the Manhood took place. Whereas in the Son, God and the Manhood not only approximated, but became personally one. God no longer accommodates Himself to the capacities of men in an angelophany or theophany, but has revealed the fulness of his divine nature in the man Jesus,—in that He, who was the <i>brightness</i> of his glory, became man. The argument of the Writer necessarily then leads him to shew how both Mediators, the angel of the Old Test. covenant, and Moses, found their higher unity in Christ. First, he shews this of the angel or angels [for it was not always one individual angelic being, but various] by whom the first covenant was given: then of Moses, ch. iii. iv. This first portion is divided into two: vv. 4—14, in which he shews that the Son, as the eternal Son of God, is higher than the angels [see the connexion of this with the main argument below]: then, after an exhortation [ii. 1–4] founded on this, tending also to impress on us the superior holiness of the New Test. revelation, the second part [ii. 5–18] in which he shews that in the Son, the manhood also is exalted above the angels), <b>in proportion as he hath inherited</b> (as his own: the word being perhaps chosen in reference to the Old Test. prophecies, which promised it to Him : see below. The <i>perfect</i> is important, as denoting something belonging to His present and abiding state, not an event wholly past, as <i>“sat down”</i> above, indicating the first “setting himself down,” though that word might also be used of a permanent state of session) <b>a more distinguished</b> (or, <b>more excellent</b>) <b>name</b> (to be taken in its proper sense, not understood to mean precedence or dignity as ver. 5 shews: whence also we get an easy answer to the enquiry, <i>what name</i> is intended : viz. that of <b>Son</b>, in the peculiar and individual sense of the citation there. ‘The angels themselves are called <i>“sons of God,”</i> Job i. 6; ii. 1; xxxviii. 7: Dan. iii. 25, and Gen. vi. 2 [see Jude 6 note, and Introd. to Jude, § v. 11]: but the argument here is that the title “SON OF GOD” is bestowed on him individually, in a sense in which it never was conferred upon an angel. See as a parallel, Phil. ii. 9 ff. It must be remembered, as Delitzsch beautifully remarks, that the fulness of glory of the peculiar name of the Son of God is unattainable by human speech or thought: it is, Rev. xix. 12, <i>“a name which none knoweth but Himself.”</i> And all the citations aud appellations here are but<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d_NjVgoiyA7XHY6fHP2OlE6Ck-xlXCX9/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The answer must not be hastily made, as by some Commentators, that the term <b>inherited</b> implies the glorification of the humanity of Christ to that Sonship which He before had in virtue of his Deity. Evidently so partial a reference cannot be considered as exhausting the sense of the Writer. Nor again can we say that it was at the time of His incarnation, though the words of the angel in Luke i. 35, <i>“That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God,”</i> seem to favour such a reference : for it was especially at His incarnation, that He was made <i>a little lower than the angels</i>, ch. ii. 9. Rather would the sense seem to be, that the especial name of SON, belonging to Him not by ascription nor adoption, but by His very Being itself, has been ever, and is now, His: <i>inherited</i> by Him, “in that He is the very Son of God,” as Chrysostom says: the Old Test. declarations being as it were portions of the instrument by which this inheritance is assured to Him, and by the citation of which it is proved. Observe that the <i>having become better than the angels</i> is not <i>identical with</i> the <i>inheriting,</i> but <i>in proportion to</i> it: the triumphant issue of his Mediation is consonant to the glorious Name, which is His by inheritance: but which, in the fulness of its present inconceivable glory [see above], has been put on and taken up by Him in the historical process of his mediatorial humiliation and triumph) than they. <h2><u><b>5—18.]</u></h2></b> <i>Proof from Scripture of this last declaration.</i><h2><u><b>5.]</u></h2></b> <b>For</b> (substantiation of His having inherited a more exalted name than the angels) <b>to whom of</b> (among) <b>the angels did He</b> (God, the subject of vv. 1,2; as the subsequent citation shews) <b>ever say</b> (this citation from Ps. ii. has brought up in recent German Commentators the whole question of the original reference of that Psalm, and of Old Test. citations in the New Test. altogether. These discussions will be found in Bleek, De Wette, and Ebrard. The latter is by far the deepest and most satisfactory: seeing, as he does, the furthest into the truth of the peculiar standing of the Hebrew people, and the Messianic import of the theocracy. Those who entirely or partially deny this latter, seem to me to be without adequate means of discussing the question. Ebrard’s view is, that the Psalm belongs to the reign of David. The objection that ver. 6 will not apply to David’s anointing, inasmuch as that took place at Bethlehem in his boyhood, he answers, by regarding that anointing as connected with his establishment on Mount Zion, not as having locally taken place there, but as the first of that series of divine mercies of which that other was the completion. He further ascribes the Psalm to that portion of David’s reign when (2 Sam. viii.) Hadadezer, and many neighbouring nations, were smitten by him: which victories he looked on as the fulfilment to him of Nathan’s prophecy, 2 Sam. vii, 8–17. In that prophecy the offspring of David is mentioned in the very words quoted below in this verse, and in terms which, he contends, will not apply to Solomon, but must be referred to the great promised Seed of David. He regards this triumphant. occasion as having been trented by the royal Psalmist as a type and foretaste of the ultimate ideal dominion of the “Son of David” over the kings of the earth), <b>Thou</b> (the seed of David, anointed in God’s counsels as king on his holy hill of Sion : see above) <b>art my Son</b> (according; to the promise presently to be quoted, finding its partial fulfilment in Solomon, but its only entire one in the Son of David who is also the Son of God), <b>I</b> (emphatic : “I and no other:” expressed also in the Hebrew) <b>this day have begotten thee</b> (first, what are we to understand by this term, <b>have begotten</b>? Bleck says, “As Sonship, in the proper sense, is dependent on the act of begetting, so may, especially by the Hebrews, ‘to beget’ be figuratively used to express the idea of ‘making any one a son,’ in which derived and figurative reference this also may be meant. And we get an additional confirmation of this meaning from Jer ii. 27, where it is said of the foolish idolatrous Israelites, ‘They say to a stock, Thou art my father, and to a ‘stone, Thou hast begotten me’ (so the Septuagint). Accordingly, the meaning here is,—’I have made Thee my Son’ [so Ps. lxxxix. 20, 26, 27: ‘I have found David my servants with my holy oil have I anointed him: ....

Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth’]:—namely, by setting Thee on the throne of my people: and the term <b>this day</b> will most naturally be referred to the time of the anointing of the King on Zion, as the act whereby he was manifested as Son of God in this sense.” And so Calvin. The above remarks seem pertinent and unobjectionable, as long as we regard them as explaining the supposed immediate reference to David and present circumstances: but it is plain that, according to the above view of Ps. ii., and indeed to the usage of the New Test., in applying this passage to our Lord, we want another and a higher sense in which both the words, <b>I have begotten,</b> and <b>this day,</b> may be applicable to Him : a sense in which I should be disposed to say that the words must in their fulness of meaning be taken, to the neglect and almost the obliteration of that their supposed lower reference. For, granting the application of such sayings to our Lord, then must the terms of them, suggested by the Holy Spirit of prophecy, which is His testimony, bear adequate interpretations as regards His person and office. It has not therefore been without reason that the Fathers, and so many modern divines, have found in this term <b>I have begotten</b> the doctrine of the generation of the Son of God, and have endeavoured, in accordance with such reference, to assign a fitting sense to <b>this day</b>. As the subject is exceedingly important, and has been generally passed over slightly by our English expositors, I shall need no apology for gathering from Bleck and Snuicer the opinions and testimonies concerning it. 1) One view refers <b>this day</b> to the eternal generation of the Son, and regards it as an expression of the everlasting <i>present</i> of eternity. Thus Origen very grandly says, “This is said to Him by God, with whom ‘to-day’ ever is present: for with God, as I think, is no evening, because neither is there morning, but the time which reaches, so to speak, over His unbegotten and eternal life, is an everlasting ‘to-day,’ in which the Son is begotten: no beginning of His being begotten being found, as neither of this ‘to-day.’” And so Athanasius, Augustine, and other Fathers and moderns. 2) A second, to the generation, <i>in time,</i> of the Incarnate Son of Man, when Jesus assumed the divine nature on the side of his <i>Manhood also:</i> so Chrysostom, Theodoret, Eusebius, Cyril Alex., and others. 3) A third, to the period when Jesus was manifested to men as the Son of God, i.e. by most, to the time of the Resurrection, with reference to Acts xiii. 33, where St. Paul alleges this citation as thus applying [so, recently, Delitzsch]: by some, to that of the Ascension, when He was set at the right hand of God and entered on His heavenly High Priesthood [ch. v. 5]: so Hilary, Ambrose, Calvin, Grotius, and the Socinians. Owen also takes the same view [“the eternal generation of Christ, on which His filiation or sonship, both name and thing, doth depend, is to be taken only declaratively, and that declaration to be made in His resurrection, and exaltation over all, that ensued thereon”]. Of these interpretations, I agree with Bleck that the <i>first</i> is that which best agrees with the context. The former verses represent to us the Son of God as standing in this relation to the Father before the worlds: and ver. 6, which plainly forms a contrast to this ver. 5 as to time, treats distinctly of the period of the Incarnation. It is natural then to suppose that this verse is to be referred to a time prior to that event) ? <b>And again</b> (how is the ellipsis here to be supplied? Probably, <b>and</b> [<i>to whom of the angels ever said He</i>] <b>again</b>: or perhaps, <b>again</b> [see below on ver. 6] merely serves to introduce a fresh citation), <b>I will be to Him as</b> (for) <b>a father, and he shall be to me as</b> (for) <b>a son</b> (the citation is from the Septuagint, as usual. It occurs in the prophecy of Nathan to David respecting David's offspring who should come after him. The import of it has been above considered, and its connexion with Ps. ii. shown to be probable. The direct primary reference of the words to Solomon, 1 Chron. xxii. 7–10, does not in any way preclude the view which I have there taken of their finding their higher and only worthy fulfilment in the greater Son of David, who should build the only Temple in which God would really dwell)?<h2><u><b>6.]</u></h2> But</b> (because a further proof, and a more decisive one as regards the angels, is about to be adduced) <b>when He again</b> (or, <i>“when again He?”</i> Does <b>again</b> introduce a new citation, or does it belong to the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-YGRFq-3a0KbK46Oxfqb80lTHfnWzDSM/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This latter view is taken by many, principally the ancient expositors, and lately by Tholuck, De Wette, Lünemann, and Delitzsch,—interpreting the ‘second introduction’ diversely: some, as His incarnation, contrasted with His everlasting generation, or His creating of the world, which they treat as His first introduction: others, as His resurrection, contrasted with His incarnation: others, to His second coming, as contrasted with His first. The other view supposes a transposition of the adverb <i>again,</i> which in the original stands between <i>when</i> and the verb. I have shewn in my Gr. Test. that such a transposition is without examples. In this Epistle, when <i>“again”</i> is joined to a verb, it always has the sense of <i>‘a second time:’</i> e.g. ch. iv. 7; v. 12; vi. 1, 6. This being the ease, I must agree with those who join <b>again</b> with <b>hath introduced</b>. And of the meanings which they assign to the phrase <i>“bringing in again,”</i> I conceive the only allowable one to be, the second coming of our Lord to judgment. See more below) hath (‘shall have’ It appears from all usage that the <i>present</i> rendering, <i>“bringeth in,”</i> is quite inadmissible) <b>hath introduced</b> (in what sense? See some of the interpretations above. But even those who hold the transposition of the word <b>again</b> are not, agreed as to the <i>introduction</i> here referred to. Some hold one of the above-mentioned meanings, some another. I have discussed the meaning fully below, and gathered that the word can only refer to the great entering of the Messiah on His kingdom. At present, the usage of the verb here used must be considered. It is the accustomed word in the Pentateuch for the ‘introducing’ the children of Israel into the lund of promise, the putting them into possession of their promised inheritance : see also Ps. lxxviii. 54. We have it again in Neh. i. 9, of the second introduction, or restoration of Israel to the promised land. The prophets again use it of the ultimate restoration of Israel : compare Isa. xiv. 2; lvi. 7; Jer. iii.14; Ezek. xxxiv. 13; xxxvi. 24; xxxvii. 21; Zech. viii. 8. This fact, connected with the circumstances to be noted below, makes it probable that the word here also has this solemn sense of ‘putting in possession of,’ as of an inheritance. The sense ordinarily given, of ‘bringing into the world,’ the act of the Father corresponding to the <i>“coming into the world”</i> [ch. x. 5] of the Son appears to be unexampled) <b>the firstborn</b> (only here is the Son of God so called absolutely. It is His title by præ-existence, <i>“the </i><b>firstborn</b><i> of all creation,”</i> Col. i. 15 [where see the word itself discussed]:—by prophecy, Ps, lxxxix. 27, <i>“I will make Him my </i><b>firstborn,</b><i> higher than the kings of the earth:”</i> —by birth, Luke ii. 7, see also Matt. i, 18–25:—by victory over death, Col. i. 18; Rev. i. 5:—and here, where He is absolutely <b>the Firstborn,</b> it will he reasonable to regard all these references as being accumulated — Him, who is <i>the Firstborn,</i>—of the universe, of the new manhood, of the risen dead. And thus the inducting Him in glory into His inheritance is clothed with even more solemnity. All angels, all men, are but the younger sons of God, compared to HIM, THE FIRSTBORN) <b>into the world</b> (not the same word as that so rendered, ch. x. 5: but signifying the ‘inhabited earth:’ and very frequently used by the Septuagint in prophetic passages, where the future judgments of God on mankind are spoken of. The usage would not indeed be decisive against referring the words to Christ’s entrance into the human nature, but is much more naturally satisfied by the other interpretation), <b>He</b> (i.e. God, the subject of ver. 5) <b>saith, And let all the angels of God worship Him</b> (there are two places from which these words might come; and the comparison of the two will be very instructive as to the connexion and citation of prophecy. 1) The words themselves, including the <b>and</b>, which has no independent meaning here, come from Deut. xxxii. 43, where they conclude the dying song of Moses with a triumphant description of the victory of God over His enemies, and the avenging of His people. It will cause the intelligent student of Scripture no surprise to find such words cited directly of Christ, into whose hand all judgment is committed: however such Commentators as Stuart and De Wette may reject the idea of the citation being from thence, because no trace of a Messianic reference is there found.

But those who see not Christ every where in the Old Testament, see Him nowhere. The fact of the usual literal citation of the Septuagint by our Writer, decides the point as far as the place is concerned from which the words are immediately taken. But here a difficulty arises. The words in the Septuagint, Deut. xxxii. 43, <i>“Rejoice ye heavens, with Him, and let all the angels of God worship Him,”</i> do not exist in our present Hebrew text. It is hardly however probable, that they are an insertion of the Septuagint, found as they are [with one variation presently to be noticed] in nearly all the MSS. The translators probably found them in their Hebrew text, which, especially in the Pentateuch, appears to have been an older and purer recension than that which we now possess. 2) The other passage from which they might come is Ps. xcvi. 7, where however they do not occur verbatim, but we read, “worship Him, all ye angels of God.” This, especially the omission of the and, which clearly belongs to the citation, is against the supposition of their being taken from thence: but it does not therefore follow that the Psalm was not in the Sacred Writer’s mind, or does not apply to the same glorious period of Messiah's triumph in its ultimate reference. Indeed the similarity of the two expressions of triumph is remarkable). <h2><u><b>7.]</u></h2> And</b> (with reference) <b>indeed to the angels He</b> (God) <b>saith, Who maketh his angels winds</b> (see below), <b>and his ministers a flame of fire</b> (the citation is after the Septuagint according to the Alexandrine MS., which indeed commonly agrees with the citations in this Epistle. And as the words stand in the Greek, the arrangement and rendering of them is unquestionably as above. But here comes in no small difficulty as to the sense of the original Hebrew. It is usually contended that its words can only mean, from the context, “who maketh the winds his messengers, and flames of fire his servants.” But I have maintained in my Greek Test. that the sense is, “who maketh his messengers winds, his servants flames of fire,” whatever these words may be intended to import. And this latter enquiry will I imagine be not very difficult to answer. He makes his messengers winds, i.e. He causes his messengers to act in or by means of the winds; his servants flames of fire, i.e. commissions them to assume the agency or form of flames for His purposes. Tt seems to me that this, the plain sense of the Hebrew as it stands, is quite as agreeable to the context as the other. And thus the Rabbis took it. The only accommodation of the original passage made by the Writer, is the very slight one of applying the general terms “His messengers” and “His servants” to the angels, which indeed can be their only meaning. The sense of the words I have endeavoured to give in some measure above. It is evident that the word represented in the A. V. by <i>spirits,</i> must be rendered <b>winds,</b> not <i>‘spirits:’</i> from both the context in the Psalm and the correspondence of the two clauses, and also from the nature of the subject. “They all <i>are</i> spirits,” as asserted below, ver. 14: therefore it could not with any meaning be said, that He <i>maketh them</i> spirits). <b>But unto the Son,— Thy throne, O God, [is] for ever and ever: and the rod</b> (i.e. sceptre: see especially Esth. iv. 11; Amos i. 5, where the same Hebrew word occurs) <b>of thy kingdom is the rod of straightness</b> (i.e. righteousness, justice). <b>Thou lovedst</b> (the Writer refers the words to the whole life of our Lord on earth, as a past period) <b>righteousness, and hatedst iniquity; for this cause</b> (because of His love of righteousness and hatred of iniquity, shewn by his blameless life and perfect obedience on earth)<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H7ebfc1NwjWl1xFF72TDIqBveTzcjSXh/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For it is a consequent upon the righteous course of the Son of God in his Humanity, and therefore belongs to his triumph, in which He is exalted above his fellows [see below]. Again, the <i>“oil of gladness”</i> below seems rather to point to a festive and triumphant, than to an inaugurative unction. We should therefore rather take the allusion to be, as in Ps. xxiii. 5; xcii. 10, to the custom of anointing guests at feasts: so that, as the King in the Psalm is anointed with the oil of rejoicing above his fellows, because of his having loved righteousness and hated iniquity, so Christ, in the jubilant celebration of His finished course at his exaltation in heaven, is anointed with the festive oil <i>above His fellows</i> [see below]. There is of course an allusion also in the word <b>anointed</b> (echrīsen) to the honoured and triumphant. Name <i>Christ</i>) <b>with oil of rejoicing</b> (see above: oil indicative of joy, as it is of superabundance: compare Isa. lxi. 3) <b>beyond thy fellows</b> (i.e. in the Psalm, ‘other kings:’ hardly ‘brothers by kin’ [other sons of David], as Grotius and others. But to whom does the Writer apply the words? Chrysostom says, “Who are the <i>fellows,</i> except <i>men?</i> And the meaning is, Christ received not the Holy Spirit by measure.” Theodoret on the Psalm, Calvin, Beza, and others, think of believers, the adopted into God’s family : others, of the High Priests, prophets, and kings, in the Old Test., anointed as types of Christ: others, of <i>all creatures:</i> others, as in the Psalm, of <i>other kings.</i> Camero says, “Christ had in His office no fellows ; in His human nature, all men ; in grace, all the faithful.” Still we may answer to all these, that they do not in any way satisfy the requirements of the context. Were it the intent of the Writer to shew Christ’s superiority over his human brethren of <i>every kind,</i> we might accept one or other of these meanings: but as this is not his design, but to shew His superiority to the angels, we must I think take the word <b>fellows</b> as representing other heavenly beings, partakers in the same glorious and sinless state with Himself, though not in the strict sense, His “fellows.” De Wette objects to this sense, that the Writer places the angels far beneath Christ: Delitzsch, that the angels are not <i>anointed,</i> whereas there is no necessity in the text for understanding that these <i>fellows</i> are also anointed: the comparison may consist in the very fact of the anointing itself:— and Ebrard, speaking as usual strongly, says that “neither the Psalmist, nor our author if in his senses, could have applied the word to the angels.” But this need not frighten us: and we may well answer with Lünemann, 1) “that the general comparison here being that of Christ with the angels, the fresh introduction of this point of comparison in ver. 9 cannot of itself appear inappropriate. 2) Granted, that just before, in ver. 7, the angels are placed far beneath Christ,—we have this very inferiority here marked distinctly by the terms of this comparison. 3) The angels are <i>next</i> to Christ in rank, by the whole course of this argument: to whom then would the Writer more naturally apply the term <i>fellows,</i> than to them?” I may add, 4) that the comparison here is but analogous to that in ver. 4, of which indeed it is an expansion: and 5) that thus only can the figure of anointing at a triumphant festival be carried out consistently: that triumph having taken place on the exaltation of the Redeemer to the Father’s right hand and throne [ver. 8], when, the whole of the heavenly company, His <i>fellows</i> in glory and joy, being anointed with the oil of gladness, His share and dignity was so much greater than theirs. It remains that we should consider the general import, and application here, of Ps. xlv. From what is elsewhere found in this commentary, it will not be for a moment supposed that I can give in to the view of such writers as De Wette and Hupfeld, who maintain that it was simply an ode to some king, uncertain whom, and has no further reference whatever.

Thus considered, such applications as this lose all their difficulty; and we cease to feel ourselves obliged in every case to enquire to whom and on what occasion the Psalm was probably first addressed. And even descending to the low and mere rationalistic ground taken by De Wette and Hupfeld, we are at least safer than they are, holding as we do a meaning in which both Jews and Christians have so long concurred, as against the infinite diversity of occasion and reference which divides their opinions of the Psalm).<h2><u><b>10.]</u></h2> And</b> (<i>He saith to the Son: </i>see a similar <i>And</i> introducing a new citation in Acts i. 20.

But it is taken up from <i>“O my God”</i> in ver. 24; and indeed from the whole strain of address, in which <i>Jehovah</i> has been thrice expressed; in vv.1,12,15. On the bearing and interpretation of the Psalm, see below), <b>foundedst the earth; and the heavens are works of thine hands</b> (see Ps. viii. 3): <h2><u><b>11.]</u></h2> they</b> (seems most naturally to refer to <i>the heavens</i> immediately preceding. There is no reason in the Psalm why the pronoun should not represent both antecedents, the heavens and the earth. Here, however, the subsequent context seems to determine the application to be only to the heavens: for to them only can be referred the following image, <i>“as a vesture shalt thou fold thein up”</i>) <b>shall perish</b> (as far as concerns their present state. Compare the parallel expression, <i>“shall be changed,”</i> below); <b>but thou remainest</b> (Bleck prefers the future, on the ground of the verbs being all future in the Hebrew text. But perhaps the consideration alleged by Lümemann, that the Writer, using only the Septuagint, seems to place <i>“but thou remainest”</i> and <i>“but thou art the same,”</i> as parallel clauses, is of more weight than the other. De Wette, on the Psalm, renders the Hebrew verbs <i>present.</i> The verb in the original is a compound one, giving the sense of endurance through all changes); <b>and they all shall wax old as a garment </b>(see Isa. li. 6, <i>“The earth shall wax old like a garment:”</i> also Isa. l. 9; and Ecclus. xiv. 17); <b>and as a mantle</b> (the word signifies any enveloping, enwrapping garment) <b>shalt thou fold them up</b> (the Hebrew here, and apparently some copies of the Septuagint, have the same verb as below: <i>“thou shalt change them,”</i>— “thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed.” But the Alexandrine MS. reads as our text: and there can be little doubt that the Writer of this Epistle followed that text as usual), <b>and they shall be changed</b> (viz. as a mantle is folded up to be put away when a fresh one is about to be put on): <b>but thou art the same</b> (Hebrew, “and Thou art He:” viz., He, which thou hast ever been: compare Isa. xlvi. 4), <b>and thy years shall not fail</b> (Hebrew, “Thy years end not,” are never completed.

And the trust of Israel in this her Deliverer was ever directed to the comfort of her sons under the immediate trouble of the time, be that what it might. As generations went on, more and more was revealed of the Messiah’s office and work, and the hearts of God’s people entered deeper and deeper into the consolation to be derived from the hope of His coming. Here then we have this sorrowing one casting himself on the mercy of the great Deliverer, and extolling his faithfulness and firmness over, and as distinguished from, all the works of His hands. To apply then these words to the Redeemer, is to use them in their sense of strictest propriety).<h2><u><b>13.]</u></h2> But</b> (the contrast is again taken up from ver, 8) <b>to whom of the angels hath He </b>(God, as before) <b>ever said, Sit thou on my right hand until I place thine enemies </b>(as)<b> a footstool</b> (the allusion is to the custom of putting the feet on the necks of conquered enemies, see Josh. x. 24f.) <b>of thy feet?</b> Hardly any Psalm is so often quoted in the New Test. with reference to Christ, as Ps. cx. And no Psalm more clearly finds its ultimate reference and completion only in Christ, as even those confess, who question its being immediately addressed to Him at first: and regard the argument of our Lord to the Pharisees founded on this place, as merely one grounded on concession on both sides. On the theocratic principle of interpretation, there is not the slightest difficulty in the application of the words directly to Him who is (and was ever regarded, even in David’s time) Israel’s King, the Head and Chief of the theocracy. <br><br>And see this further carried out in the note on ch. v. 6.<h2><u><b>14.]</u></h2> Are they not all</b> (all the angels) <b>ministering </b>(in reference probably to the word <i>“ministers”</i> in ver. 7. The word, signifying <i>“pertaining to the ministry,”</i> is used in the Septuagint of any thing pertaining to the <i>ministers</i> or their service; the instruments, vessels, garments, or offerings for the ministry: here, of those devoted to or belonging to the ministry of God) <b>spirits</b> (unembodied beings, even as God Himself, but distinguished by the epithet <i>presiding.</i> The idea of “angels of service” or “of the ministry,” is familiar to the rabbis), <b>sent forth</b> (it is the <i>present participle,</i> so also in Rev. v. 6: he does not mean that angels have before now, in insulated cases, been sent forth, but that they are ever thus being sent forth,—it is their normal work and regular duty through all the ages of time) <b>for ministry</b> (in order to the ministration which is their work. The A. V., “sent forth to minister for them,” gives a wrong idea of the meaning. The <i>ministry</i> is not a <i>waiting upon men,</i> but a fulfilment of their office as <i>ministers of God.</i> See Rom. xiii. 4. Compare with this expression Col.i.7, <i>“a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf”</i>) <b>on behalf of those who are about to inherit salvation</b> (in the highest sense—eternal salvation: not, as Kuinoel and others, “deliverance from dangers:” in so solemn a reference, that meaning would be quite beside the purpose. Those spoken of are the elect of God, they who love Him, and for whom all things work together for good, even the principalities and powers in heavenly places. And if it be said, that the ministration of angels has often been used for other immediate purposes than the behoof of the elect, we may answer, that all those things may well come under the <i>ministry,</i> on account of <i>them who shall be heirs of salvation</i>: for all things are theirs; and for them, in and as united to Christ, all events are ordered)? Thus the Son of God is proved superior to the angels—i.e. to the highest. of created beings: who, so far from being equal with Him, worship Him, and serve His purposes.<h1><u><b>CHAP.

We, going onward in time, living our lives in one or another direction, are exhorted ‘to adhere to the things we have heard’ [see above], and that, <i>‘that we do not at any time float past them,’</i> be not carried away beside them, led astray from the course on which they would take us. Two mistakes respecting the word are to be avoided: a) that of A. V., <i>‘lest at any time we should let them slip.’</i> From what has been above said of the tense and voice, it will be clear that such cannot be the meaning. b) Still worse is that of those who have thought of a comparison with a sieve, or a leaking vessel. So Calvin, Owen, and others: and I find it reproduced in Tait’s commentary on the He- brews: <i>“lest.... we should run out as leaking vessels.”</i> The meaning is as untenable, as the simile is irrelevant.

It has been sometimes supposed that the <b>angels</b> spoken of here are not angels, but merely human messengers.

I should be disposed to think, to the former: such penalties as are denounced in Deut. xxxii. 35, and indeed attached to very many of the Mosaic enactments: as Owen: “The law was so established, that the transgression of it, so as to disannul the terms and conditions of it, had by divine constitution the punishment of death temporal, or excision, appointed unto it”);<h2><u><b>3.]</u></h2> how shall we</b> (emphatic: including Christians in general, all who have received the message of salvation in the manner specified below) <b>escape, if we have neglected so great </b>(“<i>that</i> was a giving of laws only, but the other brought the grace of the Spirit, and the taking away of sins, and the announcement of the kingdom of heaven, and the promise of immortality: so that he had some reason to say <b>so great</b>.” Theodore of Mopsuestia) <b>salvation</b> (as in ch. i. 14); <b>the which</b> (equivalent to <i>‘seeing that it’</i>), <b>having begun to be spoken by means of</b> (he was the instrument in this ease, as the angels in the other; but both, law and gospel, came at first hand not from the mediators, but from God) <b>the Lord (by the Lord</b> is to be joined with the whole, <b>having began to be spoken,</b> not with <b>spoken</b> only. <b>The Lord,</b> as Bleck remarks, has here an especial emphasis setting forth the majesty and sovereignty of Christ: “He Himself, the Master of angels, first brought to us the doctrine of salvation,” Theodoret), <b>was confirmed</b> (see Mark xvi. 19, where the word is used exactly in the same sense and reference.

On the other hand, a <b>sign</b> is each and every thing whereby a person, or a saying and assertion, is witnessed to as true, and made manifest: and thus it <i>may</i> be something, which, considered in and of itself, would appear an ordinary matter, causing no astonishment, but which gets its character of striking and supernatural from the connexion into which it is brought with something else, e.g. from a heavenly messenger having previously referred to some event which he could not have foreseen by mere natural knowledge. But it may also be a <i>wonder,</i> properly so called.

It seems much more natural to refer this pronoun to God, the primary subject of the sentence, than to the Holy, who is merely introduced in the course of it. And if it be once granted that <b>His</b> refers to God, we should have, on the supposition of the <i>subjective</i> genitive an awkwardly complicated sense, hardly consistent with the assertion of absolute sovereignty so prominently made in the following clause. I take then the genitive, with most commentators, as <i>objective,</i> and the Holy Spirit as that which <i>is distributed, </i>according to God’s will, to each man according to his measure and kind. The declaration in John iii. 34, of Him whom God sent, <i>“He giveth not the Spirit by measure,”</i> speaks of the same <i>giving,</i> but of its unmeasured fulness, as imparted to our glorious Head, not of its fragmentary distribution to us, the imperfect and limited members), <b>according to His</b> (God’s: see above) <b>will</b> (it is best to refer this clause, not to the whole sentence preceding, nor to the two clauses, <i>various miraculous powers</i> and <i>distributions of the Holy Spirit,</i> as Bleek and Lünemann, but to the last of these only, agreeably to 1 Cor. xii. 11, and to the free and sovereign agency implied in the word <i>distributions</i>.

V., “according to the number of the children [more properly, <i>the sons</i>, in the stricter sense] of Israel.” Origen (or his translator) says, “According to the number of His angels, or, as we read in other copies, according to the number of the sons of Israel.” But the <i>doctrine </i>rests on passages about which there can be no such doubt. See Dan. x. 13, 20, 21; xii. 1, for this commital of kingdoms to the superintendence of angels: Rev. ix. 11; xvi. 5, for the same as regards<br><br><br><br>the natural elements: Matt. xviii. 10, as regards the guardianship of individuals: Rev. i. 20 &c., for that of churches [for so, and not of chief bishops, is the name to be understood: see note there]. See also Dan. iv. 13. In the apocryphal and rabbinical writings we find the same idea asserted, and indeed carried out into minute details. So in Ecclus. xvii. 17, <i>“In the division of the nations of the whole earth he set a ruler over every people: but Israel is the Lord’s portion.”</i> The rabbinical authorities may be found in Bleck and Eisenmenger. See also a very elaborate article—“Engel”—by Böhme, in Herzog’s Encyclȯpädie: and testimonies to the view of the early church from Eusebius, Justin Martyr, Irenæus, Athenagoras, and Clement of Alexandria, in Whitby’s note. The idea then of subjection of the world to angels was one with which the readers of this Epistle were familiar) <b>the world</b> <b>to come</b> (the reference of this expression has been variously given by expositors. 1) Many imagine it to refer to the world which is, strictly speaking, <i>to come,</i> as distinguished from this present world. This meaning will hardly tally with the context here. Though it might be said that the future life, being the <i>completion</i> of the state of salvation by Christ, might very well here he spoken of as the subject of the present discourse. 2) Some have supposed a direct allusion to ch. i. 6. But certainly in this case the verb would have been past: “of which we <i>spoke;”</i> and besides, the addition of the epithet to come sufficiently distinguishes it from the mere inhabited world, in the other place. 3) Others again have thought of <i>heaven</i>, which is to us future, because we are not yet admitted to its joys, But this again would not agree with the context. 4) The most probable account to be given is that the phrase represents the Hebrew expression, <i>“the age to come”</i> [see note on ch. i. 1], and imports the whole new order of things brought in by Christ,—taking its rise in His life on earth, and having its completion in His reign in glory. This last-mentioned view is by far the best, agreeing as it does with the connexion, for he has been speaking of the gospel above, with the ordinary way of speaking, and with the whole subject of the Epistle. <i>All</i> reference to the future need not be excluded: we Christians are so eminently “prisoners of hope,” that the very mention of such a designation would naturally awaken a thought of the glories to come: but this reference must not be pressed as having any prominence), <b>of which we are speaking</b> (which forms the subject of our present argument: viz. that urged in vv. 1–4, The sense is strictly <i>present;</i> not past, nor future. Bleek has here some excellent remarks: “As regards the whole thought, the non-subjection of the new order of the world to angels, it respects partly what is already present, partly what we have yet to wait for. Certainly, here and there in the New Test. history angels are mentioned: but they come in only as transitory appearances, to announce or to execute some matter which is specially entrusted to them: they never appear as essential agents in the introduction of the kingdom of God, either in general, or in particular: they do not descend on earth as preaching repentance, or preparing men to be received into God’s kingdom. This is done by <i>men</i>, first and chiefly by Him who is Son of Man <i>par excellence</i>, and after Him by the disciples whom He prepared for the work. Even the miraculous conversion of Paul is brought about, not by angels, but by the appearing of the Lord Himself. Our author has indeed, in ch. i. 14, designated the angels as fellow-workers in the salvation of men: but only in a serving capacity, never as working or imparting salvation by independent agency, as does the Son of Man in the first place, and then in a certain degree His disciples also. So that we cannot speak with any truth of a subjection of this new order of things to the angels, Rather, even by what we see at present, does it appear to be subjected to the Redeemer Himself.

Thus, by reminding them of the will of God declared in the holy Scriptures, does the Writer meet at the same time the objections of those of his readers and countrymen, to whom perhaps withdrawal of the agency of the angels with the introduction and growing realization of the new order of things might appear an important defect”). <h2><u><b>6.]</u></h2> But </b>(introduces a contrast to a preceding negative sentence frequently in our Epistle: compare ch. iv, 13. 15; ix. 12; x. 27; xii. 13. An ellipsis follows it, to be supplied in the thought, “it is far otherwise, for” ....) <b>one somewhere</b> (no inference can be drawn from this indefinite manner of citation, either that the writer was quoting from memory, as some think, or that he did not know who was the author of the Psalm, as others. Rather may we say that it shews he was writing for readers familiar with the Scriptures, and from whom it might well be expected that they would recognize the citation without further specification. He certainly is not quoting from memory, seeing that the words agree exactly with the Septuagint: and Ps. viii. both in the Hebrew and Septuagint has a superscription indicating that it was written by David. We can hardly infer with some that the Writer meant to express his feeling that the Old Test. books had no human authors, but God Himself: for in this ease the personal designation <i>some one</i> would hardly have been used, but a passive construction, <i>“it is written,”</i> or the like, adopted instead) <b>testified, saying</b> (this seems the proper place for a few remarks on the sense of the citation which follows, and on the connexion of thought in the rest of the chapter. The general import of the <i>eighth Psalm</i> may be described as being, to praise Jehovah for His glory and majesty, and His merciful dealing with and exaltation of mankind. All exposition which loses sight of this general import, and attempts to force the Psalm into a direct and exclusive prophecy of the personal Messiah, goes to conceal its true prophetic sense, and to obscure the force and beauty of its reference to Him. This has been done by Bleck and others, who have made “the Son of Man” a direct title here of Christ. It is MAN who in the Psalm is spoken of, in the common and most general sense: the care taken by God of <i>Him,</i> the lordship given to <i>him</i>, the subjection of God’s works to him. This high dignity he lost, but this high dignity he has regained, and possesses potentially in all its fulness and glory, restored, and for ever secured to him: How? and by whom? By one of his own race, the MAN Christ Jesus. Whatever high and glorious things can be said of man, belong <i>of proper right</i> to Him only, <i>in proper person</i> to Him only, but derivatively to us His brethren and members. And this is the great key to the interpretation of all such sayings as these: whatever belongs to man by the constitution of his nature, belongs superlatively to that MAN, who is the constituted HEAD of man’s nature, the second Adam, who has more than recovered all that the first Adam lost. To those who clearly apprehend and firmly hold this fundamental doctrine of Christianity, the interpretation of ancient prophecy, and the New Test. application of Old Test. sayings to Christ, become a far simpler matter than they ever can be to others. And so here, it is to MAN, not to angels, that the “world to come” is subjected. This is the argument: and, as far as the end of ver. 8, it is carried on with reference to <i>man</i>, properly so called. There is <i>here</i> as yet no personal reference to our Lord, who is first introduced, and that in His lower personal human Name, at ver. 9. This has been missed, and thus confusion introduced into the argument, by the majority of Commentators. To hold that our Lord is from the first intended by <i>“man”</i> and <i>“the son of man”</i> here, is to disturb altogether the logical sequence, which runs thus: “It is <i>not to angels</i> that He has subjected the latter dispensation, but to <i>man</i>. Still we do not see man in possession of this sovereignty. No; but we do see Jesus, whose humiliation fulfilled the conditions of manhood, crowned with glory and honour, and thus constituted the Head of our race, so that His death and sufferings were our deliverance and our perfecting. And for this to be so, the sanctifier and the sanctified must be all of one race.” And the rest of the chapter is spent in laying forth with inimitable beauty and tenderness tho<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzkF2FN6mVAnR1NtqU4iwA6ltQ2IsSrp/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The whole process of this second chapter stands without parallel for tender persuasiveness amidst the strictest logical coherence. And yet both of these are concealed and spoiled, unless we take these words of the Psalm, and the argument founded on them, of man generally, and then, and not till then, of Jesus, as man like ourselves), <b>What is man</b> (some have understood this to mean, “How great, how noble, is man; who even amongst the immensity of all these heavenly works of God, yet is remembered and visited of Him;” but against this are the two words here used in the Hebrew, both betokening man on his lower side, of weakness and inferiority. There can be little doubt that the ordinary view is right—not<i> how great,</i> but <i>how little,</i> is man. This agrees far better also with the wonder expressed at God’s thinking of and visiting him, below), <b>that thou art mindful of him</b> (i.e. objectively,—as shewn by Thy care of him)? or (in the Hebrew <i>“and”</i> is here doubtless substituted for <b>or</b> by the Septuagint, to indicate that the second member of the parallelism does not point to another subject additional to the first) <b>the son of man</b> (proceeding on the same view as that given above, it would be irrelevant here to enter on an enquiry as to the application of this title to our Lord, by others, and by Himself,— inasmuch as it is not here appropriated to Him, but used of any and every son of Adam. It is true, our thoughts at once recur to Him on reading the words—but, if we are following the train of thought, only as their ulterior, not as their immediate, reference), <b>that Thou visitest him?</b><h2><u><b>7.]</u></h2> Thou madest Him a little lower than the angels </b>(literally, in the Hebrew, “Thou lettest him be little inferior to God.” The best Hebrew scholars seem to agree that the word “God” here represents not the personal God, but the abstract qualities of Godhead, in which all that is divine, or immediately connected with the Deity, is included. If so, then the rendering of the Septuagint and our text is, though not exhaustive of the original, yet by no means an inaccurate one. The angelic nature, being the lowest of that which is divine and heavenly, marks well the terminus just beneath which man is set. And it must be remarked that the stress of the argument here is not on this mention of the angels, but on the assertion of the sovereignty of man. I may remark, that the marginal rendering of our A. V., <i>“a little while inferior to,”</i> though doubtless also warranted by the usage of the Greek, seems quite unnecessary in the context, where not the question of <i>time</i>, but that of place, is before us); <b>thou crownedst him with glory and honour</b> (I must remind the reader of what has been said before; that the quotation is adduced <i>here</i> not of the Messiah, but of <i>man</i>, and that on this the whole subsequent argument depends. With this view vanish the difficulties which have been raised about the original and here-intended meaning of this clause. It is, in fact, a further setting forth of the preceding one. Man, who was left not far behind the divine attributes themselves, was also invested with kingly majesty on earth, put into the place of God Himself in sovereignty over the world. That this has only been realized in the man Christ Jesus, is not brought out till below, and forms the central point of the argument. Hupfeld remarks that the Hebrew term here rendered <b>glory and honour</b>, is a common expression for the divine majesty, and thence for the kingly, as a reflexion of the divine: and the crowning represents the kingly majesty, with which man is adorned as with a kingly crown): <h2><u><b>8.]</u></h2> thou didst put all things under his feet </b>(universal dominion is bestowed on man by his constitution as he came from God. That that bestowal has never yet been realized, is the next step of the argument: the Redeemer being at present kept out of sight, but by and by to be introduced as the real fulfiller of this high destiny of man, and on that account, incarnate in man’s nature).<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpLqf0VyoOtNOSIJog7JT1PlI-H6K8Of/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The idea that angels are especially here intended, has arisen from that misconception of the connexion, which I have been. throughout endeavouring to meet) <b>unsubjected to him</b>. <b>But</b> (contrast: bringing out the exception) <b>now</b> (in the present condition of things: not strictly temporal, but as <i>“now”</i> ch. xi. 16, and ch. ix, 26) <b>we see not yet</b> (compare on the whole, 1 Cor. xv. 24–27) <b>all things </b>(<i>the universe again</i>) <b>put under him</b> (the word <b>him</b> in all three places referring to MAN : <i>man</i> has not yet attained his sovereign. That the summing up of manhood in Christ is in the Writer’s mind, is evident throughout, and that he wishes it to be before his readers’ minds also; but the gradual introduction of the humiliation exaltation of Christ in His humanity is marred by making all this apply personally to Him. Manhood, as such, is exalted to glory and honour, and waiting for its primæval prerogative to be fully assured, but it is IN CHRIST, and in Him alone, that this is true: and in Him it is true, inasmuch as He, being of our flesh and blood, and having been Himself made perfect by suffering, and calling us His brethren, can lead us up through sufferings into glory, freed from guilt by His sacrifice for our sins).<h2><u><b>9.]</u></h2></b> We do not see man, &c. <b>But</b> (strong contrast again: <i>“but rather”</i>—see on ver. 6) <b>him who is made </b>(better than <i>‘was,’</i> or <i>‘hath been, made;’</i> His humanity in its abstract position being in view) <b>a little </b>(not necessarily, here either, of time [a little while]: nor are we at liberty to assume such a rendering: though of course it is difficult to say, when the same phrase has two analogous meanings both applicable, as this, how far the one may have accompanied the other in the Writer’s mind)<b> lower than (the) angels, we behold </b>(notice the difference between the half-involuntary words <i>“we see”</i> above, the impression which our eyes receive from things around us,—and the direction and intention of the contemplating eye [here, of faith: ch. iii. 19; x. 25] in this word, <b>we behold), (namely) Jesus, on account of his suffering of death</b> (it has been much doubted whether these words belong (I.) to the foregoing clause, <i>“made a little lower than the angels,”</i> or, (II.) to the following, <i>“crowned with glory and honour.”</i> The former connexion is assumed without remark by the ancient Commentators, and by several moderns. And these interpret the words two ways: 1) <b>on account of the suffering of death</b> [i.e. <i>because He has</i> suffered death],—thus making <i>“a little (while)”</i> refer to the time of His sufferings and death, or, Chrysostom and others, to the three days of His being in the grave: 2) <b>for the sake of the suffering of death</b>,—so that He might suffer death. So Augustine and most of the ancients. But (II.) the latter connexion, with the following clause, is adopted by Theophylact, Luther, Calvin, and many others. The arrangement of the words, and the requirements of the context, <b>on account of the suffering of death,</b> both seem to require the latter, not the former connexion.

But emphatic they could not be in the <i>former</i> connexion, coming as they would only as an explicatory clause, after <i>“made a little lower than the angels.”</i> Again, the latter connexion entirely satisfies the context, the sufferings of Christ being treated of as necessary to His being our perfect Redeemer. And this connexion will be made even clearer by what will he said on the next clause), <b>crowned with glory and honour</b> (viz. at His exaltation, when God exalted Him to His right Hand: not, as some, at His incarnation, or His establishment as Saviour of the world: see above, ver. 7); <b>in order that</b> (how is this logically constructed? It depends on the last clause, which clause it will be best to take in its entirety, <i>“on account of His suffering of death crowned with glory and honour.”</i> The full connexion we cannot enter into, till the three other questions arising out of our clause are disposed of: <b>by the grace of God,—for every man,—and, that He should taste death) by the grace of God</b> (how is this to be understood? At all events we have strong Scripture analogy for such an expression. In Gal. ii. 21, the Apostle’s confession of faith in the Son of God, he says, <i>“I do not make void the grace of God; for if righteousness be by the law, then Christ died without cause.” </i>And in Rom. v. 8, we read, <i>“God giveth proof of His own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”</i> And in Titus ii. 11, <i>“The grace of God was manifested, bringing salvation to all men.”</i> So that, in point of meaning, no difficulty need be found in the words. It was by the love and grace, the <i>kindness</i> and <i>love towards men </i>of the Father, that all Redemption was effected, and above all that One Sacrifice which was the crowning act of Redemption. The remarkable various reading (see margin) is discussed at length in the notes to my Greek Testament. I have there concluded, that it does not seem possible to assign to the words <i>“except God,”</i> or, <i>“without God,”</i> a meaning in accordance with the demands of the context, and the analogy of Scripture. This indeed would be no argument against a reading universally and unobjectionably attested by external authorities; but where no such attestation exists, may well be brought in to guide us to a decision) <b>He might for </b>(‘on behalf of,’ ‘for the benefit of:’ where this ordinary meaning of the preposition suffices, that of vicariousness must not be introduced. Sometimes, as e.g., 2 Cor. v. 15, it is necessary. But here clearly not, the whole argument proceeding not on the vicariousness of Christ’s sacrifice, but on the benefits which we derive from His personal suffering for us in humanity; not on His substitution for us, but on His community with us) <b>every man</b> (in the original the word may be neuter or masculine; every <i>thing</i>, or every <i>man</i>. If the latter, to what is it to be referred? Origen and others take it as neuter, and apply it either to all nature, or to all reasonable beings. The latter see discussed below. The former can hardly be here meant: for of such a doctrine, however true, there is no hint. Then taking the adjective masculine, are we to understand it <i>“for every one, angels included ?”</i> So Ebrard: but where do we find any such usage of <i>“all,”</i> or <i>“every,”</i> absolutely as here? And where in this chapter again is any room for the position, that Christ suffered death for angels? In the logical course of the argument, we have done with them, and are now treating of man, and of Him who was made man to be our High Priest and advocate. And therefore of none other than man can this word <i>“every one”</i> be here meant, in accordance indeed with its universal usage elsewhere. If it be asked, why <i>every man</i> rather than <i>all men</i>, we may safely say, that the singular brings out, far more strongly than the plural would, the applicability of Christ’s death <i>to each individual man:</i> and we may say that this again testifies to the sense <i>“every man,”</i> as there would be no such reason for individualizing other rational beings, as there is for showing that the whole nature of<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/142p2Vi55gvTI_w5aGNzOLo75EEdOn_yZ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For as if really only <i>tasting</i> it, He made so little stay in it, and immediately arose:” then, comparing Christ to a physician who first tastes his medicines to encourage the sick man to take them, adds, “So also Christ, since all men had ever been afraid of death, to persuade them to be bold against it, Himself tasted it, having no benefit so to do.” So also many other Commentators, among whom Beza and Bengel find also the <i>verity</i> of His Death indicated in the words. But it is well answered, that in none of the places where the phrase appears, either in the New Test. or in the rabbinical writings, does any such meaning appear to be conveyed. Nor again can we, as Bleek, understand the implication to be that Christ underwent all the <i>bitterness</i> of death. But the phrase falls into exact accord with the general argument of the passage, that it became Christ, in order to be the great and merciful High Priest of humanity, to be perfected through human sufferings: and it forms in fact the first mention of this idea, and prepares the way for <b>for</b> which follows. I would say, that the word <b>taste</b> must be regarded as slightly emphatic, and as implying the personal undergoing of death and entering into its suffering. And I doubt much, whether it will not be found that in the other passages where the phrase occurs, this personal suffering of death, though not boldly prominent, is yet within view, and agreeable to the context. <br><br>And now, having considered the three points, <b>by the grace of God,</b>—<b>for every man,</b>—and <b>taste of death,</b> —we return again to the question of the connexion of <b>in order that</b>, with which this clause begins. We before stated that we find it dependent on the former clause, <i>on account of His suffering of death crowned with glory and honour.</i> This exaltation, being the <i>perfecting</i> [see ver. 10] of Christ, was arrived at <i>through sufferings,</i> and <i>on account of His suffering of death</i>,—both by means of, and on account of, His suffering of death, And this exaltation has made Him the divine Head of our humanity—the channel of grace, and the Captain of our salvation. Without His exaltation, his death would not have been effectual. Unless he had been crowned with glory and honour, received to the right hand of the Father, and set in expectation of all things being put under his feet, His death could not have been, for every man, the expiation to him of his own individual sin. On the <i>triumphant issue</i> of his sufferings, their efficacy depends. And this I believe is what the Sacred Writer meant to express. His glory was the consequence of his suffering of death; —arrived at through His suffering: but the applicability of His death to every man is the consequence of His constitution in Heaven as the great High Priest, in virtue of his blood carried into the holy place, —and the triumphant Head of our common humanity: which common humanity of Him and ourselves now becomes the subject of further elucidation).<h2><u><b>10.]</u></h2> For </b>(the connexion with the foregoing, see above. The <b>for</b> renders a reason why the result just introduced should have been one which the <i>grace of God</i> contemplated) <b>it became</b> (as matter not only of decorum, but of sequence from the data; —<i>‘was suitable to,’</i> not as matter of absolute necessity, which was not the question here. The expression here glances at those who found in a suffering and crucified Messiah something unsuitable to the Godhead; and expresses not merely a negative, that it was not unsuitable, not unworthy of God,—but at the same time the positive, that it was altogether correspondent to and worthy of His Being and His Wisdom and His Love, to take this course: that it is so shaped, that he who knows the being and attributes of God, might have expected it. And thus it is indirectly implied, that it was also the most suitable, and that any other way would have been less correspondent to the being and purpose of God. Bleek has some excellent remarks on the lingering of the offence of the cross among these Jewish Christians, who, although their ideas of the glory and kingly triumph of the Messiah been in a measure satisfied by the resurrection and exaltation of Christ, and their hopes awakened by the promise of future glory at His second coming,—<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E8XRHHJRWbFfSI3SBdlD7KIHdpfOft3-/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

To set forth then the way of suffering and the cross as one worthy of God’s high purpose, would be a natural course for the argument of the Writer to take) <b>Him, for whom are all things </b>(not only, ‘all those things which contribute to man’s salvation,’ but ‘the sum total of things,’ ‘the universe,’ as in the parallel passages. All created things are for God [see below], for His purpose and for His glory), <b>and by whom </b>(by whose will, and fiat, and agency) <b>are all things </b>(who <i>is intended?</i> From the sequel of the sentence there can be no doubt that it is God the Father. For the subject of this clause is there said to perfect Christ: and this could be predicated of none but the Father Himself. That these expressions are found frequently used of the Son, need be no objection: whatever is thus said of Him as the End, and the Worker, in creation may <i>à fortiori</i> be said of the Father who sent Him and of whose will He is the expression. As to the reason of this lengthened appellation here, Calvin well says: “He might have designated God in one word: but he wished to remind them that that was to be accounted <i>best</i>, which He decreed whose will and glory is the real end of all things.” And not only this: in introducing the <i>“becomingness”</i> of Christ's sufferings by such a description of God, he reminds his readers that those sufferings also were <b>for Him</b>—contributing to His end and His glory—and <b>by Him</b> brought about and carried through by His agency and superintendence), <b>bringing</b> (the application of the clause is to God the Father, the subject of the preceding. See the idea which refers it to <i>Christ</i> treated in my Greek Test. Some take the participle as past, <i>“having brought,”</i> referring the expression chiefly, or entirely, to the Old Test. saints. These however can hardly be meant; for they cannot be said in any adequate sense to have been led to glory, or to have had Christ for the Captain of their salvation, And surely it would be most unnatural to refer the participle to those saints only who had entered into glory since the completion of Christ’s work, but before this Epistle was written. The peculiar form of the participle here used has in all cases reference to the completion of the action. In Christ’s being <i>perfected</i>, the bringing many sons to glory is <i>completed</i>. Had it been a <i>present</i>, we must have rendered, as indeed the A. V. has erroneously rendered now, <i>‘in bringing:’</i> so that the Father’s <i>perfecting</i> of Christ would be <i>only a step in the process</i> of leading many sons to glory. But now it is <i>the whole process</i>. We cannot give in idiomatic English this delicate shade of meaning correctly: the nearest representation of it is, as in the text, perhaps—‘it became Him .... bringing, as He did, many sons to glory, to’ &c.) <b>many</b> (not in contrast to <i>all</i>, but in contrast to <i>few</i>, and in relation to one) <b>sons</b> (probably in the closer sense: not merely sons by creation, but sons by adoption. This seems necessitated by the next verse) <b>to glory</b> (the expression is not common in this meaning in our Epistle: and is perhaps chosen on account of the word occurring in ver. 9. It is, that supreme bliss and majesty which rightly belongs to God only—of which His divine Son is [ch. i. 3] the brightness or shining forth, and of which believers in Christ are here in their degree partakers, and shall be fully so hereafter. It is the crowning positive result of the negative word <i>salvation</i>), <b>to make perfect</b> (this word is used often in our Epistle, and in various references. It is said of the Redeemer Himself, here, and in ch. v. 9; vii. 28,—of His people, who are <i>made perfect</i> through Him, ix. 9; xi. 14, 40; xii. 23; and indeed xii. 2;—with a general reference, vii. 11, 19: see also <i>perfect</i> ch. v. 14; ix. 11,—and <i>perfection</i>, ch. vi. 1. From all this it is evident, that some meaning must be looked for wide enough to include all these senses of the word itself and its cognates. And such a sense is found in the ordinary rendering of the word,—to <i>“accomplish,”</i> or <i>“make complete,”</i> or <i>“perfect.”</i> This accomplishment, completion or perfecting of Christ was, the bringing Him to that glory which was His proposed and destined end: and it answers to the <i>“crowning with glory and honour”</i> of ver. 9: and to the <i>“glorifying”</i> of St. John: and fits exactly the requirements of the other passages in our Epistle where our Lord is spoken of. Nor is such meaning at all misplaced in those passages where <i>we</i> are<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RYjVNFsc3KQS2M0kOb5vNtic7FTsAWe_/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Some have imagined that the meaning here and elsewhere in our Epistle, of the word rendered <i>“to make perfect,”</i> is <i>“to consecrate:” </i>and understand the word of the setting apart or consecration of Christ to the high-priestly office. So Calvin [the first, as Bleek thinks, who propounded the view], Beza, and others. But Bleek replies well, that such a meaning will not suit the other passages in our Epistle, and besides, no such meaning is really ever found for the Greek word) <b>the Author </b>(<i>Captain</i>, in the A. V., introduces an idea foreign to the meaning of the title here used for our Lord. It is often found in the sense of <i>a leader </i>in the Septuagint: in that of the <i>progenitor of a race:</i> of one who <i>precedes others by his example</i>, they following him. Compare particularly ch. xii. 2, where the idea of <i>author</i> and <i>completer</i> is so closely allied to that in our verse, that the word <i>author</i> should have been kept here also. The idea of <i>origination</i> for the word frequently occurs in Greek writers, especially later ones, of the person from whom any thing, whether good or bad, first proceeds, in which others have a share. Hence the usage here, and in Acts iii. 15, where Christ is called <i>“the Prince of Life,”</i> is easily explained: on Him our salvation depends; He was its originator) <b>of their salvation through sufferings </b>(i.e. His sufferings were the appointed access to, and the appointed elements of, His glory: see more particularly below, on ch. v. 8, 9. Chrysostom gives a beautiful general application: “shewing us that he who suffers for another, does not benefit him alone, but also himself becomes more illustrious and nearer perfection”). <h2><u><b>11—13.]</u></h2></b> The connexion with the foregoing cannot be made plain, till we have discussed the meaning of <b>of one </b>below. It may suffice to say, that the assertion, and the quotations are subordinate to the words <i>“many sons”</i> in ver. 10. <h2><u><b>11.]</u></h2> For both the Sanctifier and (notice both—and,</b> which bind closely together in one category) <b>the sanctified</b> (sanctification is not here the same as <i>“salvation,”</i> but as every where, when used in allusion to Christ’s work on His people, involves that transforming and consecrating process, of which His Spirit is the actual agent. Hence, believers are ordinarily not described by the past participle, <i>“having been sanctified,”</i> but as here by the present, <i>“being sanctified.”</i> The word <b>to sanctify</b> signifies in the Septuagint and New Test. usually,<i> to select out:</i> and where their present state is spoken of, the participle is present: where God's purpose respecting them, and Christ's finished work, the perfect. Sanctification is glory working in embryo: glory is sanctification come to the birth and manifested. <br><br>It is disputed whether the reference of these words is to be considered as general, applying to every case of sanctifier and sanctified, as, e.g. the priest and the people under the old law, the firstfruits and the remaining harvest: or is to be restricted to Christ and His people alone. Certainly the latter seems to be required by the context, and most of all by the assumption of the subject in the next clause tacitly as contained in <i>he that sanctifieth</i>. The ground on which Christ is only Sanctifier has also been variously alleged. Grotius leaves the connexion very loose, when he says, “Christ makes us holy by His teaching and example. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and we by the Holy Spirit get a new nature: thus we both have a common origin.” But this obviously does not reach the depth of the following argument, see especially ver. 17: and we must believe that there is a reference to the expiatory death of Christ: see also ch. x. 10, 14, and more in the note there) <b>[are] of one</b> (<b>one</b>, as will he seen by the reference in my Greek Test., must be taken as <i>masculine</i>. And if masculine, what are we to supply? Some say, <i>Adam:</i> others, <i>Abraham.</i> But it seems far better and simpler here, on account of the expression <b>many sons,</b> above, and as satisfying fully the force of <b>of,</b> or <b>out of,</b> to understand <i>God</i> to be meant.

The same is plain from ver. 14 below: see there. So that it is the higher Sonship of God, common to the Lord and those whom the Father by Him is leading to glory which must be understood. See John viii. 47; 1 John iii. 10; iv. 6; v. 19; 3 John 11.<br><br>Note, that the point brought out here is not that the holiness of our Lord’s human nature, and our holiness, are both of one, viz. the Father [John x. 36]: which, however true, would be introducing a matter not belonging to the argument <i>here</i>), <b>all [of them]:</b> <b>on which account</b> (viz. because they are all of one) <b>He</b> (Christ: see above) <b>is not ashamed</b> (His consent in this relationship springs, as Chrysostom says, not from the nature of the case merely, but from His extreme love and condescension) <b>to call them</b> (that are sanctified) <b>brethren, saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the assembly will I sing of thee</b> (it will be sufficient to refer, respecting the general sense and prophetic import of Ps. xxii., to what has been before said, on Ps. viii. [above ver. 6], and on similar citations elsewhere. The Psalm was originally the expression of a suffering saint, in all probability David, communing with his God: laying forth to Him his anguish and finally triumphing in confidence of His gracious help and deliverance. But by the mouth of such servants of God did the prophetic Spirit speak forth His intimations respecting the Redeemer to come. No word prompted by the Holy Ghost had reference to the utterer only. All Israel was a type: all spiritual Israel set forth the second Man, the quickening spirit: all the groanings of God's suffering people prefigured, and found their fullest meaning in, His groans, who was the chief in suffering. The maxim cannot be too firmly held, nor too widely applied, that all the Old Test. utterances of the Spirit anticipate Christ, just as all His New Test. utterances set forth and expand Christ: that Christ is everywhere involved in the Old Test., as He is every where evolved in the New Test. And this Psalm holds an illustrious place among those which thus point onward to Christ. Its opening cry, “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” was uttered by the Lord Himself in His last agony. The most minute particulars detailed in it are by the Evangelists adduced as exemplified in the history of His Passion; see e.g. John xix. 24 And, as Bleek well observes, the particulars chosen out of that history by St. Matthew seem to have been selected with an especial view to the illustration and fulfilment of this Psalm. Ebrard, in his note here, insists on the authorship of the Psalm by David, and on its date, as belonging to the time of his persecution by Saul, Then he maintains the exact parallelism of the circumstances with those of the second and greater David, and refers the <i>“brethren”</i> here to the countrymen of David, who were hereafter to be his subjects. I have no positive objection to this view. Subordinately to the deeper and wider one, it might be applicable in individual instances: but that other seems to me both safer and nearer the truth. The particular verse here chosen, the 22nd, forms the transition-point from the suffering to the triumphant portion of the Psalm: and consequently the resolution expressed in it by the Messiah has reference to His triumphant state, in which he is still not ashamed to call his people brethren. It is characteristic of the object of this Epistle with reference to intended readers, that whereas the Writer might have cited two instances as matters of fact, in which our Lord did call His disciples brethren after His resurrection [see John xx. 17; Matt. xxviii. 10], yet he has not done so, but has preferred to establish his point by the Old Test. citations).<h2><u><b>13.]</u></h2> And again, I will put my trust in Him</b> (there is considerable dispute as to the original place from which this citation comes.

Delitzsch has gone into it at length, and Hofmann has treated of it in two places. Both are agreed that <b>the holy place</b> betokens the immediate immaterial presence of God, the veritable Holy of Holies, beyond, and ap- approached through, the heavens, ch. iv. 14. But as regards <b>the tabernacle</b> they differ. Hofmann maintains it to be the glorified body of Christ, and argues that it alone will satisfy such expressions as that in ch. ix. 11, “<i>not of this creation:</i>” in order to satisfying which, this <i>tabernacle</i> must belong to the new creation, the <i>regeneration</i>, which commences with the glorification of Christ. This glorified body of His is the new and abiding temple of God, in which He dwells and meets with us who are united to and have put on that glorified body, our house, eternal in the heavens: for so Hofmann interprets 2 Cor. v. 1 ff. On the other hand, Delitzsch controverts this view, as inconsistent with the symbolism in ch. ix. 11, 12, where Christ, “through the greater and more perfect tabernacle .... entered into the holy place,” taking this connexion of the words: and also with our ver. 5, where the Mosaic tabernacle is set forth as the representation and shadow of the heavenly. Accordingly, he believes the <i>tabernacle</i> here to be the heavenly Jerusalem, the worship-place of blessed spirits [Ps. xxix. 9] and of those men who have been rapt in vision thither [Isa. vi.],–the “<i>temple of the tabernacle Of witness</i>,” of Rev. xv.5,—the place where God's <i>visible</i> presence [in contradistinction to His personal and invisible presence in the <i>holy places</i>] is manifested to his creatures angelic and human. In weighing these two opinions, I own they seem to me to run into one, and of that one by far the larger component is on Hofmann’s side.<br><br>For what is the Heavenly Jerusalem ? What but the aggregate, in their persons and their glorious abiding-place, of the triumphant saints and servants of God? And what is this aggregate, but the mystical body of which Christ is the Head and they are the members, in its fulfilment and perfection? That glorified body of His, in which they are accepted before God, and in which as a heavenly temple they serve God, and God dwells, He has passed through, not by passing out of it, but by finally establishing it as an accomplished thing in God's sight, and in and as proceeding forth from it carrying on his intercession and <i>ministration in the true tabernacle</i>, in the <i>holy place</i> itself, See more on this subject, ch. ix. 11: and the views of Bleek, Tholuck, &c.: also a sermon of Schileiermacher’s on the text, vol. ii, of his Predigten, p. 504).<h2><u><b>3—6.</b>]</u></h2> This <i>heavenly office and work our High Priest must have, if He le veritably a High Priest.</i> <b>3.</b>] <b>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices</b> (see the very similar passage, ch. v. 1, and note there): <b>whence it is necessary that this (High Priest) also have somewhat which He may offer</b> (there is here considerable difficulty. For the Writer is evidently, from what follows, laying the stress on the <i>heavenly “ministry”</i> of Christ: and this “<i>somewhat to offer</i>” applies therefore to His work, not on earth, but in heaven, If so, how comes it to be said that He has somewhat to offer in heaven, seeing that His offering, of Himself, was made once for all, in contradistinction to those of the Levitical priests which were being constantly offered? See especially ch. x. 11, 12, which, on this view, brings the Writer here into direct contradiction to himself, In order to avoid this, Lũnemann and Hofmann attempt to make the “<i>somewhat to offer</i>” retrospective: “it is necessary for Him to have [there, in heaven] somewhat [viz.

Thus regarded then, what is it which our High Priest in heaven has to offer? In ch. v.7, He is described as <i>having offered</i> prayers and supplications in the days of His flesh: and it might be thought that His <i>interceding for us</i>, ch. vii. 25, might be here meant, the offering being those intercessions. But this would hardly satisfactorily give the force of the word <b>somewhat</b>, which,as Delitzsch remarks, is too concrete for such an interpretation. It must be something with which and by virtue of which, and as offering and applying which, our High Priest enters and ministers in the Holy of Holies above. Now if we look to the analogy of ch. ix. <b>7, 12, </b> we see (1) that the high priest entered the holy place “<i>not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the ignorances of the people,</i>”—(2) that Christ is entered into the <i>holy places of heaven, not with the blood of goats and bulls, but by</i> <b>His own blood</b>: see also ib. ver. 25. This BLOOD of the one offering, Christ is represented as bearing into the Holy Place, and its application is set ever forth to us as a continuing and constantly repeated one. Thus this <i>blood of sprinkling</i> is regarded us being in <i>heaven</i>, ch. xii. 24: as <i>being sprinkled on the believer as the end of his election</i>, 1 Pet. i. 2: as<i> cleansing us from all sin</i>, 1 John i. 7: as <i>that wherein the saints wash their robes and make them white</i>, Rev. vii. 14. Still, as Delitzsch also remarks, this is not the place to enlarge on this matter, seeing that it is merely incidentally introduced here, the present object being to shew that it is in heaven, and not on earth, that our High Priest ministers). <b>4.]</u></h2> Yea, if</b> (the connexion is<br><br>obvious: “our High Priest must have somewhat to offer.

I do not see that there is much to choose between the two views. If the latter be taken, then surely the vision thus vouchsafed to Moses was itself only an intermediate representation, and so this view comes much to the same as the other. <b>6.]</u></h2> But now</b> (the logical, not the temporal <i>now</i>, as in ch. ix. 26; xi. 16, and frequently in St. Paul, meaning, “as the fact really is”) H<b>e hath obtained a more excellent ministry</b> (than that of any earthly priests), <b>in proportion as He is also</b> (<b>also</b>, introducing a special reference to an already acknowledged fact, as in ch. vi. 7, where see note) <b>mediator </b>(the meaning of the word is, one who becomes a goer between two persons, assuring to each the consent of the other to some point agreed on in common.

There took place, at God’s special command, his prophecies of the future entire restoration of Israel, of another David, of Rachel’s wailing over her children at Rama, and their future return, of the new covenant resting on absolute and veritable forgiveness of sins which Jehovah would make with his people, these prophecies forming the third part of the third trilogy of the three great trilogies into which the prophecies of Jeremiah may be divided: ch.xxi.—xxv., the book against the shepherds of the people: ch. xxvi.—xxix., the book of Jeremiah’s conflict against the false prophets: ch. xxx., xxxi., the book of restoration,” Delitzsch: “The question which has before now been abundantly handled, whether the saying refers to the return of the exiles, or to the covenant of which Christ is the mediator, or to the future general conversion of the Jews, or whether some things in it to one of these, some to another, or whether the whole in its lower literal sense to the return of the exiles and in its higher spiritual sense to Christ and His kingdom, must be answered by the considerations before adduced on ch. i. 5.

On the face of their not continuing in God's covenant, Delitzsch gives a striking quotation from Schelling, –“The Law appears to be the mere ideal of a religious constitution, as it has never existed in fact: in practice, the Jews were almost throughout polytheists. The substance of their national feeling was formed by heathendom; the accidents only, by revelation. From the queen of heaven down to the abominations of the Phoeniciaus, and even to Cybele, the Jews passed through every grade of paganism.” “In fact,” adds Delitzsch, “there is no period of the history of Israel before the captivity, in which more or less idolatry was not united with the worship of Jehovah, except the time of David and the first years of Solomon, during which the influence of Samuel still continued to be felt. And when by the captivity Idol-worship was completely eradicated from the people, as far at least as regards that part of it which returned, it is well known that a hypocritical letter-worship got the mastery over them, which was morally very little better.” See note on Matt. xii. 43. <b>10.</b>]</u></h2> <b>For</b> (the reason rendered is for the expression “<i>new</i>,” above: “<i>new, I say:</i> <i>for</i>…”) <b>this</b> (predicate, explained in what follows) <b>is the covenant which I will establish to the house of Israel</b> (Israel here in its wider sense, comprehending both Israel proper and Judah : because then all Israel shall be again united) <b>after those days</b> (after the end of that dispensation, when those days of disregard are over), saith the <b>Lord, giving</b> (or, <b>putting</b>.

Under the old covenant, the priests’ lips were to keep knowledge, and they were to teach the people God’s ways: under the new, there is no more need for the believer to have recourse to man for teaching in the knowledge of God, for the Holy Spirit, which is given to all that ask, reveals the things of Christ to each, according to the measure of his spiritual attainment and strength of faith.

See also ib. vv. 2, 4, 5, So that we can hardly help giving to ‘witnesses’ a sense not confined to their” looking on upon us, but extending to their ethical condition of witnesses for the faith. But we may notice, that Delitzsch in contending for this double sense, has in fact a triple reference of the word to justify: they are <i>borne witness</i> to, they have their <i>testimony</i>, ch. xi, 5: and by this they become <i>witnesses</i>: and they carry out that office in being witnesses “of our conflict here below. And now the propriety of the other words used at once appears. <b>cloud</b>, not only an immense multitude, and that number as it were pressing us all around as the spectators did the combatants in the circus—but also fitly compared to a cloud from the fact of its being <i>above us</i>, they looking on from that heavenly bliss which they entered at Christ’s triumph. So that the words must be taken as distinctly so far implying community between the church triumphant and the church below, that they who have entered into heavenly rest are conscious of what passes among ourselves. Any interpretation short of this leaves the exhortation here tame and without point. If they are merely quasi-witnesses, merely witnesses in a metaphor, the motive, as far as this clause supplies one, is gone. The best note on the whole idea and imagery is that of Schlichting: “He introduces us as it were into an immense theatre, where a vast crowd of spectators has assembled, which fills all the benches and spaces, seeming like a dense cloud poured around those contending in the middle. Before the eyes of such a multitude, and so many spectators, he represents us contending. Now as of old such a multitude of spectators added courage to the combatants, and was a great stimulus to use every effort for victory: so to us also, so many witnesses, who also themselves have toiled in the same conflict, ought to add alacrity, and cause us to run with all our force the race which we have begun. And he calls them <i>witnesses</i>, not only in a figure, allusive to the spectators of a contest, as we have said, who are witnesses of the prowess of those who contend; but, and much more, because they witness concerning God and His goodness and justice, and all as with one mouth declare that God is, and is a rewarder of those who seek Him: that with Him, as the Chief Lord of the games, there is laid up a prize for earnest contenders: that He is true in His promises; that even after death He can render those happy who for His sake have given their lives. For, thirdly, they are specially to be understood in this place by the name, who by their blood, witness to the faithfulness and goodness of God. Whence they are par excellence called <i>martyrs</i>, i.e. witnesses”), <b>laying aside all superfluous weight</b> (the word means, <i>any superfluous mass or burden.</i> It is used doubtless here with direct reference to athletes, who before running trained themselves so as to get rid of all superfluous flesh: and also of weight accessory from without, as well as of weight carried on the person. So that the word may be taken of every weight of every kind which may weigh down the runner. Though, on account of what follows, I should understand it rather of weight <i>of</i> the person than weight <i>on </i>the person.

The word being thus taken, the various acceptations of the similitude intended are well summed up hy Bleek: we must understand <b>sin </b>either us our inner propensity to sin, which clings fast to us, and will not part from us: or as a cumbersome garment girding us round and hindering us from running, or personified, as an adversary, who surrounds us on all sides, and waylays us to make us his prey; or generally, as something which lies about us and is ever ready to catch us: or which is ever from all sides standing in the way so as to entangle and impede our course.

Of both these <b>laying aside</b> may be said; of the former literally, of the lntter figuratively. And in choosing between these two, I have no hesitation in preferring the former. The Writer is speaking of our <i>race:</i> and having expected us to lay aside all superfluous weight of body, which the athletes did, he passes to their other lightening for the race, viz., <i>stripping naked</i>, and exhorts us to put off sin, which Ties so easily about us. Most likely perhaps the word <b>sin</b> alludes especially, though it need not exclusively, to apostasy. There does not seem to be any allusion to the different sins which may, in the sense now so common, and originally derived from this passage in A.V., “<i>beset</i>” various persons: though, of course, such an <i>application</i> of the passage is quite admissible), <b>let us through</b> (not merely ‘<i>with,</i>” although we must so express ourselves in am English <i>version</i>, but as <i>the state in, by means of which</i>) <b>endurance run the race set before us,</b> <h2><u><b>2.</b>]</u></h2><b> looking unto </b>(so A.V. very exactly. There does not appear to be in the word here used any intimation of looking <i>off from every thing else unto</i>, as sometimes asserted) <b>the Leader </b>(one who precedes others by his example, they following him. But see note on ch. ii, 10. <i>Author</i> seems the best English word here, as there) <b>and Perfecter</b> (this is variously interpreted. The most likely meaning is that H<i>e perfected the faith</i>, inasmuch as He perfected faith in his own person and example: <i>but He perfected the faith</i> also, inasmuch as He became the Author of perfect salvation to them that obey Him. His going before us in faith has made faith possible for us: His perfecting faith in his own person and example, has made faith effectual tor us) <b>of the faith</b> (viz. that faith of which we have been speaking through ch. xi.: and thus rather “<i>the faith</i>” than “<i>our faith,</i>” which latter is liable to the mistake so often made in English, viz. to being taken us if it meant <i>faith in us</i>, so that Jesus should be said to be “author and finisher” of each individual Christian’s faith which he has within him. The word here may be rendered merely “faith” without the article; but it would seem most probable that the article here used in the original, whereas it was not throughout ch. xi., is intended to have a definite force. Besides which, the ascription of faith to our Lord is so plain in our Epistle, compare ch. ii. 13; iii. 2, that we must not seem to exclude this sense in our rendering, which we certainly do by “<i>our faith:</i>” whereas “<i>the faith</i>” includes both, and satisfies that which follows, in which His own example of endurance in prospect of triumph is set before us), [<b>even</b>] <b>Jesus, who for</b> (literally, <b>instead of</b>: see below) <b>the joy set before Him</b> (the words of the original thus rendered have been otherwise interpreted both by ancients and moderns, The ancient Syriac version, Beza, and others, take it to mean, “<i>instead of the joy which He had before His incarnation.</i>” But this, though not an incorrect <i>rendering</i>, seems to me doubly objectionable. First, which many have noticed, <i>joy</i> which He already had could not well be designated as <i>set before Him</i>: and then, which I have not seen noticed, the term <b>joy </b>can hardly be used of a state of bliss in which one already is, a quiescent or pre-existent joy, but more naturally applies to joy prompted by some cause of active rejoicing. Then another modification of this same view is found in Chrysostom, viz., that the preferable alternative of escaping the cross was before Him, and He might have taken it, if He would. And so Luther, Calvin, and others. But this again, though it might satisfy the “<i>set before Him,</i>” falls short of the above sense maintained for <i>joy</i>. Erasmus and others explain it, that He <i>despised the joys of this life</i>. This makes <b>joy</b> identical with <i>pleasure</i>, besides giving a low and unworthy sense to the joy<i> set before Him</i>, in making it to mean the pleasures of this life. The sense given above, “for the joy set before Him,” i.e. as in comparison with, as in exchange for, the joy which was to come after in the day of His triumph, is adopted by most Commentators,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwyMB0d-EW5-ftdQ40lwe7se1hOWvGuK/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Yes, and for this very reason the <i>resisting</i> that sin of unfaithfulness which would lead them to <i>spare</i> their blood, would, if carried far enough, lead to the shedding of it.

C.,</i>” but, as Œcumenius, “by <b>God</b>, he means the Father: by <b>Lord</b>, the Son.” Huther remarks, that in all the addresses of Epistles, the whole name <i>Jesus Christ</i> is given. St. James mentions our Lord only here and ch. ii. 1 in this Epistle, and not at all in his speeches in Acts xv. and xxi. Bengel says, “It might have seemed, if he had often named Jesus, as if he did it to exalt himself as the brother of our Lord. For that very reason, he ‘knew Christ according to the flesh’ less than others”), <b>to the twelve tribes</b> (of Israel: nor can there be any reasonable doubt that this Epistle was addressed to Jewish Christians in the first place. Not however to them, as distinguished from Gentile Christians: for the two classes appear to have<br><br>been not as yet distinct. If the later date of the Epistle be taken [see Introd.], then the Jewish Christians are addressed as the nucleus and kernel of all Christendom. But to my mind, the former is more probable) <b>which are in the dispersion</b> (the most likely reference of this word is to the literal and actual Jewish dispersion: and the Epistle must be considered as addressed, from the head of the mother church in Jerusalem, to the Jewish believers, residing among the dispersed tribes of Israel), <b>greeting</b> (the formula thus rendered is not found in the address of any other apostolical Epistle; but it occurs in the Epistle drawn up under the direction of James to the Gentile churches in Acts xv. 23).<h2><u><b>2—12.]</u></h2></b> <i>Exhortations regarding the endurance of trials</i>. <b>Think it all joy</b> (the word <i>joy</i> is taken up out of the word rendered greeting, which literally means <i>to rejoice</i>.

Many interpret it of sending away with a refusal: the word will not bear this meaning. By far the greatest part of Commentators understand it of reproaching by the recounting of benefits bestowed. But this again does not reach the full and general nature of the expression here. The real meaning here is just as in Ecclus. xx. 15, “He giveth little, and upbraideth much,” and in Ecclus. xli. 22, “After thou hast given, upbraid not,” viz. upbraiding with any kind of reproaches, as God might well do, so unworthy are we to approach Him with any request.

Huther says well, “<i>Doubt</i> is not <i>unbelief</i> [Luke xxiv. 11], but includes in it the essential character of <i>unbelief:</i> while <i>faith</i> says ‘Yes,’ and <i>unbelief</i> ‘No,’ <i>doubt</i> is the union of ‘Yes’ and ‘No,’ but so that ‘No’ is the weightier: it is that inward giving way which leans not to <i>faith</i>, but to <i>unbelief</i>. ‘The deep-lying ground of it is <i>pride</i>”): <b>for he that doubteth is like a wave of the sea</b> (see Eph. iv. 14 and Isa. lvii. 20) <b>driven by the wind and tossed about</b> (the word forms a synonym with the former, “<i>driven by the wind:</i>” and the use of these synonymous expressions so close to one another is again a characteristic of St. James. A good explanation of the figure is quoted by Wiesinger from Heisen: “Sometimes he is east on the shore of faith and hope, sometimes he is rolled back into the deep of distrust: now he is borne up into the height of worldly pride, now he is mingled with the lowest sands of desperation and trouble”): <b>for</b> (takes up and repeats the former <b>for</b>) <b>let not that man</b> (said with a certain slight expression of contempt) <b>think that he shall receive any thing</b> (viz. of what he asks: some things, as life, food, raiment, &c., he does continually receive) <b>from the Lord</b> (i.e. as usually in this Epistle, from GOD. So ch. iv. 10, 15; v.4, 10, 11: see at each of those places. On the other hand, “<i>the Lord,</i>” ch. v. 7, 14, 15, is used of Christ. Hofmann remarks that where the Father is not expressly distinguished from the Son by the context, the Godhead, in its unity, is to be understood by the word <b>God</b>: and the same may be said of <b>the Lord</b>).<h2><u><b>8.]</u></h2> He is a man with two minds, unstable in all his ways</b> (such is the best way of taking this sentence, making it all predicate and all to apply to <b>that man</b> as its subject. The common way, to take “<i>a double-minded man</i>” as a new subject, as A. V. ‘a double-minded man is unstable,’ has this against it, that it makes the very unusual word “<b>doubled-souled,</b>” found here and in ch. iv. 8 for the first time in Greek literature, to be a mere usual epithet and word of passage).<h2><u><b>9.]</u></h2> </b>The connexion appears to he this: we must not pray before God, we must not be before God, double-minded; in our trials, we shall get no heavenly wisdom, if this is so. This double-mindedness, one soul drawn upwards to God, the other drawn downwards to the world, causes nothing but instability, and cannot result in that joy which is to be <i>our </i>attitude in trial. And it arises from misapprehension of our appointed state in trial: the poor and humble forget the exceeding honour thus done to him, which ought to be to him ground of boasting, far more worthy than (see below) the rich in this world have in their riches which shall so soon fade away: whereas (ver. 12) he that is tried shall receive a crown of life from the Lord. <b>But </b>(contrasted with the <i>double-mindedness </i>above) <b>let the brother</b> (the Christian believer) <b>who is low</b> (poor and afflicted; not merely, low in station: this explanation disappears with the view that <i>the rich man</i> [below] is Christian also) <b>glory in his exaltation</b> (which he has obtained by being admitted into the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings, and which he has further in reversion in the glorious crown of life hereafter, ver. 12): <b>but the rich </b>(not the rich <i>brother,</i> nor is the rich to be understood any otherwise than in the rest of the Epistle, compare ch. ii. 6f., v. 1ff.

It seems that we must take refuge in the ordinary meaning of the word, and render it ‘<i>unversed in,</i>’ having no experience of), <b>but HE tempteth no man: but each man is tempted, being</b> (slightly causal, ‘in that he is’) <b>drawn out and enticed by</b> (it is the same preposition in the Greek as above, ver. 13: the source rather than the agent : but we cannot here render it <i>from</i>, as the sentence would thus become ambiguous) <b>his own lust</b> (James is not here speaking of the <i>original</i> source of sin in man, but of the actual source of temptation to sin, when it occurs. The “<i>sin</i>” of St. Paul, the sinful principle in man, is not here in question: we take up the matter, so to speak, lower down the stream: and the <i>lust</i> here is the <i>lust</i> there, itself the effect of sin [abstr.] in the members, and leading to sin [concrete] in the conduct): <h2><u><b>15.</b>]</u></h2> <b>then lust having conceived, bringeth forth sin: and sin, when completed, bringeth forth death</b> (it has been questioned whether <b>sin</b> is here in one, or in two senses. De Wette holds that the first <b>sin</b> is the purpose, or inner act, of sin,—the <i>completion</i>, carrying this <i>sin</i> out into an act, which act brings forth death, the wages of sin. But this is decidedly wrong. Wiesinger has disputed it, and insisted rightly that the <i>inner act</i> is the union of the will with the <i>lust</i>, the “<i>bringing forth</i>” denoting extrusion into outward act: then the second <i>sin</i>,—which Huther rightly maintains to be the sinful act when brought to perfection in all its consequences, in a series of results following on one another and bringing a man under bondage to his sin,—being thus perfected, brings forth eternal death. The imagery is throughout consistent. The harlot <b>lust draws away</b> and <b>entices</b> the man: the guilty union is committed by the will embracing the temptress: the consequence is that she<b> conceives sin</b>, sin, in general, of some kind, of that kind to which the temptation inclines : then [so literally], <b>the sin</b>, that particular sin, when grown up and mature, herself <b>bringeth forth</b>, as if all along pregnant with it, Death, the final result of sin. So that <i>temptation to sin</i> cannot be from God, while <i>trial</i> is from Him. The one, being our proof, works endurance, and endurance, when she has a perfect work, life: the other, being a bait and excitement arising from lust, “brings forth sin, and sin being completed, brings forth <b>death.</b>” The English reader will not fail to remember Milton’s sublime allegory in Paradise Lost, where Satan, by his<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nCt7gYZWCTsyudfwlLq28uf7kB-IljBk/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Weisinger beautifully says, “The thought fully given would be this: they by Regeneration were dedicated as the firstfruits of a sacrificial gift which shall only be completed with the offering up of all <i>creatures</i>”) <b>of His creatures</b> (this expression manifestly extends wider than merely to the great multitude of the regenerated whom no mun can number; it embraces all creation, which we know shall partake in the ultimate glorious perfection of the sons of God: see Rom. viii. 20, 21. Wiesinger has an important note, shewing from this verse what must be the right understanding of much which follows in this Epistle. “This passage,” he says, “is among those which reveal the depth of Christian knowledge in which the practical and moral exhortations of the Writer are grounded: lying as it does expressly (‘<i>wherefore,</i>’ ver. 21) at the basis of them. We will here bring together in a few words the teaching of the passage, for the sake of its important bearing on the rest of the Epistle. It teaches us 1) as a positive supplement to vv. 14, 15, that the life of man must be renewed, from its very root and foundation: 2) it designates this renewal as God’s work, moreover as an imparting of the life of God, as only possible by the working of the Spirit, only on the foundation of the objective fact of our Redemption in Christ, which is the content of the <i>word of truth:</i> 3) it sets forth this re-generation as an act once for all accomplished, and distinguishes it from the gradual penetration and sanctification of the individual life by means of this new principle of life imparted in the re-generation : 4) it declares also expressly that the re-generation is a free act of God’s love not induced by any work of man (Eph. ii. 8, 9; Tit. iii. 5), so that man is placed by God in his right relation to God, antecedently to all works well-pleasing to God: for this the expression <b>begat He us</b> involves: and in so far as this <i>begetting</i> necessarily implies the justification of the sinner (to use the language of St. Paul), it is plain also, that St. James cannot, without contradicting himself, make this <i>justification</i>, in the sense of St. Paul, dependent on the works of faith. 5) <i>the word of</i> <i>truth</i> is specified as the objective medium of re-generation : and herewith we must have <i>faith </i>as the appropriating medium on the part of man himself: of the central import of which <i>faith </i>in St. James also we have already seen something (vv. 3, 6), and shall see more (ch. ii. 5, 14 ff.). 6) Together with this act of re-generation proceeding from God, we have also the high destination of the Christian, which the Apostle gives so significantly and deeply in these words, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures. And that which God has done to him, is now in the following verses made the foundation of that which the Christian has on his part to do: by which that which we said under 3) and 4) receives fresh confirmation. This passage is one to be remembered, when we to know what the Apostle understands by the <i>perfect law</i> (i. 25, ii. 12), and what he means, when (ii. 14 ff.) he deduces <i>justification </i>from the works of faith. As regards the dogmatical use, which some make of this passage, wishing to shew that regeneration is brought about by the word, as distinguished from the Sacrament of Baptism (Tit. iii. 5–7), we may remark, that seeing that <b>the word of truth</b> designates the gospel, as a whole, without any respect to such distinction, nothing regarding it can be gathered from this passage. The word of the Lord constitutes, we know, the force of the Sacrament also.

Be not intemperately zealous, hastily rash to speak and to be angered, even in God’s behalf [for this is implied]: be humble, ready to listen:—for your angry zeal, your quick speaking, work not God’s righteous purposes— serve not Him, are not carriers forward of that righteousness which is the characteristic of His kingdom, ch. iii. 18.

And, thus taken, it will mean that <i>malignity </i>pollutes the soul, and renders it unfit to receive the <i>implanted word</i>. It is very possible that the agricultural similitude in the word <b>implanted</b> may have influenced the choice of both these words, <i>filthiness </i>and <i>superabundance.</i> The ground must be ridded of all that pollutes and chokes it, before the seed can sink in and come to maturity; must be cleaned and cleared) and abundance (‘<i>superfluity</i>’ is perhaps too strong: it is, if the above figure be allowed, the rank growth, the abundant crop) <b>of malignity</b> (evil disposition towards one another. ‘The word carries on the “<i>wrath</i>” above: which springs from <i>malignity</i>, evil disposition, which is inherent in our hearts, and requires putting off before we can receive the word of God.

The expression is to be explained apparently as Wiesinger: “Not that he can see in the glass any other than his natural face, but the addition serves more plainly to point out the sphere of mere material perception from which the comparison is taken, as distinguished from the ethical sphere of ‘<i>hearing the word</i>,’ aud at the same time hints at the easy translation of the remark from the one department to the other, in which ‘the word of God is a mirror in which we may and ought to see our moral visage,’ as De Wette”) <b>in a mirror: for</b> (this seems to stamp the example as a general one, applying to all, not merely taking some possible man who may do this; see above) <b>he contemplated himself, and has departed, and immediately forgot of what appearance he was</b> (viz. in the mirror. It is to be observed, that the <i>contemplating</i> answers to the hearing of the word: the <i>going away</i> to the relaxing the attention after hearing—letting the mind go elsewhere, and the interest of the thing heard pass away: and then the forgetfulness in both cases follows. In the next verse we pass to one who looks and does not depart). <b>But he who looked into</b> (here we have the figure mingled with the reality, the comparison being dropped. Probably the verb used here, which signifies <i>to stoop and look in</i>, has reference to a mirror being placed on a table or on the ground, to contemplate which steadily, a man must put his face near to it. But we must not perhaps urge this too strictly: for in 1 Pet. i. 12, it is used of looking closely into any thing.

The whole Epistle is founded on this perfect law of Christ, more especially on that declaration of it contained in the Sermon on the mount: see Introd.

Huther remarks, “Ever in the Old Test. the sweetness of the law was subject of praise [Ps xix. 8–11], But the life-giving power belonged to the law only in an imperfect manner, because the covenant on which it rested, was as yet only one of promise, and not of fulfilment”), <b>and remains there</b> (remains looking in, does not depart as the other.

You are not then whole in that faith.” See the other explanations discussed in my Greek Test.) <b>within yourselves</b> (in your own minds, being at issue with your own faith), <b>and become judges</b> (in the case of the rich and poor ; judges of the case before you), <b>of evil thoughts</b> (the genitive is one of quality.

But God honours the poor: therefore he inverts God’s order, who rejects them.” Calvin. This is his first argument. Now, vv. 6, 7, he brings in another, deduced from the conduct of rich men towards Christians, and towards Christ Himself). <b>Do not the rich</b> (opposed as a class, to <i>the poor</i> above. This serves to shew that “<i>the rich man</i>,” when generally spoken of in the Epistle, as e.g. ch. i. 10, is not the Christian rich man, but the rich man as such, in his worldliness and enmity to God) <b>oppress you</b> (literally, use power, or lordship, or licence, against you to your hurt), <b>and is it not they that drag you</b> (the term implies violence) <b>to courts of judgment</b> (see ch. v. 6. The words may refer either to persecutions, or to oppressive law-suits; or perhaps to both, See on the matter, 1 Cor. vi. 2, 4)? <h2><u><b>7.]</u></h2></b> <b>Is it not they that blaspheme</b> (actually and literally, in words, it being, as we have maintained throughout, ungodly and heathens who are pointed at. Those who maintain them to be Christian rich men, would understand this <i>blasphemy</i> of disgracing by their lives) <b>the goodly name which was called on you</b> (i.e. which when you were admitted into Christ’s Church by baptism was made yours, so that you are called <i>Christ's</i>, 1 Cor. iii. 28 [not necessarily “<i>Christians:</i>” no particular form of the appropriation of the name is alluded to, but only the fact of the name being called over them. The appellation may or may not have been in use at this time, for aught that this shews]. The name is of course that of <i>Christ:</i> not that of God, as some think, nor that of ‘brethren,’ as others)? So that if ye thus dishonour the poor in comparison with the rich, you are 1) contravening the standard of honour which God sets up in His dealings: 2) opposing your own interest: 3) helping to blaspheme the name of Christ.<h2><u><b>8—11.]</u></h2></b> <i>Proof that this behaviour is a transgression of God’s law.</i> The connexion is somewhat recondite. The adversative <b>yet</b> clearly takes exception at something, expressed or understood. Calvin and others suppose the Apostle to be meeting an objection of his readers:—“But thus, according to you, we should he breaking the injunction, Love thy neighbour, &c., for we should view the rich with hatred and contempt.” Then he replies, “Certainly, if ye, &c. ye do well:” understanding <b>ye do well</b> as a very feeble approbation. But this seems to me very unnatural. It contains indeed the germ of the true view, which appears to be this: The Apostle is not replying to a fancied objection on the part of others, but is guarding his own argument from misconstruction: “All this is true of the rich. Still I do not say, hate them, drive them from your assemblies, &c.: if you choose to observe faithfully the great command, Love others as yourselves, in your conduct to all, well and good: but respect of persons, instead of being a keeping, is a breach of this law; for I have proved it to be sin, and he who commits sin is a transgressor of the law, of the whole law, by the very terms of legal obedience.” Thus the context seems to run smoothly and naturally. <b>Yet</b> (for the connexion see above) <b>if ye fulfil</b> (if ye really choose to <i>fulfil</i> in its completeness that law) <b>the royal law</b> (the law which is the king of all laws, as the old saying makes <i>law itself king of all.</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11f-76AvI8FJk1BXCI0-psa_kl5qYGQkA/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Now if thou committest no adultery, but committest murder, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.</b> Various fanciful reasons have. been given for the selection of these two commandments: ‘because these two were punished with death,’ Baumgarten: ‘because no one had laid a charge of adultery against the readers, but the other they violated by violating the law of love,’ Wiesinger. But it is far more likely that they are alleged as the two first which regard our duty to our neighbour generally : the prohibition of adultery being put first, as in Mark x. 19; Luke xviii. 20; Rom. xiii. 9; Philo also has this order, and lays a stress on it, as shewing that adultery is the greatest of social crimes. So that this order must have been one preserved in ancient tradition: or perhaps found anciently in the Septuagint. The Rabbis have the same sentiment as this. They say of the thirty-nine precepts of Moses, “If a man do them all, but omit one, he is guilty of all and every of them.”<h2><u><b>12, 13.]</u></h2></b> <i>Concluding and summary exhortations,</i> to speak and act as subject to the law of liberty and love. <b>So speak, and so do</b> (<b>so</b> both times does not regard what has gone before, but what follows. <i>Speaking</i> had been before hinted at in ch. i. 19: and will come again under consideration in ch. iii.), <b>as being about to be judged by</b> (by means of, as the measure by which your lives will be estimated) <b>the law of liberty</b> (the same as in ch. i. 25: that perfect expansion of God’s will, resting on the free unrestrained principle of love,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ak1soyDnR9H-gvvOxyVVqJEG0_L5X_ZO/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The meaning is, the judgment which would condemn any and all of us, is, in the case of merciful, overpowered by the blessed effect of mercy, and mercy prevails over it. The saying is abstract: to turn it into a concrete, ‘the merciful man,’ or to appropriate the <i>mercy</i>, ‘the mercy of God,” is to limit that which is purposely and weightily left unlimited, as an universal truth).<h2><u><b>14–26.]</u></h2></b> In close connexion with what has gone before, the Apostle sets forth that <i>bare faith without works can never save a man.</i> The following remarks of De Wette on the passage are important, and well condensed. They have been impugned by many, among whom are Neander, Schneckenburger, Theile, Thierseh, Hofmann: but they seem to me best to represent the simple and honest view of the matter, without any finessing to make the two Apostles in exact accord in their meaning of terms and their positions respecting them. “In order rightly to understand this polemical passage, it is necessary accurately to define St. James’s ideas of <i>faith</i>, of <i>works</i>, and of <i>justification</i>, and to compare them with those of St. Paul. <i>Faith</i> is, according to St. James, the result of the reception of the Word (ch. i. 22), especially in a moral point of view: <i>moral conviction</i> (Rom. xiv. 23): and although he recognizes it also as belief in Christ (ch. ii. 1), <i>as trust</i> (i. 6; v. 15), and <i>truth</i> (i. 3), yet he makes these particulars here of so little moment, that he regards it as <i>theoretical </i>belief only, and ascribes it to the evil spirits (ii. 19). Widely different from this is St. Paul’s idea of faith, which presupposes self-abasement, the feeling of unworthiness and incapability (Rom. iii. 9 ff., 23), and consists in trust on the grace of God revealed in the atoning death of Christ (Rom. iii. 25; v. 8; 2 Cor. v. 18 f.). Of this faith, moral faith is a branch (Rom. xiv. 23): but this latter, which is the adoption of the working principle of love (Gal. v. 6), can only spring from the purification of the inner man by faith in the atonement. So that it is impossible to say, as some have done, that the idea of faith in the two Apostles is the same. Works, according to St. James, are not the works of the law in the lower sense, the mere observance of, carnal ordinances and usages,—but an active life of practical morality, the rule of which is indeed found in the Mosaical law, and especially in the command to love one another, but so found, as apprehended, and appropriated by the spirit of liberty (see ch. i. 25; ii. 12). St. Paul also understands by ‘the works of the law’ not merely ceremonial observances, as plainly appears from Rom. vii. 14 ff.: but when he contends against the Jewish righteousness by works, and their pride, as in Rom. ix. 30 ff., he includes these observances in that to which he refers. As regards <i>justification</i>, St. James understands it in a <i>proper</i>, or moral sense (compare Matt. xii. 37), which St. Paul also recognizes. But in the latter Apostle’s idea of justification, we must distinguish a threefold point of view: 1) the general moral, at which he stops, Rom. ii. 13 (compare ib. ver. 5 ff.), taking no account, <i>how</i> the highest aim of morality, there indicated, is <i>to be</i> attained, and <i>is</i> attained: 2) In his polemical point of view, as combating Jewish righteousness by works, he denies that we can, by the fulfilment of the law (even of its moral part, seeing that no man fulfils it aright), attain justification or well-pleasingness to God (Rom. iii. 20; Gal. ii. 16). 3) In the third point of view also, in the Christian life itself, St. Paul recognizes the inadequacy of a good conscience to give peace aud blessedness to men (1 Cor. iv. 4), and<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VkOooiXfFQ8xuixWjUbjjUpd4R3_O42r/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This higher kind of justification, St. James does not recognize.” The whole question of fact, as to whether St. Paul’s teaching, or some misunderstanding of it, or neither the one nor the other, was in St. James’s view here, I have discussed in the Introduction, § iii. 5 ff. <h2><u><b>14.]</u></h2></b> <b>What is the profit</b> (arising from that to be mentioned: the resulting profit), <b>my brethren, if any</b> <b>man say</b> (there is no emphasis on the word <b>say, </b>as many have supposed: the whole argument proceeds on the hypothesis of his <i>possessing</i> faith: and in ver. 19, faith is actually ascribed to him. At the same time it is not to be wholly passed over, that the Apostle has written not “<i>have</i> faith,” but “<i>say he hath</i> faith.” While this does not imply any want of genuineness in the faith, it perhaps slightly distinguishes the possession of such faith from the absolute <i>having faith</i>: or, perhaps belongs to the dramatic form of the hypothesis, in which the man is introduced boasting of and appealing to his faith) <b>that he has faith, but have not works</b> (i. e. those acts in his lite which are proofs and fruits of faith: not mere ceremonial works: see De Wette’s remarks cited above)?

And the reason why this has been overlooked, is, the occurrence between the two of the general clause in ver. 17. The same mistaken person is in the Apostle’s view throughout, down to ver. 22: and it is as addressed to him, on the part of a chance objector to his inconsistency, that this saying is introduced: the <b>but</b> conveying the opposition of an objection not to the Apostle himself, but to him whom the Apostle is opposing. <h2><u><b>19.]</u></h2></b> Still addressed to the same advocate of faith only, but now directly, and not in the person of the speaker just introduced.

By the Apostle’s own comparison, ver. 26, faith is the body, obedience the spirit: faith without obedience is dead, until obedience, the spirit, sets faith in motion: then faith, like the limbs of the body, moves with and works with the acts of obedience.

It was not, until this, fulfilled, in the sense of being entirely exemplified and filled up. Wiesinger combats this sense as an unworthy one: no such objection as that which he brings [viz. that we make thus the truth of God’s saying depend on Abraham’s subsequent conduct] lies against our view, that the saying received on, and not till this occasion, its entire and full realization. It was true, when uttered: but it became more and more gloriously true of Abraham’s life and acts till it reached this its culminating point, in his chief act of self-denying obedience): <b>and he was called</b> (couple with <i>was fulfilled</i>, not with <i>was reckoned</i>) <b>God's friend</b> (i. e. ‘<i>loved by God</i>,’ not ‘<i>loving God</i>.’ This appellation of Abrabam is not found in the Septuagint.

Faith is unquestionably a thing spiritual: works are external and material : so that it would seem as if the members of the comparison should have been inverted, and works made the body, faith the spirit. But the Apostle’s view seems rather to be this: Faith is the body, the sum and substance, of the Christian life: works (obedience), the moving and quickening of that body; just as the spirit is the moving and quickening principle of the natnral body. So that as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is also dead.<h1><u><b>CHAP.

This would at once set aside all figurative explanations See the proposed meanings discussed in my Greek Test. The sense, <i>the whole orb</i> or <i>cycle of creation</i>, is that which I have seen cause to adopt: for other reasons, and because it fits well into the context. After the mention of the <i>orb of creation</i>, it is natural that the Apostle should take up, with the <b>for</b> (ver. 7), the details of creation, and assert that they might all be tamed by man, but that the tongue is untameable. Again, such sense is most agreeable to the similitude just used, of a small spark kindling a vast forest. The expression in the A. V., <b>the course of nature</b>, is sufficiently near the meaning, and expresses it in better English, perhaps, than any other); <b>and is itself set on fire</b> (in the original the verb is in the <i>present </i>tense, indicating that it is habitually, continually, so set on fire: see below) <b>by hell</b> (which is itself <i>the hell of fire</i>, in Matt. v. 22, and many other places. These words are not to be explained away: but are to be literally taken. It is the devil for whom hell is prepared, that is the tempter and instigator of the habitual sins of the tongue. It is out of the question [see above] to regard the sentence as alluding to the original temptations of the fall: equally so, to suppose it to have a future reference, and to imply that the tongue shall be tormented in hell: as some have done. Wiesinger says: “This passage reminds us, in its general sense, of the Old Test. sayings, Prov. xvi. 27; Ps. cxx. 2–4; Ecclus. xxviii. 11 ff.” This last clause is strikingly paralleled by the Targum on Ps. cxx. 2, where the deceitful tongue is compared with coals of juniper, which are set on fire in hell beneath. But none of these passages treats of the destruction which the tongue brings on its own body).<h2><u><b>7, 8.]</u></h2></b> <i>The untameableness of the tongue</i>.

But God is the Lord and husband of every soul that is His, as much as of every church; and the indignant <i>exclamation </i>of the Apostle is just as applicable to every one who forsakes his or her God, as to an apostate church.

We are married to one, even God, who has implanted in us His Spirit: and He is a jealous God, who will not suffer us to be friends of His enemy and His friends at the same time. The only difficulty seems to be, to trace this latter saying in any part of Scripture. I will state the solution which seems to me the most probable, and then give an account of other methods of solving it. The emphasis of this clause lies on the words <b>jealously desireth:</b> and, interpreting those words as above, we are naturally led to ask, is there any chapter or passage especially, where such a mind towards His people is ascribed to God? And this directs our thoughts at once to Deut. xxxii., where the love of Jehovah for Israel, and His jealousy over them is described. In that song of Moses we have this very word used of God, ver. 19–21. So that here we have the elements of the sense of that which is cited, viz. the jealous desire of the Lord over His people. And for the rest, “<i>the Spirit that He placed in us,</i>” the only solution seems to be, that the Apostle translates into the language of the Gospel the former declarations of the God of Israel, e.g. such as that Num. xxxv. 34, “<i>I the Lord dwell among the children of Israel,</i>” combining them with such prophecies as Ezek. xxxvi. 27, “<i>I will put my Spirit within you.</i>” I own that such a solution does not seem to me wholly satisfactory: still there is nothing improbable in the idea that St. James may have combined the general sense of Scripture on the point of God's jealousy over His people, and instead of the God who dwelt in Israel, may have placed the Holy Spirit who dwelleth in us. At all events it is better to understand it thus, than to force the words of the citation from their simple meaning. The statement of the other interpretations of this difficult verse would be quite unintelligible to an English reader. It will be found in my Greek Test. With regard to the sense above given, as fitting into the context, Theile well says, that it introduces us into the same figurative realm of thought in which the appellation “<i>adulteresses</i>” placed us before. The Apostle is speaking of the eager and jealous love of God those those whom He has united as it were in the bond of marriage with Himself.<h2><u><b>6.]</u></h2></b> <b>But He</b> (God, by His Holy Spirit dwelling in us, the same subject as<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wkXg4rn0w-i3U4nN4Q-AKb5lHfoaxFpL/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But it is only the pure in heart aud hand that can approach God: therefore—<b>Purify your hands</b> (the hands being the external organs of action, and becoming polluted by the act, as e. g. by blood in the act of murder: see Isa. i. 15, lix. 3: 1 Tim. ii. 8.

The Apostle is addressing not two classes of persons, but one and the same: the <i>sinners</i> are <i>double-minded</i>).<h2><u><b>9.]</u></h2></b> This cannot be done without <i>true and earnest repentance</i>, leading them through <i>deep sorrow</i>. <b>Be wretched</b> (in your minds, from a sense of your sinfulness. That such feeling will have its outward demonstrations is evident: but this word itself does not allude to them), <b>and mourn and weep</b> (here again, the exhortation does not regard outward things, as a mourning habit, or the like. These may follow on that which is here commanded, but are not the thing itself): <b>let your laughter be turned into mourning</b> (now he speaks rather of outward manifestations), <b>and your joy into humiliation </b>(literally, casting down of the eyes: hence shame or humiliation, which produces such downcast looks.

The latter gives more the realization in the soul of the presence of God, as drawing near to Him in humility: that, the subjection to Him in recognition of His providence and His judgments. <b>the Lord,</b> not Christ, but the Father: see on ch. i. 7), <b>and He shall exalt you</b> (both here and hereafter: by His grace and counsel here to the hidden glory of His waiting children, and by His fruition and presence hereafter to the ineffable glory of His manifested children; <b>in due time,</b> as 1 Pet. v. 6.

If on the other hand they are said of God, “it seems strange that after a change of reference from the preceding “<i>Him</i>,” another subject should be expressed in ch, iii. 1 by the words “<i>the Father</i>.” In consequence of these difficulties, some have referred <b>he is righteous</b> to Christ, and <i>of</i> <b>Him </b>to God; which cannot well be. It would be possible, doubtless, to understand the whole of Christ, without change of subject from ver. 28; and to leave the words <b>is born of Him</b> as we find them. If it occurs nowhere else in reference to Christ, there is in it nothing abhorrent from our Christian ideas. And in St. John’s sense of the intimate union between the Father and Son, he who is born of the Father might be said to be born of the Son also. But after all, the other view, which is that of most ancient expositors, must, I apprehend, be adopted. The analogy of the passage, as shewn in ch, iii. 1, 2, 9, 10, fixes the words <b>is born of Him</b> to birth from God: and the absence in the original of a new expressed subject in the words <i>is</i> <i>righteous </i>must be accounted for by remembering that this verse, as ch, i. 5, is the opening, and general statement, of a new section of the Epistle. And the essential unity of the Father and the Son comes in on this side also: so that the judgment alluded to ver. 28, which shall be executed by the Son, being judgment committed to Him by the Father, brings to mind the justice and righteousness in which that judgment is founded): <b>ye know that also every one who doeth righteousness</b> (literally, <b>the righteousness</b>, <br><br>i.e. the righteousness which is implied in the word “<i>righteous</i>” above: if it were not too strong, we might almost say, “that righteousness :” the article showing that there is no other. <b>doeth</b>, for all righteousness is energetic: it springs out of holiness, truth, love), <b>is born</b> (hath been begotten) <b>of Him</b> (God: see above: <i>for the righteous begetteth righteous progeny.</i> The inference here must be carefully kept to the Apostle’s words and obvious sense. And those require that we should understand it thus: God is <i>righteous</i>. This is our axiom, from which we set out, And if so, then the <i>source of</i> righteousness. When therefore a man doeth righteousness, <i>we know</i>, we apprehend, we collect, from our previous knowledge of these truths, that the source of his righteousness is God: that in consequence he has acquired by new birth from God, that righteousness which he had not by nature. We argue from his <i>doing righteousness</i> to his <i>having been begotten of God</i>. And the right apprehension of this is the more important because the whole mass of Socinian and Pelagian Commentators have reversed the members of the argument, and made it conclude that <i>doing</i> <i>righteousness </i>is the condition, on our part, of <i>becoming </i>a child of God. And the Roman-Catholic expositors, while they avoid this error, yet go equally wrong, in understanding “<i>hath been begotten</i>” not as the statement of a past and abiding fact, but as the ground of a confidence as to the future).<h1><u><b>CHAP. I. 1–10.</b>]</u></h1> <i>The true and distinguishing signs of the children of God and the children of the devil</i>. <h2><u><b>1–3.</b>]</u></h2> The foundation and source of all righteousness in us is, the essential righteousness of God. All our doing of righteousness is a mere sign that He has begotten us anew— that we are His children. And what great things are contained in this name—how precious treasures of faith, of hope, of love! On this thought the Apostle now enters. He places the whole glory of the children of God before his readers. The being righteous as He is righteous, is the token of that new birth, and the measure of the life which began with it: the striving to perfect and mature this token, to fill up this measure, is an additional proof that a man is of God. <h2><u><b>1.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Behold </b>(as in John i. 29; xix. 5, does not express the Writer’s own astonishment, but directs the attention of those who are addressed. But there immediately follows upon us, the communicative address, so that in fact the Apostle does in a manner include himself among those addressed in <b>behold</b>), <b>what manner of </b>(including “how great,” “how free,” “how precious”—in fact, all the particulars which are afterwards brought out respecting this love: see ver. 16, ch. iv. 9, 16) <b>love </b>(is <b>love </b>here, joined as it is with the verb “<i>hath bestowed</i>,”<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E5-1GtaNfCJMl4VtdwMqLgOu25K4Yd0a/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

There seems no necessity for diverting the word from its proper meaning. As in ch. iv. 9, the proof of the love is that which is imported, not by the love itself, but by the verb joined with it; as by “<i>was manifested</i>” there, so by “<i>hath bestowed</i>” here) <b>the Father</b> (spoken here not, as some think, of God in general, the whole three Persons in the blessed Trinity, but personally, of the Father, as distinguished from the Son, in whom we have received our adoption) <b>hath given</b> (see above) <b>unto us, that</b> (how is <b>that </b>here to be taken ? is it to be kept to its strong sense, indicating that our being called the children of God is the <i>purpose </i>of that gift of love just spoken of, or does it, as so often in St. John, introduce the <i>purport </i>of that love, stated in the form of an end to be gained by its manifestation ? Lücke and others keep the strong telic sense. “What great love,” says Lücke, “hath the Father shewn us [viz, in sending His Son, ch. iv. 10], <br><br>in order to make us children of God!” But the objection to this is, that thus a proof of the divine Love is hinted at in our verse which is not, expanded, but is left to be gathered from elsewhere : and the purpose introduced by <b>that </b>becomes the secondary and remote subject of the sentence, whereas, from the idea of <b>children of God</b> taking up the preceding idea of <i>birth from God</i>, and being again taken up in ver. 2, it is evidently the primary subject. The other meaning is taken by the ancient Greek expositors ; “wbat manner of love . . . resulting in, proved by, our being, &c.” The effect of the love, that at which it is aimed in its immediate bestowal, is, that we should be called children of God: its ultimate purpose is another thing. See vv. 11, 23, where we have the same construction) <b>we</b> <b>should be called children of God</b> (why has the Apostle rather used <b>should be called</b> than “<i>should be?</i>” Probably to bring forward the title, the reality of which, notwithstanding its non-recognition by the world, he is about to assert immediately). <b>And WE ARE [so]: for this cause the world</b> <b>doth not know</b> (apprehend, recognize) us; <b>because it did not know Him </b>(viz. Christ. —The insertion of the words, <b>and we are so</b>, appears to serve the purpose of bringing out the reality of the state conferred upon us with this title, in spite of any non-recognition of it by the unbelieving world. This clause is of the highest possible significance. On its assertion depends the <b>therefore </b>which follows: and we ARE God’s children : for <i>this very reason</i>, because we bear not the name only but the essence, the world knows us not: and then, as a reason for this ignorance following on this reality of our derivation from Him,—because it knew Him not. The reality of a believer's sonship of God, and his non-recognition by the world, are thus necessarily connected together. But Whom did the world not know, and when? <b>Him </b>here, by the very requirements of the logic of the passage, must be the Father, who not being recognized, neither are His children ; Augustine and others understand <i>Christ</i>. But this can only be, if we understand that the world rejected that revelation of the Father which was made by Christ His Son. And if we introduce this element, we disturb the strictness of the argument. It is the world’s ignorance of God, considered as one great act of non-recognition, disobedience, rebellion, hate, which makes them incapable of recognizing, loving, sympathizing with, those who are veritably children of God: compare ch. v. 1).<h2><u><b>2.</b>]</u></h2><b> Beloved, now are we children of God </b>(the world recognizes ns not: but our sonship is real: none the less real, that we ourselves know not our future condition in all its manifestation. So that the next member of the sentence is introduced not with a <i>“but,”</i> but with an <i>“and:”</i> the two are not contrasted, but simply put in juxtaposition as components of our present state, We are really sons of God, even <i>now:</i> and we look [this very word <i>“now”</i> suggesting a future] for an inheritance in virtue of that sonship: it has not been yet manifested of what sort that inheritance shall be: thus much we know, &e.

But we must take care not to fall into Grotius’s error, “in what manner we are to be the sons of God:” for as Calovius rightly remarks, “there are no degrees of sonship :” we are as truly, and in the same sense, children of God now, as we shall be then: but now [Gal. iv. 1] we are children waiting for an unknown inheritance—then we shall be children in full possession of that inheritance, And hence, from the reality and identity of that sonship, come what follows, —our certain knowledge, even in this absence of manifestation in detail, that our future condition will consist in likeness to Him). <b>We know</b> (no contrast, though <i>“but”</i> is required to fill out our English idiom: see above : what we know of this <i>what we shall be,</i> is this.

V.: Tyndale and Cranmer had <i>“it”</i>), and others, supply <i>“He,”</i> understanding <i>Christ:</i> appealing to St. John’s well-known usage which we have in ch. ii. 28, and below in our ver. 5. But it may be replied, that in the former case the subject was plainly suggested by the preceding words <i>“in Him,”</i> in the latter actually expressed : whereas here the reference of the verb is no less plainly given by the preceding verb, here again repeated. Besides which, <i>“He,” </i>in ver. 5, clearly shews that the divine subject of these verses is not Christ but the Father), <b>we shall be</b> (taken up again from above, and the emphatic <b>like Him </b>corresponding exactly to <b>what</b> above) <b>like Him </b>(<i>God:</i> see below), <b>because </b> (this connecting particle must be kept firm to its causal meaning, and all the difficulties of the sentence met thus, not by explaining it away. Nor does it express merely the <i>mode </i>of the transformation, as Lyra. Still less must we with Calvin and others reverse the causal connexion, and make the seeing Him as He is merely a proof that we shall be like Him. Whatever consequences it may entail, it is certain that the proposition introduced by <i>because </i>contains the real essential cause and ground of that which it follows) <b>we shall see Him</b> (God : see below) <b>as He is </b>(with St. John, the recognition and knowledge of God is ever no mere cognition, but the measure of the spiritual life: he who has it, possesses God, has the Father and the Son: becomes more and more like God, having His seed in him. So that the full and perfect accomplishment of this knowledge in the actual fruition of God Himself must of necessity bring with it entire likeness to God. And this is the part of the future lot of the sons of God which is certain. Because we shall see Him as He is, —which is taken for granted as a Christian axiom,—it of necessity follows that we shall be entirely like Him: ethically like Him: we shall behold, as Ecumenins says, “the just, the just One—the pure, the pure One.” The difficulty, that no man can see God, is not in reality contained here, any more than it is in our Lord’s “ Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall <i>see </i>God.” The word, however understood, has for its limit, that no created eye even in the glorified body can behold the Creator: that beyond its keenest search there will be glory and perfection baffling and dazzling it: but this incapacity does not prevent the vision, as far as it can reach, being clear and unclouded: being, to the utmost extent of which our glorified nature is capable, <i>as He is</i>—a true and not a false vision of God. And if it be again objected that we seem to be thus confounding the ethical sight of God which is the measure of our likeness to God, with corporeal sight of Him in the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CsSZfBJ_XWc0HROouyPlPCJePsm-LjZy/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

We are speaking of things which eye hath not seen, nor mind conceived: what a <i>spiritual body </i>may imply, our ideas now do not enable us to conceive: but I suppose it must at all events be a body, all of whose senses are spiritually conditioned and attuned : that what <i>physical capacities</i> are to our bodies here, <i>spiritual capacities</i> will be there: and feeling this, however little I may know of the details of the great fact, it removes from me all insuperable difficulty as to the words <i>“we shall see Him as </i>He <i>is.”</i> “I know that in my flesh I shall see God,” may not be the right expression in Job, but it is the expression of my hopes as a son of God: it is the one expression of a hope in which all other hopes culminate and centre. And every son of God knows, that for it ever to be fulfilled, he must be growing onward in likeness to Him, pure, even up into His purity: for in His light only shall we see light.<br><br>One point only must be noticed before passing onward; the fact that several of the great interpreters understand <b>Him </b>both times of <i>Christ</i>. This has partly of course been occasioned by their supplying Christ as a subject to the verb <i>“shall appear,”</i> or <i>“shall be manifested,”</i> above. Augustine has one of his most beautiful passages, explaining how at Christ’s appearing, the impious shall see only <i>the form of a servant</i>, but we <i>the form of God</i>. The whole view, however, does not satisfy the requirements of the passage. It is the<i> children of God</i> who are addressed : and the topic of exhortation is, that they be righteous as God their Father is righteous).<b> </b><h2><u><b>3.</b>]</u></h2><b> And every one that hath this hope </b>(viz. that of being like Him hereafter) <b>on Him </b>(i.e. rested and grounded on God. In God, and grounded on His promises, is all our hope), <b>purifieth himself</b> (these words are not to be taken in any Pelagian sense, as if a man could of himself purify himself: “apart from me,” says our Lord, “ye can do nothing.” John xv.5. The man who purifies himself has this hope resting upon God. This mere fact implies a will to purify himself, not out of, nor independent of, this hope, but ever stirred up by, and accompanying it. So that the will is not his own, sprung out of his own nature, but the result of his Christian state, in which God also ministers to him the power to carry out that will in self-purification, See 2 Cor. vii. 1, which is remarkably parallel: and 1 Pet. i. 21, 22. The idea is much the same as that in ch. i. 9: it is entire purification, not merely from unchastity, but from all defilement of flesh and spirit), <b>even as He is pure</b> (Who is intended by <b>He? </b>Clearly below in ver. 5, Christ, from the facts of the case. But is it as clear here? Almost all the modern Commentators assume it, and the inference is upheld by a first view of ch. ii, 6, where much the same expression is used, and used of Christ. But there are some weighty considerations against the view. First, it is the <i>Father</i>, of whom it is written, “Be ye holy, for [or as] I am holy,” 1 Pet. i. 15, 16, Levit. xi. 44, xix. 2: compare also Matt. v. 48. Secondly, it would be very harsh thus to introduce a new subject, in the face of this Scripture usage. Thirdly, it would be against the whole spirit of the context: in which sonship of God and likeness to God are joined together, and the hopes belonging to the state are made motives for the duty. Fourthly, if it be asserted that Christ is our Pattern, in whom we see the Father’s purity shewn forth; I answer that this would be perfectly intelligible, if allusion was made, as in ch. ii. 6, to some historical manifestation in our Lord’s life: but being as it is in the present tense, it refers to the essential divine attribute of purity: and if so, then to that attribute in ary inherence in the Father. For these reasons and others which may be seen in my Greek Testament, I would interpret <b>He </b>here of the Father, in whom essentially abides this perfection of purity, and after continual increase of likeness to whom his sons, having the ultimate hope of being completely like Him, will be striving. In ver. 5, the case is otherwise : see there, and also on ver. 7).<h2><u><b>4-10</b>]</u></h2> T<i>he irreconcilability of sin with the work of redemption, with communion with Christ, and with being born of God.</i> The difficulty has been, to mark distinctly the connexion with the foregoing.

Now, the Apostle comes to treat its negative side: the incompatibility of sin with birth-from-God. And this he deals with essentially and in the ideal, as always. The whole is in the closest connexion with the foregoing, and is developed step by step with the minutest precision, as will be seen in the exegesis.<h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> In this verse we have verse 3 taken ap from the opposite side. There, God’s essential purity formed a law, according to which the child of God having hope of ultimate complete likeness to Him, purifies himself. Here we have it declared that the sinner goes counter to [this and all other] law: indeed the two terms, sin and lawlessness, are synonymous and convertible. <b>Every one that committeth sin, </b> <b>also committeth transgression-of-law: and sin</b> (abstract and in general) <b>is transgression-of-law </b>(abstract and in general. The assertion amounts to the identification of the terms, and the <b>is </b>amounts to “is equivalent to.”<br><br>This being so, <i>what is it exactly that our verse asserts</i> respecting these two things, sin, and transgression-of-law ? First and obviously, no appropriation must be made, in this verse and throughout this passage, of the word <b>sin </b>to <i>one kind </i>of sin, whether it be mortal sin as distinguished from venial [so the Roman-Catholic expositors], or notorious and unrepented sins, or sins against brotherly love [as Luther, and Augustine]. The assertions are all perfectly general, and regard, in the true root and ideal, every sin whatever. Every sin whatever then is a transgression of God’s law : as indeed its very name in Greek implies: <i>to sin </i>being to <i>miss a mark</i>, and the mark being that will of God which is the <i>law </i>and <i>aim </i>to him who “doeth the will of God,” ch. ii. 17).<h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2><i> Additional argument </i>for the incompatibility of sin with the life of God’s children: that He, Christ, in and by whom we have this adoption (John i. 12), and by being in whose likeness alone we can be perfectly like God, was manifested to take away all sins, being Himself sinless. <b>And ye know </b>(the Apostle assumes it as known by those who had an anointing from the Holy One and knew all things ch. ii. 20) <b>that He</b> (now clearly Christ, from the context, which [see above on ver. 3] can alone decide the reference in each case) <b>was manifested</b> (viz. by His appearing in the flesh, and all that He openly and visibly did and taught in it, or may be known, by the Spirit, to have done and taught) <b>in order that He may </b>[might] <b>take away </b>(in the original, “take away by one act and entirely.” The meaning, <i>“take away,”</i> and not <i>“bear,”</i> is necessitated here by the context. Sin is altogether alien from Christ. He became incarnate that He might blot it out: He has no stain of it on Himself, If we render the word <i>“bear,”</i> this coherence is lost. Of course this fact is in the background, that He took them away by bearing them Himself: but it is not brought out, only the antagonism between Him and sin. See, on the word, the note on John i. 29) <b>sins </b>(<i>all</i> sins, not merely certain sins. The object of His manifestation is stated not only categorically, but definitively. Compare the striking parallel, Heb. ix. 26): <b>and in Him sin is not </b>(as His work, in being manifested, was, altogether to take away sin, so likewise is He himself free from all spot of sin. On the perversions and misunderstandings of this verse by the rationalists, and by Calvin, see in my Greek Test.).<h2><u><b>6.</b>]</u></h2> The connexion see above. <b>Every one that abideth in Him </b>(this expression is not to be weakened down by any rationalistic interpretation a<i>s believing in Christ</i>, or <i>being joined in love to Christ. </i>This a man might be to an earthly friend : but could not be said to <i>abide in him</i>.

This all the best and deepest Commentators have felt: so Augustine and Bede, saying, “In so far as he abideth in Him, he sinneth not.” The two are incompatible: and in so far as a man is found in the one, he is thereby separated from the other. In the child of God i the hatred of sin; in the child of the devil the love of it; and every act done in virtue of either state or as belonging to either, is done purely on one side or purely on the other. If the child of God falls into sin, it is an act against nature, deadly to life, hardly endured, and bringing bitter repentance: it is as the taking of a poison, which if it be not corrected by its antidote, will sap the very springs of life. So that there is no real contradiction to ch. i, 8–10, ii. 2, where this very falling into sin of the child of God is asserted and the remedy prescribed. The real difficulty of our verse is in that which follows); <b>every one that sinneth hath not seen </b>(so literally : see below) <b>Him, neither hath known Him </b>(here it seems to be said that the act of sinning not only <i>so far </i>excludes from the life in God and Christ, but proves that that life h<i>as never existed </i>in the person so sinning. That this cannot be the meaning of the Apostle, is evident from such passages as i. 8–10, ii. 2, and indeed from the whole tenor of the Epistle, in which the words, <i>“now are we children of God,” </i> occur in combination with<br><br><i>“let no one deceive you,”</i> and the like: whereas if the above view were correct, the very fact of <i>being deceived</i> not only would cause them to cease from being <i>children of God</i>, but would prove that they never had been such. If then this cannot be so, what meaning are we to put upon the words? First observe the tense in which the verbs stand in the original. They are perfects, almost equivalent to our English present, by which I have accordingly rendered them. And the meaning will be, that the cutting off by an act of sin of the sight and knowledge of Christ, shews, and shews in proportion as it prevails, unreality in that sight and knowledge. See the force of the tense discussed in my Greek Testament.<br><br>As regards the relation of the words themselves, <b>seeth </b>and <b>knoweth</b>; some hold that there is no perceptible difference : but that the latter word fixes and specifies the necessarily figurative meaning of the former. Lücke would understand <i>“seeing” </i>of knowledge obtained by historical information, which matures and completes itself into <i>“knowing.”</i> But this seems hardly according to St. John’s practice, who uses <i>“seeing”</i> either of bodily sight [John i. 18, 1 John i. 1, &c., &c.],— or of an intuitive immediate vision of divine things, such as Christ has of the Father and heavenly things [John iii. 11, 32, vi. 46, viii. 38],—or of spiritual intuition gained by knowledge of Christ and the divine life [John xiv. 7, 9; 3 John 11]: and there can be little doubt that this last is the meaning here: and thus <b>neither </b>will retain its proper exclusive and climacteric force:<i> seeing</i> is a further step than <i>knowing </i>: a realization of Christ's personality and of the existence of heavenly things which is the result of spiritual knowledge: and thus the sinner “hath not seen Him, nor yet, nor even, known Him”).<h2><u><b>7, 8.</b>]</u></h2> <i>The contrast is again stated</i>, and introduced by a solemn warning not to be misled respecting it : and, as usually<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hXDKc_lVWdBdxzyqDZ_fBcMM6tKWt756/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This is altogether to invert the proposition of the Apostle, who is reasoning, not from the fact of doing good works to the conclusion that a man is righteous, but from the hypothesis of a man’s being a child of God, born of Him and like Him, to the necessity of his purifying himself and doing righteousness. And in doing this, he ascribes the <i>doing righteousness</i> to its source, and the <i>doing sin</i> to its source : the one man is of God, the other is of the devil. As Luther well says, “ Good works of piety do not make a good pious man, but a good pious man does good pious works. ... Fruits grow from the tree, not the tree from fruits.”<h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Contrast to ver.7</i>. He that doeth sin is of the devil (notice first “<i>he that</i> <b>doeth </b>[not, as the A. V. most unfortunately, ‘committeth”) sin,” as indicative not s0 much of individual acts as of a state, corresponding to <i>“he that doeth righteousness.”</i> And then the words, is of the <b>devil</b>, must not be rationalized away, as is done by those who deny the personal existence of the devil. It is the distinct opposite correlative of “is of God” [ver. 10, &c.], and implies a personal root and agency, just as much as that other does. But again, it does not imply any physical dualism on the part of the Apostle, “The devil made no one, begat no one, created no one,” says Augustine here; “but he who imitates the devil, as if born of him, becomes a son of the devil, by imitation, not by birth. All sinners are born of the devil, in so far as they are sinners. Adam was made by God: but when he consented to the devil, he was born of the devil, and begat all such as he himself was.” But be it observed, that we have here no such expression as <i>“hath been begotten of the devil,”</i> but only, <i>is </i>of the devil. In the case of the children of God, there is a definite time, known to Him, when they passed from death unto life [ch. ii. 29; iii, 14; v. 11; John i. 12; iii. 3 ff.; v. 24, &c.]: from which their new life unto God dates: but there is no such point in the life of those who are the children of the devil; no regeneration from beneath corresponding to that from above : the natural life of men is not changed hy seed of the devil as it is by seed of God. Rather may we say, that in those who are of the devil this latter change has never taken place. Since sin has come to reign in the world by man’s sin, our natural birth, which is properly and essentially a birth from God, a creation by the eternal Word, has become a birth from the devil: so that it is, as Bengel expresses it, “a, corruption, not a generation:” and there is no trace of a physical dualism in St. John’s doctrine: nay, the idea is at once precluded by the fact, that according to the Apostle [John i. 12] those who are children of God have become so from having been children of the devil): <b>because the devil sinneth from the beginning </b>(‘sinned in the beginning, and has never ceased to sin since.’ But the question meets us, what is <b>from the beginning?</b> Bede and others understand it of the beginning of all creation. Many Commentators, to avoid all chance of dualism, make it mean not from the time of his creation, but from that of his fall, understanding it of the beginning <i>of our world</i>. But again, others suppose the term to mark the beginning of the devil’s own apostacy : so Bengel, &c. And lastly, others again take it to mean, “from the time when any began to sin.” And this seems, when we compare John viii. 44, to be the true interpretation.

See on this subject, my Sermons on Divine Love, Serm. v. pp. 68 ff, “the First Sinner”). <b>To this end was the Son of God manifested</b><br><br>(viz. in His incarnation, pregnant with all its consequences), <b>that He might destroy</b> (do away, break up, pull down: the word is used of a building, or a law, or an organized whole) <b>the works of the devil</b> (what are these? Clearly, in the first place, works whereof the devil is the <i>author</i>: not merely <i>devilish works</i>. And then, are we to include in the list not only sins, which manifestly belong to it, but also the consequences of sin—pain, sorrow, death? The <i>fact </i>would be true if we did: for Christ hath abolished death [2 Tim. i. 10]. But the context seems to require that we should at all events keep death and the results of sin in the background, as no mention is made of them here, and sinful works are clearly in the Apostle’s mind. These works the whole <i>manifestation </i>of Christ. went directly to nullify: more especially His Death, in which His power over Satan reached its highest point,—the bruising of His heel, in which He bruised the Enemy’s head:—for it was in that, that He won for us that acceptance which is sealed by His glorification, and in virtue of which the Holy Spirit is given us, of whose work in us it is said that we<i> “by the Spirit mortify (put to death) the deeds of the body.”</i> Rom. viii. 13).<h2><u><b>9, 10.</b>]</u></h2> <i>The contrast taken up again</i>, and from the converse: he that is born of God cannot sin: he that does not righteousness, is not of God: i.e. is a child of the devil. Then we have the usual new particular, to give the transition note to that which is to follow,— including in this last category him that loveth not his brother. <b>Every one that is begotten of God, doeth not sin </b>(the meaning of this declaration has been treated of above, ver. 6. Here we meet it in its barest and plainest form—the two states, being begotten of God, and sin, absolutely excluding one another), <b>because His seed abideth in him </b>(i. e. because that new principle of life from which his new life has unfolded, which was God’s seed deposited in him, abides growing there, and precludes the development of the old sinful nature. Some of the ancients understood it of the <i>word</i> of God, as in the parable of the sower, Matt. xiii, 3 ff. This last interpretation has been impugned by all the moderns, but I cannot see that they have mado good their objection: the force of which amounts to this ; that the word of God is not so much the <i>Seed</i>, as <i>the means whereby the begetting to the new life takes place</i>. But whether we regard the generation of plants, or animal procreation, which latter is more in question here, what words can more accurately describe the office of the seed than these? and what is the word of God but the continually abiding and working seed of the new life, in the child of God? Nay, it seems to be that exactly of which we are in search: not the Holy Spirit, the personal agent; not the power of the new life, the thing begotten; but just that which intervenes between the two, the word, the utterance of God—dropped into the soul of man, taking it up by divine power into itself, and developing the new life continually. This is in the most precise and satisfactory sense the<i> seed of God</i> : and on this all Scripture symbolism is agreed: compare 1 Pet. i. 23, James i. 18. In fact the very passage which is the key to this, is John v. 38, “ <i>Ye have not His word abiding in you</i>.” Nor should any exception have been taken to the comparison with the parable of the Sower, for though the attendant circumstances of generation are different, the analogy is the same); <b>and he cannot sin</b> (no explaining away of this declaration must be at- tempted, as is done by Cornelins-a-lapide, who understands it of <i>deadly </i>sin; by Augustine and Bede, who confine the <i>to</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SVnyl30HbnCNez5_ZfVJ8P2cwdJNo6gJ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The Apostle is speaking not only of the ideal, but of the real state of those born of God: drawing the strongest possible contrast between the life of God and the life of sin, as excluding one another absolutely. And there is no contradiction between what is here said and ch. i. 8, 9; nay, rather that passage shews, by the strong desire to he cleansed from all sin, which it assumes, the same incompatibility as is here insisted on), <b>because he hath been begotten of God</b> (almost all the expositors, from the first times until now, make this <b>because</b> more or less represent <i>in as far as, or as long as</i>. It is true, the Apostle does not say, <i>“he cannot sin because he </i><b>was born</b> <i>of God:”</i> this would testify to a past fact, once for all occurring, without any reference to its present permanence: but he has said because he is [<b>hath been and continues</b>] <b>born</b>,—because he <i>has abiding in him</i> that his birth from God. So that the above-cited explanation, though falling far short of the real meaning, has at least a feeling after the truth of the Apostle’s assertion in it. The abiding force of this divine generation in a man, excludes sin: where sin enters, that force does not abide: the <i>having been born</i> is in danger of becoming a mere fact in the past, instead of a fact in the present: a lost life, instead of a living life. And so all such passages as this, instead of testifying, as Calvin would have this one do, to the doctrine of final perseverance of the regenerate, do in fact bear witness to the very opposite: viz., that, as the Church of England teaches, we need God’s special grace every day to keep us in the state of salvation, from which every act and thought of sin puts us in peril of falling away. <br><br>Before leaving this important passage, I must quote Düsterdieck’s concluding remarks. “The difference between the older and more modern expositors lies in this, that the former are more anxious to moderate the details of the Apostle’s sentiment, and to tone down his assertion. to the actual life of Christians, while the moderns recognize the full precision of the text as it stands, but then remind us that the ideal truth of the principle announced by St. John continually, so to speak, floats above the actual life of believers as their role and aim, and that, in so far, the Apostle’s saying finds in such actual life only a relative fulfilment. None however of all the expositors, who in any way has recognized the ideal character of St. John’s view, has overlooked the fact, that even in the actual life of all that are born of God there is something which in fall verity answers to the ideal words, ‘they cannot sin,’ The children of God, in whom the divine seed of their eternal life abides, have, in reality, a holy privilege,—they sin not, and they cannot sin, just in proportion as the new divine life, unconditionally opposed to all sin, and manifesting itself in godlike righteousness, is present and abides in them. Expositors of all theological tendencies, in all times, point to this, that the new life of believers, veritably begotten by regeneration from God, is simply incompatible with sin;— the life which essentially alienates the spirit from all sin, fills it with an irreconcilable hate against every sin, and urges it to an unceasing conflict against all unrighteousness. Luther excellently says, that a child of God in this conflict receives indeed wounds daily, but never throws away his arms or makes peace with his deadly foe. Sin is ever active, but no longer dominant: the normal direction of life’s energies in the believer is against sin, is an absence of sin, a no-will-to-sin and a no-power-to-sin. He that is born of God has become, from being a servant of sin, a servant of righteousness : according to the divine seed remaining in him, or, as St. Paul says, according to the inner man [Rom. vii. 15 ff.], he will, and he can work only that which is like God,— righteousness, though the flesh, not yet fully mortified, rebels and sins: so that even in and by the power of the new life sin must be ever confessed, forgiveness received [ch. i. 8 ff.], the temptation of the evil one avoided and overcome [v. 18], and self-purification and sanctification carried on”). <h2><u><b>10.</b>]</u></h2> <i>The continuation of the former argument:</i> with the insertion, in the latter half, of the new particular which is to form the argument of the next section.

Socinus remarks well, “From the Apostle’s words it may clearly enough be collected, that between the sons of God and the sons of the devil there are none intermediate”): <b>every one that doeth not righteousness </b>(see ch. ii. 29) <b>is not of God</b> (is not a child of God), <b>and he that loveth not his brother</b> (see below, these words pointing on to the next section).<h2><u><b>11–24.</b>]</u></h2> Of <i>brotherly love</i>, as the sum and essence of <i>righteousness</i>: as Christ’s command [ver. 11]: whereas in the world there is hate [12, 13]: bound up with life, as hate with death [14, 15]: finding its great pattern in Christ [16]; to be testified not in word only but in deed [17, 18]; as the ground of confidence toward God and the granting of our prayers to Him, being obedience to His will [19–22]; which obedience consists in faith and love [23], and is testified to by the witness of His Spirit [24].<br><br>Before entering on ver. 11, the latter half of ver. 10 must be considered, as belonging properly, in its sense, to this section, though in arrangement inseparable from the last. The <i>“and,”</i> which binds on the additional particular in the last clause, serves, as in ver. 5, to co-ordinate that clause with the foregoing : not in this case as excluded from the forementioned category, but as one in particular, taken out from among the general category, and put into a co-ordinate position with it. And it is thus put, as being the most eminent, and most of the nature of a summary, and criterion, of the rest, of any of those graces which are necessarily involved in <i>righteousness</i>. Augustine beautifully says, “Love alone distinguishes between the children of God and the children of the devil. All may sign themselves with the sign of cross of Christ: all may answer Amen: all may sing Halleluia: all may be baptized, may enter churches, may build the walls of the same: but the children of God are not distinguished from the children of the devil, except by Love.” And this love, thus constituted into the great test and touchstone, is necessarily the family love of brother for brother within the limits of those who are begotten of God. Universal love to man is a Christian grace —but it is not that here spoken of: it neither answers the description of the <i>“message”</i> given in ver. 11, nor corresponds to the context here in general, the drift of which is that a test of our belonging to God’s family is our love towards His children, who are our brethren in that family: cf. ch. v. 1 ff. But, while there can be no doubt that this is the right understanding of the brotherly love here insisted on, we incur at once a formal difficulty in applying this meaning to the negative or exclusive side of the test. He who does not love his brother, has in strict fact <i>no brother to love</i>, for he is not a child of God at all. Hence we must understand, strictly speaking, <i>“his brother”</i> in this case as importing his hypothetical brother : him who would be, were he himself a true child of God, a brother, and, if so, necessarily beloved. That this love does not exist in him, demonstrates him not to be of God’s family.<h2><u><b>11.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Because </b>(proof that absence of love of the brethren excludes from God's family)<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N2atX4SJcbzSxljOmkanhPhTE4LoJhlN/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In the words <b>was of the wicked one</b> we have a resumption of the expression <i>“is of the devil”</i> from above, ver. 8: the word <b>wicked</b> being used probably on account of his being <i>of the wicked one</i> following. Observe, “his works were wicked” is the inference from that great proof which he gave of it by killing his brother: as is also the reason given in what follows: see below. So that here the assertion of his being of the wicked one is, aa above, strictly ethical, aud in no way physical or dualistic: “Cain was the son not of God but of the devil, <i>not by generation</i>, but by imitation and suggestion.” Cornclius-a-lapide). <b>And for what reason slew he him? because his [own] works were wicked, and those of his brother righteous</b> (it has caused some difficulty, that no mention of this ethical difference is made in the narrative in Genesis. It has been supposed that the Apostle gathers it from God’s differing acceptance of the offerings of the two: others have culled the ethical characters of the two the <i>previous</i> occasion, whereas the immediately exciting cause was the deduction from acknowledged facts, of the murder. But properly considered, the Apostle’s assertion here is only a <i>proximate </i>occasion. Cain murdered his brother: therefore he hated him: and hate belongs to the children of the evil one,— classes him at once among those whose works are evil, and who hate those who, like Abel, are testified to [Heb, xi. 4] that they are of the children of God who work righteousness. Whatever might. be the exciting occasion of the murder, this lay at the root —the hatred which the children of the devil ever bear to the children of God).<h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> The connexion with ver. 12 is close: the world (the children of the devil) began so, and will ever go on as it began. <b>Marvel not, brethren, if</b> (no <i>doubt </i>is expressed by this <i>if</i>. The hypothesis is set forth as actually fulfilled) <b>the world hateth you</b> (this verse is in close sequence on the example just given: Cain being taken as the prototype and exemplar of such hate).<h2><u><b>14, 15.</b>]</u></h2> See summary above, on ver. 11. The connexion with the foregoing is very close. We learnt from ver. 10, that the love of the brethren is that which makes manifest the children of God and the children of the devil. And now again, having spoken of the hate of the world as a thing to be looked for, the Apostle brings up this sign as one tending to comfort the child of God, and shew him that, notwithstanding the world’s hate, he has more to rejoice at than to fear from the fact: he is in life, they in death. <b>We</b> (emphatic: we whom the world hates: we, as set over against the world) <b>know </b>(see above, ver. 2: of <i>certain </i> knowledge) <b>that we have passed over out of death into life</b> (in the original it is, <b>out of the death into the life</b>—<i>the death</i>, which reigns over the unregenerate: <i>the life</i>, which is revealed in Christ), <b>because</b> (gives the ground and cause, not of the <i>having passed over</i>, but of the <i>knowledge</i> of having passed over) <b>we love the brethren</b> (here distinctly, our Christian brethren: the term being that well-known one<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-k3m4JtxaJ_Oz0jQZjfgebhvvDpIuBwi/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

For the Romanist and Socinian distortions of this verse, curiously running into one, see note in my Greck Test. It may conduce to a right estimate of the doctrines of men and churches, and put younger Scripture students on their guard, to see the concurrent habits and tendencies of interpreters apparently so opposite. When Pilate and Herod are friends, we know what work is in hand. But as a conclusion, I will quote the clear and faithful exposition of a greater and better man: “What do we know? that we have passed from death into life. Whence have we this knowledge? because we love the brethren. Let no one interrogate a man: let every one have recourse to his own heart: if he find there brotherly love, he may be sure that he has passed from death into life. He stands already on the right hand: let it not trouble him that as yet his glory is hidden; when the Lord shall come, then shall he appear in glory. For he is growing, but as yet in winter: the root grows, but the branches are as it were dried up: within is the sap which grows, within are the leaves of trees, within are fruits, but they wait for summer”); <b>he that loveth not</b> (there is this time no qualifying object, as <i>“his brother:”</i> the absence of love from the character is the sign spoken of), <b>abideth in death </b>(as before, <i>“in the death:”</i> in that realm of death, in which all men are by nature. Here again the absence of love is not the reason, why he remains in death; but the sign of his so remaining, The <i>“passing over”</i> has not passed upon him. The words have no reference to <i>future</i> death, any further than as he who is and abides in death can but end in death: we may notice that he docs not say, he who loveth not shall come into death, as if he were speaking concerning eternal punishment, awaiting sinners in the future: but he says, <i>“he who loveth not abideth in death.”</i> Bede). <h2><u><b>15.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Every one that hateth his brother is a manslayer</b> (in these words, (1) <i>“he that loveth not,”</i> which preceded, is taken up by <b>every one that hateth</b>: shewing that the two are identical: the living spirit of man being incapable of a state of indifference: that he who has banished brotherly love has in fact abandoned himself to the rule of the opposite state. In the ethical depth of the Apostle’s view, love and hate, like light and darkness, life and death, necessarily succeed, as well as necessarily exclude, one another. He who has not the one of necessity has the other in each case. (2) he who hates his brother is stated to be a <i>manslayer</i>. The example given, ver. 12, shewed the true and normal result of hate: and again in the Apostle’s ethical depth of view, as in our Lord's own [ Matt. v. 21 ff, 27 fi.], he who falls under a state, falls under the normal results of that state carried out to its issue. If a hater be not a murderer, the reason does not lie in his hate, but in his <i>lack</i> <i>of </i>hate. “Whom we hate, we wish destroyed,” says Calvin. Some would make a <i>manslayer </i>mean, a destroyer of <i>his own</i> soul. But this, as well as the view that it is the murder of his brother’s <i>soul</i> which is intended, by provoking him to anger and discord,—errs by pressing the reference to the example of Cain above. Some again would interpret it by a reference to John viii. 44, understood as pointing to the ruin of Adam by the Tempter. But as Düsterdieck remarks, far rather should we say that this passage throws back a light on that passage, and makes it likely that the case of Cain, and not that of Adam, is <i>there </i>referred to); <b>and ye know that every manslayer hath not</b> (is without the possession of) <b>eternal life abiding in him</b> (<b>ye know</b>, viz. by your own knowledge of what is patent and axiomatic in itself. We must not fall into the error of referring the saying to the <i>future lot</i> of the murderer: it regards his present state, and is another way of saying that he <i>“abideth in death,” </i>ver. 14.

The love of God to us is not that which would, <i>as such</i>, be adduced as a pattern to us of brotherly love; it is true that in the depth of the matter, all true love is love after that pattern: but in a passage so logically bound together it is much more probable that the term common to the two, Christ and ourselves, would be, not divine love, which as such is peculiar to Him, but love itself simply, that of which He has given the great example which we are to follow), <b>that He</b> (Christ, as the words beyond question shew) <b>laid down His life for us</b> (i.e. <i>died</i>: not as Grotius, who in all the places where it occurs maintains that it is only to <i>expose life to danger</i>, which would entirely enervate the Apostle’s saying here. The term <b>for us</b> carries in it and behind it all that we know of the nature of the death which is spoken of: but the vicariousness and atoning power of Christ’s death are not here in consideration : it is looked on here as the greatest possible proof of love, us in John xv, 13): <b>and we</b> (emphatic: we on our part as followers of Christ) <b>ought on behalf of the brethren to lay down our lives</b> (on <b>lives</b>, Socinus says well: “ He says not, that we ought to lay down our ‘<i>life</i>,’ as if one were bound to die for many, but, our <i>lives</i>, because each ought to die for each.” The Apostle states the duty generally; and thus stated it is clear enough. As Christ did in pursuance of His love, so ought we to do in pursuance of ours, bound as we are to Him not by the mere force of an outward example, but by the power of an inward life. But naturally and necessarily the precept finds its aerate tion only in those cases where our Heavenly Father's will sets the offering of such a sacrifice in the course and pursuance of our brotherly love, which He has ordained).<h2><u><b>17</b>.]</u></h2> <b>But </b>(“by the adversative connexion of ver. 17 with ver. 16 the Apostle marks the passage from the greater, which is justly demanded of us, to the lesser, the violation of which is all the more a transgression of the law just prescribed” Düsterdieck) <b>whosoever hath the world’s sustenance, and beholdeth</b> (the Greek word gives more than “<i>seeth</i>,” which would imply only the casual sight: it is the standing and looking on as a spectator: so that it ever involves not the eye only, but the mind also, in the sight: it is to <i>contemplate</i>, not simply to <i>see</i>.

The context indeed here might seem, as the mention of Christ’s love to us as so immediately preceded, to require the other meaning; or at least, that of “the love whereof God hath set us a pattern:” and accordingly both these have been held. But I see not how we can escape the force of the passages above cited) <b>abide in him</b> (Lücke and Düsterdieck are disposed to lay a stress on the word <b>abide </b>here, thereby opening a door for the view that the love of God may indeed be in him in some sense, but not as a firm abiding principle; that at all events at the moment when he thus shuts up his bowels of compassion, it is not <i>abiding </i>in him. But this world seem to violate the ideal strictness of the Apostle’s teaching, and the true sense rather to be, “How can we think of such an one as at all possessing the love of God in any proper sense?” giving thus much emphasis to the word <b>abide</b>. <br><br>Here again, as above in the case of the duty of laying down life for a brother, many questions of casuistry have been raised as to the nature and extent of the duty of almsgiving, on which it is impossible to enter here. The safest answers to them all will be found in the Christian conscience enlightened by the Holy Spirit, guiding the Christian heart warmed by the living presence of Christ) ?<h2><u><b>18.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Exhortation to true brotherly love: </i> following naturally on the example of the want of it given in the last verse. <b>Little children, let us not love with word, nor yet with tongue, but</b> (let us love) <b>in deed and truth</b> (there is some little difficulty in assigning these words their several places in the contrast. Notice first, that the two former, <b>with word</b> and <b>with tongue</b>, simply relate to the <i>instrument</i>, whereas the two latter are introduced by the preposition <i>in</i>, denoting the element in which. The trae account of the arrangement seems to be, that the usual contrast of <i>word </i>and <i>deed </i>is more sharply defined by the explanatory terms, <i>tongue </i>and <i>truth</i>: <b>with the tongue</b> giving, by making the mere bodily member the instrument, more precisely the idea of absence of truth than even <b>with word</b>, and <b>in truth</b> more definitely the idea of its presence than even <b>in deed</b>. As connected with the exhortation in this verse, I may cite the tradition reported by Jerome in his Commentary on Gal. vi. 10: “The blessed. John, the Evangelist, living on at Ephesus into extreme old age, and being with difficulty borne by the hands of his disciples to church, when he could not sustain his utterance for more words, used to say no more at each meeting than this: ‘Little children, love one another.’ At last his disciples and the brethren who were present, being wearied at hearing always the same words, said, ‘Master, why dost thou always go on saying this?’ The answer was worthy of St. John: ‘Because it is the Lord’s command; and if this ouly be done, it is enough’”).<h2><u><b>19—24.</b>]</u></h2> See the summary at ver. 11. <i>The blessed effects of trae brotherly love as a test of the Christian state. </i><h2><u><b>19, 20.</b>]</u></h2> [<b>And</b>] <b>in this </b>(see above, v. 1v0, 16.

But why stop at that which after all is <i>itself of</i> the truth? why not mount up to the Truth itself, that pure and objective Truth which is the common substratum and essential quality of the Spirit Himself, of the Word, of those who are born of the Word by the Spirit ?), <b>and shall persuade our hearts before him</b> (i.e. and in and by this same sign, shall still the questionings of our hearts before God, by the assurance that we are His true children. St. John uses <b>the heart</b> for the innermost seat of our feelings and passions: of alarm [John xiv. 1, 27], of mourning [xvi. 6], of joy [xvi. 22]. It was into the <i>heart </i>of Judas that the devil put the intent of betraying the Lord [xiii. 2]: and the <i>heart </i>here is the inward judge of the man,—whose office is, so to say, promoted by the conscience, accusing or else excusing [Rom. ii, 15]. Then, as to <b>shall persuade</b>, there is no need to give to the verb any unusual meaning. It does not mean “quiet” or “assure,” except in so far as its ordinary import, “persuade,” takes this tinge from the context.<br><br>It must be plain from what has been said, that the future, <b>shall persuade</b>, is not, on account of the words “<b>before</b> <b>Him,</b>” to be taken as referring to the future day of judgment, as some have done. In ch. iv, 17, which is in some respects parallel with this, that day is expressly named: whereas in our passage, an equally clear indication is given, by the parallelism of the two future verbs, <i>“shall know”</i> and <i>“shall persuade,”</i> that no such reference is intended. <b>before Him</b> is not, at His appearing, but, <i>in His sight</i>, as placed before His all-seeing eye.<h2><u><b>20.</b>]</u></h2> <i>takes up this matter of the persuading our hearts before God,</i> and <i>shews its true importance</i> and rationale. This is carried on in the following verses, but is here and in ver, 21 placed as its ground. If our heart, <i>before Him,</i> judges us unfavourably—we favourably still: if our heart condemn us not, again <i>before Him</i>, judging and seeing in the light of His countenance, then we know that we are at one with Him, and those consequences follow, which are set forth in ver. 22. The many difficulties which occur in <i>rendering </i>this verse cannot be presented to the mere English reader. They will be found discussed in my Greek Test. The context appears to stand thus. The Apostle in ver. 19 has said that by the presence of genuine love we shall know that we are of the truth, and shall persuade our hearts in God’s presence. He then proceeds to enlarge on this <i>persuading </i>our hearts <i>in general</i>. If our heart condemn us, what does it import? If our heart acquit us, what? The <i>condemnation</i>, and <i>acquittal</i>, are plainly and necessarily <i>opposed</i>, both in hypothesis and in result. If the consolatory view of ver. 20 is taken,—as softening our self-condemnation by the comforting thought of God’s greatness and infinite mercy,—then the general result of vv. 20, 21 will be, whether our heart condemn us or not, we have comfort and assurance: and then what would be the import of our <i>persuading </i>our hearts at all? But on the other interpretation, the condemnatory sense of ver. 20—as intensifying our self-condemnation by the thought that the cause of it is God, knowing more of our sin than we do—then, taken with some modifications, all will be clear, I say, taken with some modifications : because the sense has been much obscured by the mistake of introducing the particular case treated in ver. 18 into the general statements of vv. 20, 21.

And then, having given the reason why the <i>condemnation </i>should be set at rest by the <i>persuasion</i>, he goes on to give the blessed results of the <i>persuasion </i>itself in vv. 21, 22). <h2><u><b>21.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Beloved </b>(there is no adversative particle, because this address throws up the contrast quite strongly enough, as introducing the very matter on which the context lays the emphasis, viz., the <i>persuading our hearts</i>), <b>if our heart condemn us not, we have confidence towards God</b> (said generally; not with direct reference to that which follows ver. 22, which indeed is one form of this confidence: see ch. v.14, where the connexion is similar. The confidence here spoken of is of course present, not future in the day of judgment. <b>towards God</b>, i.e., with reference to God: but more than that: to God-ward, in our aspect as turned towards and looking to God. <br><br>It must be remembered that the words are said in the full light of the reality of the Christian state,—where the heart is awakened and enlightened, and the testimony of the Spirit is active: where the heart’s own deceit docs not come into consideration as a disturb- ing clement), <h2><u><b>22.</b>]</u></h2> <b>and </b>(such another <i>“and”</i> as that in verse 10 above, where, after the general statement, <i>“and”</i> introduced the particular instance in which the general truth was carried forward.

The Apostle is setting forth actual matter of fact) <b>from Him </b>(these words must be taken in all their simplicity, without capricious and arbitrary limitations. Like all the sayings of St. John, they proceed on the ideal truth of the Christian state. “The child of God,” as Huther says, “asks for nothing which is against the will of its Father”), <b>because </b>(ground of the above <i>receiving</i>)<b> we keep His commandments, and do the things which are pleasing in His sight</b> (on the last expression [and parallelism] see Exod. xv. 26; also Deut. vi. 18, xii. 25, Ezra x. 11, Isa. xxxviii. 3.

This however brings us to the theological difficulty of our verse, wherein it would seem at first sight as if the granting of our prayers by God depended, as its meritorious efficient, on our keeping of His commandments and doing that which pleases Him. And so some of the Roman- Catholic expositors here.

The doing of such works is the working of the life of Christ in us: they are its sign, they its fruits: they are not of us, but of it and of Him. They are the measure of our Chistian life: according to their abundance, so is our access to God, so is our reward from God: for they are the steps of our likeness to God, Whatever is attributed to them as an efficient cause, is attributed not to us, but to Him whose fruits they are, <i>Because </i>Christ is thus manifested in us, God hears our prayers, which He only hears for Christ’s sake: <i>because </i>His Spirit works thus abundantly in us, He listens to our prayer, which in that measure has become the voice of His Spirit. So that no degree of efficacy attributed to the good works of the child of God need surprise us: it is God recognizing, God vindicating, God multiplying, God glorifying, His own work in us. So that when, e-g., Cornelius- a-lapide says, “It is congruous, and the congruous reward of obedience and reconciliation (friendship), that if man does the will of God, God in His turn should do the will of man,” all we can reply is that such a duality, such a reciprocity, docs not exist for Christians: we are <i>in God</i>, He in us: and this St. John continually insists on. We have no claim <i>from without</i>: He works in us to do of His good pleasure: and the works which He works, which we work, manifest before Him, and before all, that we are His children. The assertion, <i>“whatsoever we ask, we receive,” </i>I reserve to be treated of on ch. v. 14, 15, where it is set forth more in detail).<h2><u><b>23.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Summing up of all these commandments in one: faith in Christ, and brotherly love according to Christ’s command.</i> <b>And </b>(see <i>“and”</i> similarly used, ch. i. 5, ii, 17, iii, 3) <b>His commandment</b> (“he mentions,” says Bede, “ but <i>one </i>commandment, and then subjoins <i>two</i>, faith and love, as being inseparable the one from the other.

This keeping of His (God’s) commandments is the abiding in God: this of which brotherly love is the first and most illustrious example and summary. So that the exhortation given at the beginning of this portion of the Epistle is still in the Apostle’s mind, as again ch. iv. 15, 16, and v. 20; see also ch. ii. 6, iii, 6, 9. <b>And he that keepeth His </b>(God’s) <b>commandments, abideth in Him </b>(God)<b>,</b> <b>and He</b> (God) <b>in him </b>(some hold that <b>He </b>and <b>Him </b>are to be referred to Christ. And no doubt they would be perfectly true, and according to our Lord’s own words, when thus applied : see John xiv. 15, xv. 5 ff. Still, from the context [see below], it is better to refer them to the chief subject, viz. to God. In the sense, the difference is not important. It is one of the most difficult questions in the explanation of this most difficult of Epistles, to assign such expressions as the present definitely to their precise personal object). <h2><u><b>24 b.</b>]</u></h2> And of one part of this mutual indwelling there is <i>a sign and token</i>, given us by God Himself, viz. <i>the Holy Spirit</i>.

It is intimately connected with what has immediately preceded. By brotherly love we are to know that we are of the truth, iii. 19,—and the token that He abideth in us is to be the Spirit which He gave us. This Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, it becomes then all-important for us to be able to distinguish, and not to be led astray by any false spirits pretending to his character and office. Such false spirits there are, which are not of God, but of the world, which make up that spirit of antichrist, of which prophecy had already spoken.<h2><u><b>1.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Beloved </b>(so ver. 7, and ch. iii. 2, 21, marking a transition to a subject on which the Apostle affectionately bespeaks their earnest attention), <b>believe not every spirit </b>(this expression, as also, <i>“the spirits,”</i> indicating plurality of spirits, we to be explained by the fact that both the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error speak by the spirits of men who are their organs. So we have, in reference to prophecy, 1 Cor. xiv. 32, <i>“The spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.”</i> By the nature of the testimony of the human spirits, we shall know whether they are of God or not; whether they are organs of the <i>spirit of truth</i>, or of the <i>spirit of error</i>. It will be observed that this interpretation. of <i>“every spirit,”</i> and the Apostle’s way of speaking, rest on the assumption of there being One Spirit of Truth, from God, and one spirit of error, from the world; as opposed to all rationalizing interpretations, and also to all figurative understanding of the word.

The Apostles and their companions in the ministry, or all believers? Or again, all teachers of God’s truth, the Apostles included? It is hardly likely that the wider meaning has place here, seeing that 1) he has before said <i>“ye are of God,” </i>and 2) he is here opposing one set of <i>teachers </i>to another. On the other hand, it is not likely that he should confine what is said to the Apostles only: such as are mentioned with praise in 3 John 5–8 would surely be included) <b>are of God</b> (see above): <b>he that knoweth</b> (apprehendeth: hath any faculty for the knowledge of. The Apostle sets <b>him that knoweth God</b> in the place of <i>him that is of God</i>, as belonging more immediately to the matter in hand, the hearing, and receiving more knowledge. This <i>knowing God</i>, the apprehension aud recognition of God, is the peculiar property of God’s children, not any natural faculty in which one unrenewed man differs from another) <b>God heareth us: he who is not of God doth not hear us</b> (here we must remember carefully, what the context is, and what its purpose. The Apostle is giving a test to distinguish, not the children of God from those who are not children of God, but the spirit of truth from the spirit of error, as is clear from the words following. And this he does by saying that in the case of the teachers of the truth, they are heard and received by those who apprehend God, but refused by those who are not of God. It is evident then that these two terms here, <i>“he that knoweth God,”</i> and <i>“he that is not of God,”</i> represent two patent, matters of fuet,—two classes open and patent to all: one of them identical with the <i>world </i>above: the other consisting of those of whom it is said above, <i>“Ye know the Father”</i>. . . <i>“ye know Him that is from the beginning,”</i> ch, ii. 13, 14. How these two classes are what they are, it is, not the purpose of this passage to set forth, nor need we here enquire: we have elsewhere tests to distinguish them, ch. iii. 9, 10, and have there gone into that other question. We have a striking parallel, in fact the key to these words, in the saying of our Lord to Pilate, John xviii. 37). <b>From this</b> (viz., not the whole foregoing train of circumstances; nor, those tests proposed in vv. 2, 3: but the facts set forth in vv, 5, 6: the reception of the false teachers by the world: the reception of the true teachers by those that apprehend God, and their rejection by those who are not of God. ‘The same point is touched hy our Lord in John x. 8, <i>“but the sheep did not hear them”</i>) <b>we know </b>(in this unemphatic first person the Apostle includes his readers: we, all God’s children. <b>know,</b> <i>distinguish, recognize,</i> as so often) <b>the Spirit of truth</b> (the Spirit that cometh of God and teacheth truth) <b>and the spirit of error</b> (the spirit that cometh of the devil, teaching lies and seducing men into error see ch. i, 8, ii, 26).<h2><u><b>7–21.</b>]</u></h2> The Apostle again takes up his<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18rS5dFCFJM3y1j3TDYxU6ZuLQAAX3n1A/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The great theme of the whole was enounced ch. ii. 29. The consideration of that has passed into the consideration of that righteousness in its highest and purest form of love, which has been recommended, and grounded on His love to us, in ch. iii. 11—18, where the testimony of our hearts came in, and was explained—the great test of His presence in us being the gift of His Spirit, iii. ult. Then from the necessity of distinguishing and being sure of that His Spirit, have been inserted the foregoing tests and cautions respecting truth and error. And now he returns to the main subject. The <i>knoweth God, is</i> and <i>hath been begotten of God,</i> the taking up again of God’s love to us in Christ at ver. 9 from ch. iii. 16, the reiteration of the testimony of the Spirit in ver. 13, all serve to shew that we are reading no collection of spiritual apophthegms, but a close and connected argument, though not in an ordinary style.<h2><u><b>7, 8.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Beloved</b> (as before, marks the fervency and affection of the Apostle turning to his readers with another solemn exhortation.

But take the proposition, <b>God is love</b>, of God’s essential being,—as a strict definition of God, and the argumentation will be strict: He that loveth not never knew love: God is love [the terms are co-essential and co-extensive]: therefore he who loveth uot never knew God).<h2><u><b>9, 10.</b>]</u></h2><i> Proof of this</i> as far as we are concerned, in God’s sending His Son to save us. <b>In this</b> (viz. which follows) <b>the love of God was manifested in regard to us</b> (these words, <b>in regard to us</b>, must be taken with the verb, not with the love of God. Many have thus wrongly connected it, and in consequence have been compelled to distort the <b>in regard to</b> into <i>“towards:”</i> so Luther, &c., and the A.V. Connected then with the verb, it must not be taken as equivalent to <i>“towards,”</i> but as “in,” i.e. “in the matter of,” in regard of: see ver. 16 below: the manifestation not being made <i>to us</i> as its spectators, but in our persons and cases, as its “material.” <b>us</b>, i.e. believers in general), <b>that God hath sent</b> (perfect tense. The manifestation is regarded as one act, done implicitly when God sent His Son: but the sending is regarded in its present abiding effects, which have changed all things since it took place) <b>His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Hcm</b> (no words can be plainer than these, and need less explanation to any one acquainted with St. John. The endeavours of the old rationalists, Socinus, Grotius, &e., to escape from the assertion of Christ’s pre-existence, by substituting <b>for into</b><i> the world, “to the world,”</i> for <b>only begotten,</b> <i>“dearly beloved,”</i> &c., may be seen in Düsterdieck. He well remarks, “Such expositors may naturally be expected to give an answer to the ‘question, how a Christ so understood could be our life [ver. 9], our atonement [ver. 10], or our salvation [ver. 14].” <br><br>The two emphatic words in the sentence are<b> only- begotten</b> and <b>live</b>. This was the proof, that SUCH a son of God was sent, that we might LIVE). <h2><u><b>10.</b>]</u></h2> <i>The same proof particularized</i> in its highest and noblest point, the atonement: and at the same time this brought ont, that the love manifested by it was all on God’s side, none on ours: was love to us when we were enemies, Rom. v. 8, and therefore all the greater. Ch. iii. 16 is very similar: except that there it is Christ’s personal love tous: here the Father’s, in sending His Son. <b>In this is love</b> (‘in this case,” “in this matter,” “herein,” <i>is</i>, ‘<i>is found</i>,’ <i>‘exists</i>,’ Love; in the abstract. ‘This interpretation is necessary, on account of the disjunction which follows. If the word love meant, the love of God just spoken of, then it would be irrelevant to subjoin that this love was not our love to Him but His to us), <b>not that we loved God</b> (the verb refers to an indefinite time past—no act of Jove of ours to God at any time done furnishes this example of love, but an act of His towards us, It is not the <i>nature </i>of our love to God, as contrasted with His to us, of which the clause treats, but the non- existence of the one love as set against the historical manifestation of the other. Again that “ He loved us, though we did not love Him,” is so far in the words as it is given by the context [see above], but is not the meaning of the words themselves), but <b>that He loved us</b> (referring again to an <i>act </i>of Love, which is now specified), and (prove this love in that He) <b>sent His Son</b> <b>a propitiation</b> (see on ch. ii. 2) <b>for</b> (see ibid.) <b>our sins</b> (His death being therein<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mzw7KTA87ppcK6MaZJxzCA8Udv-eoipN/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Strictly parallel with the latter part of ch. iii, 16, where the same ethical inference is drawn with regard to the example of Christ Himself. <b>Beloved</b> (the Apostle’s usual introduction of a fervent and solemn address, vv. 1, 7, al.), <b>if</b> (this <b>if</b> with an indicative, stating a fact, is very difficult to give exactly in English. It is not on the one hand any expression on uncertainty: but neither on the other is it exactly equivalent to <i>“since,”</i> or <i>“seeing that.”</i> We may call it a certainty put in the shape of a doubt, that the hearer’s mind may grasp the certainty for itself, not take it from the speaker. “If [it be true that]...” is perhaps the nearest English filling up of the sense)<b> God so loved us</b> (<i>so</i> namely as detailed in ver. 10, which, and which alone, is pointed at), <b>we also ought to love one another</b> (the <b>also</b> does not belong to the <b>ought</b>, but purely to the <b>we</b>,—“we, on our side.” But on whnt does the obligation, asserted in <b>we ought</b>, rest? Clearly, on that relation to God and one another implied by being children of God, which runs through all this section of the Epistle. If we are of God, that love which is in Him, and which He is, will be in us, will make us like Him, causing us to love those who are begotten of Him, ch, v. 1, 2. And of this love, our apprehension of His Love to us will be the motive and the measure). <h2><u><b>12.</b>]</u></h2> <b>God hath no one ever beheld</b> (what is the connexion of these words, so suddenly and startlingly introduced? It is evident that ver. 12 is connected with ver. 11, by the words <i>“if we love one another,”</i> taking up again <i>“we ought to love one another.”</i> But it is also evident that it is connected with ver. 13 by the words <i>“abideth in us,”</i> &c. And it is further plain, that these words, <b>God hath no one ever beheld</b>, must have some close reference to <i>loving one</i> <i>another</i>, seeing that they stand between those words in ver. 11, and the resumption of them in ver. 12.<br><br>Now on examining ver. 11, we find an unexpected substitution, <i>“if God so loved us, we also ought to love</i> (not <i>God</i>, but) <b>one another</b>.” Why so? Here, ver. 20 will guide us to an answer, if rightly used. Not, because we <i>cannot </i>love God whom we have not seen: but because the exponents of God, whom we have not seen, are our brethren, whom we do see. And the Apostle, in substituting <i>“one another,”</i> does not for a moment drop or set aside the higher, <i>“God,”</i> but in fact leads up to it, by putting its lower and visible objects before us. And then ver. 12 comes in as an explanation, an apology as it were, for this substitution, in the following manner: <i>Love</i> <b>one another</b>, I say: for the love to God, which is our duty, is love towards one whom we have never seen, and cannot exist in us [as ver. 20] unless by and with its lower degrees as manifested towards our brethren whom we have seen. By our love to them are we to know, how far we have love to Him: if that be present, He dwelleth in us, and <i>“the love of Him is perfected in us.”</i> And thus [see below] the way is prepared for vv. 15, 16, which take up and bring to a conclusion the reasoning): <b>if we love one another, God abideth in us</b> (for the reason already stated in ver. 8, and restated in immediate connexion with this very matter in ver. 16, that God is Love, and every one that loveth is born of God, knows God, abides in God and God in him), <b>and </b>(simply the copula) <b>the love of Him</b> (as in ch. ii. 5, where we had the same expression, our <i>love to Him</i>, not, as some explain it, <i>His love to us</i>. This is evident, not merely from ii. 5, but from the context here: sce it explained above, and remember that it is our love to God which is here the subject, as evinced by our love to our brethren. This is further shewn by the recurrence of the same expression in ver. 17, <i>“Herein is love perfected with us,”</i> and ver. 18, <i>“he that feareth is not made perfect in love.”</i> And so the majority of Commentators) is<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K09d9b0QzSHcYCI9AmBxjVqQt2QbR5jL/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Here, as there, it signifies, has reached its full maturity: the <i>loving one another</i> being the token and measure of it) <b>in us</b> (keep the primary and obvious sense, “<i>in us</i>,” “within us,” as in ch. ii. 5).<h2><u><b>13.</b>]</u></h2> <b>In this we know that we are abiding in Him and He in us, because He hath given us of His Spirit </b>(nearly repeated from ch. ii, 24. But why introduced here? In the former verse, the <i>fact </i>of His abiding in us was assured to us, if we love one another. Of this fact, when thus loving, we need a token. Him we cannot see: has He given us any testimony of His presence in us? He has given us such a testimony, in making us partakers of His Holy Spirit. This fact it is to which the Apostle here calls our attention, as proving not the external fact of the sending of the Son [ver. 14], but one within ourselves,— the indwelling of God in us, and our abiding in Him. It is obvious that all inferences from the expression <i>“given us of His Spirit”</i> against the personality of the Holy Ghost are quite beside the purpose: compare Acts ii. 17 with Joel iii. 1. We each dwelling of one and the same personal Spirit, but each according to our measure, 1 Cor. xii. 4, 11. One only had the Spirit without measure, in all His fulness: even Christ; John iii. 34. And the presence of the Holy Spirit is most aptly adduced here where love is in question, His first fruit being love, and His presence being tested by His fruits).<h2><u><b>14, 15, 16.</b>]</u></h2> The connexion seems to be this: the inward evidence of God's abiding in us and we in Him, is, the gift of His Spirit. But this is not the only evidence nor the only test which we have: This internal evidence is accompanied by, nay, is itself made possible [see ver. 19] by, our recognition of the Father’s love in sending His Son as our Saviour: which last is a fact, testified by human evidence. This recognition of God’s love is a condition of abiding in Him and He in us: in a word, is the <i>abiding in love</i>, which is equivalent to abiding in Him. <b>And we</b> (this <b>we</b>, emphatic, brings up in sharp relief the apostolic body, whom Christ appointed His witnesses, John xv. 27, Acts i. 8 The assertion is of the same kind as that in ch. i. 1) <b>have beheld </b>(with our eyes: the same word, and in the same sense, as in John i. 32) <b>and do testify that the Father hath sent </b>(do testify, not merely to the historical fact as a thing past, but to its abiding influence as implied by the words, <i>“Saviour of the world”</i> below: that the Father sent the Son, and that the Son is the Saviour of the world) <b>the Son</b> (better here than “<i>His</i> Son:” <b>the Father</b> and <b>the Son</b> are here used as theological terms) <b>as Saviour of the world </b>(<b>the world </b>here, as in ch. ii, 2, John iii, 16, in its widest sense: no evasion of this sense, such as the “<i>elect in all nations</i>,” is to be endured). <h2><u><b>15.</b>]</u></h2> And recognition of this fact is a condition and proof of the life of God. <b>Whosoever confesseth</b> (the same remark holds good of this confessing, as before with regard to denying, ch ii. 28: viz., that we must not bring into it more than the Apostle intends by it: it is not the “confession of the <i>life</i>” which is here spoken of, but that of the lips only. Of course it would be self-evident that, this is taken by the Apostle as ruling the life; but simply <i>as</i> a matter of course, Me speaks of the ideal realized) <b>that Jesus is the Son of God</b> (i.e. receives the testimony in the last verse as true), <b>God abideth in him, and he in God.</b> <h2><u><b>16.</b>]</u></h2> a) <b>And we</b> (not now the apostolic body only, but communicative; the Apostle and his readers.

See John vi. 69) <b>the love which God hath in regard to us</b> (literally <b>in us</b>, <i>in our case</i>, as above, ver. 9: not “towards us,” as Beza [and A. V.}, Luther, &c.), b) <b>God is Love, and he that abideth in love abideth in God and God </b>[<b>abideth</b>] <b>in him </b>(this is the solemn and formal restatement of that which has been the ground-tone of the whole since ver. 7. And here, as there, <i>Tove</i> is in its widest abstract sense. Its two principal manifestations are, love to God, and love to one another: but this saying is of Love absolute).<h2><u><b>17, 18.</b>]</u></h2> These verses, which are parallel with ch. iii. 19–21, set forth the confidence with which perfect love shall endow the believer in the great day of judgment. <b>Herein love perfected with us</b> (for the meaning of <b>herein</b>, see below. <b>Love</b>, not, as Luther and others, <i>God's love to us</i>: this is forbidden by the whole context: our verse is introduced by <i>“he that abideth in love,”</i> and continued by <i>“there is no fear in love:”</i> it is love dwelling and advancing to perfection in us. And again, not love to God merely, nor love to our brethren merely; these are concrete manifestations of it: but love itself in the abstract—the principle of love, as throughout this passage. This sense of <i>love</i> will point out that of <b>with us</b>, which belongs not to the word <i>love</i>, but to the verb, as in ver. 12. Love is considered as planted in us; its degrees of increase take place <b>with us</b>—not merely “<i>chez nous</i>,” <i>in us</i>, but as <i>concerned with us</i>; in a sense somewhat similar to that in “<i>magnified His mercy</i><b> with her</b>,” Luke i, 58. See 2 John 2, where however the idea of <i>dwelling with</i> is more brought out than here), <b>that we have confidence in the day of judgment</b> (that gives not the purpose of the <i>perfecting of love</i>, but the explanation of “<i>herein</i>:” “in this love is perfected in us, viz, that we, &c.” The confidence which we shall have in that day, and which we have even now by anticipation of that day, is the perfection of our love; grounded on the consideration [<i>because even as He is, &c.</i>] which follows: casting out fear, which cannot consist with perfect love, ver. 18): <b>because even as He</b> (Christ, see below) <b>is, we also are in this world</b> (this is the reason or ground of our confidence : that we, as we now are in the world, are like Christ: and in the background lies the thought, He will not, in that day, condemn those who are like Himself. In these words, the sense must be gained by keeping strictly to the tenses and grammatical construction: not “<i>as He</i><b> was</b> in the world,” as some, changing the tense. And when we have adhered to tense and grammar, wherein is the likeness spoken of to be found? Clearly, by what has been above said, not in our trials and persecutions. Nor by our being not of the world as He is not of the world: nor in that we, as sons of adoption through Him, are beloved of God, even as He is beloved: nor, in that we live in Love, as He lives in Love: but in that we are <i>righteous as He</i> <i>is righteous</i>, ch. ii. 29, iii. 3 ff., 10, 22: this being evinced by our abiding in Love. St. John does not’ say that Love is perfected in confidence in us, because we resemble Christ in Love; but he refers to the fundamental truth on which our Love itself rests, and says; because we are absolutely like Christ, because we are in Christ Himself, because He lives in us, for withont this there cannot be likeness to Him; in a word, because we are, in that communion with Christ which we are assured of by our<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nNVeTZY014eObvQY3Pjt2N0_RcklkDh0/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Essentially, the reason here rendered for our confidence in the day of judgment is the same as that given ch. iii. 21 f. for another kind of confidence, viz., that we keep His commandments. This also betokens the righteousness of which Christ is the essential exemplar, and which is a necessary attribute of those who through Christ are children of God),<h2><u><b>18.</b>]</u></h2> Confidence in (or as understood, as to) that terrible day presupposes the absence of fear: and this casting out of fear is the very work of love, which in its perfect state cannot coexist with fear.— <b>Fear</b> (abstract and general) <b>existeth not in love</b> (abstract and general also, as in ver. 17: not <i>“God’s lore to us;”</i> nor <i>“brotherly love”</i>), <b>nay perfect</b> (see on ver. 17) <b>love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment</b> (see below): <b>but he that feareth hath not been perfected in </b>[<b>his</b>]<b> love.</b> The points here to be noticed are, <br><br>1) the emphatic <b>existeth not</b>, which is better rendered as above, than “there is no fear in love,” in order to keep <b>fear</b>, which is the subject in the Greek, also the subject in. the English: <br><br>2) <b>nay</b>, or <i>“but:”</i> which is not here the mere adversative after a negative clause, in which case it would refer to something in which fear <i>is</i>, e.g. “<i>fear existeth not in love, but existeth in hatred:</i>” but it is the stronger adversative, implying “nay far otherwise:” so far from it, that... <br><br>3) the argument, which is, <i>a</i>) that nothing having torment can consist with perfect love: <i>b</i>) that, fear is in us by nature, and needs <i>casting out</i> in order to its absence. <br><br>4) the meaning of hath torment. Does <i>torment</i> mean <i>merely </i>pain, or pain as the result of <i>punishment</i>? This last is certainly the sense, both from the usage of the word, and from the context, in which the day of judgment is before us. Fear, by anticipating punishment, has it even now; bears about a foretaste of it and so partakes of it.<br><br>5) the last clause, “<i>he that feareth is not made perfect in love,</i>” is intimately connected with what follows [see on ver. 14] as well as with what went before. The <b>and</b> [in the original, <b>but</b>: see rendering above] is adversative to the whole preceding sentence, and mainly to the idea of perfect love therein expressed. <br><br>As regards the absence of fear from the love of the Christian believer, it has been well observed by Œumenius, that there are two kinds of godly fear, one which afflicts men with a sense of their evil deeds and dread of God’s anger, and which is not abiding: and the other, of which it is said, “The fear of the Lord is clean, and endureth for ever,” Ps. xix. and which is free from this kind of terror. And Bengel says in his brief pointed manner, “The condition of men is various: without fear and love alike: with fear and without love: with fear and love: without fear and with love.”<h2><u><b>19.</b>]</u></h2> I am sorry to be obliged here to differ from the best modern Commentators, and some of the older ones, in holding firmly that <b>we love</b>, indicative, is right, and not “<i>let us love,</i>” imperative [either of which would satisfy the original word]. This I do not merely on account of the expressed and emphatic <b>we</b>, though that would be a strong point in the absence of a stronger, but on account of the context, which appears to me to be broken by the imperative. He that feareth is not perfect in love. Our love [abstract, not specified whether to God or our brother] is brought about by, conditioned by, depends upon, His love to us first; it is only a sense off that which can bring about our love: and if so, then from the very nature of things it is void of terror, and full of confidence, as springing out of a sense of His love to us. Nor only so: our being new begotten in love is not only the effect of <i>a sense of</i> His past love, but is the effect of that love itself: <b>We</b> (emphatic—one side of the antithesis) <b>love</b> (most Commentators supply “<i>Him</i>” or “<i>one another</i>,” but unnecessarily. It is of all love that he is speaking; of love in its root and ideal), <b>because He </b>(God: see the parallel, ver. 10) <b>first loved us</b> (viz. in the sending of His Son).<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MEVBuAoqgmu1EanHHgwqn_CkVdWP75iF/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This <i>love</i> is sal, necessarily manifested in <i>both</i> of great departments of its exercise. Love, living and working in the heart as a principle, will fix first upon objects at hand and seen: those objects being natural objects for it to fix on, How then can a man love God, the highest object of love, who is removed from his sight, and at the ame time refuse to love his brother, bearing the mark of a child of God, before his eyes from day to day? Put in a brief form, the argument, as connected with the last verse, is this: His love has begotten <i>us </i>anew in love: in this <i>us</i> are included our brethren, objects of our daily sight: if therefore we do not love them, we do not love Him. <b>If any say</b> (“have said;” i.e. at any time: the saying once, rather than the habit, is the hypothesis), <b>I love God, and hate</b> (present tense, of habit) <b>his brother,</b> <b>he is a liar: for</b> (here again the argument needs supplying from our common sense, which tells us that sight is an incentive towards love) <b>he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen</b> (perfect tense, implying,—and continues to feel the influence of that sight. We do not say “<b>I</b> have seen him” of the dead, but of the living only), <b>cannot love God whom he hath not seen</b> (At. John does not say that there is no love without sight; nor that we love all we see better than any thing we do not see: his argument rests on a deeper and truer position: viz, on that assumed in the term <b>his brother</b>, which carries with it the consideration that he of whom it is said is begotten of God. Both terms, <b>his brother</b>, and <b>God</b>, are used within the limits of the Christian life, of which that is true, which is unfolded ch. v. 1, that this <i>brother</i>, as begotten of God, is a necessary object of love to one that loves Him that begat him. <i>Here</i>, a lower step of the same argument is taken ; but without this eat truth, lying beneath the word <i>brother</i>, it wonld carry no conviction with it).<h2><u><b>21.</b>]</u></h2> And besides this argument from common sense, there is another most powerful one, which the Apostle here adds: “How lovest thou Him, whose commandment thou hatest?” as Augustine says. <b>And this commandment we have from Him</b> (God: not, Christ: see below), <b>that he who loveth God, love also his brother</b> (where have we this commandment? In the great summary of the law, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, ... and thy neighbour as thyself so often cited by our Lord: see Matt. xxii. 37—39),<h1><u><b>CHAP. V. 1.</b>]</u></h1> And who is our brother? and why does this name carry with it such an obligation to love? These questions, in closest connexion with the last verse, the Apostle answers in this, <b>Every one that believeth that Jesus is the Christ hath been begotten of God</b> (to whom do these words apply? from what follows, in the verb <b>hath been</b> [or, <b>is</b>] <b>begotten</b> is taken up by <b>him that is begotten</b>, to the brother whom we are to love as a necessary accompaniment of our loving God. But most Commentators assume that it is of <i>ourselves</i> that this is said: <i>our </i>birth of God depends on and is in closest union with our faith, ch. iii. 23. Then the connexion between this and the following clause must be made by filling up an ellipsis, “and if begotten of God we love God.” But this is far-fetched ; and, as has been above shewn implicitly, alien from the context, the object of which is to point out who those are whom we are bound to love, if we love God.

Almost all the Commentators refer to Matt. xi. 86, “<i>My yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</i>” This declaration, that His commandments are not grievous, has, as did ch. iii. 9, furnished some of the Roman-Catholic Commentators with an opportunity of characterizing very severely the Protestant position, that none can keep God’s commandments. But here, as there, the reply is obvious and easy. The course of the Apostle’s argument here, as introduced in the next verse by <b>because</b>, substantiates this fact, that His commandments are not grievous, by shewing that all who are born of God are standing in and upon the victory which their faith has obtained over the world. In this victorious state, and in as far as they have advanced into it, in other words in proportion as the divine life is developed and dominant in them, do they find those commandments not grievous. If this state, in its ideality, were realized in them, there would be no difficulty for them in God’s commandments: it is because, and in so far as, sin is still reigning in their mortal bodies, and their wills are unsubdued to God’s will, that any grievousness, any burden, remains in keeping those commandments),<h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> <b>because</b> (reason, why His command- ments are not grievons) <b>all that is begotten of God </b>(the neuter is here used as gathering together in one, under the category of “begotten of God,” the “<i>we</i>” implied in the last verses) <b>conquereth</b> (of habit: simply predicated of the category, <i>“all that is born of God”</i>) <b>the world</b> (the kingdom of evil under its prince the devil, God’s adversary.

And this conclusion is put in the form of a triumphant question: What other person can do it? Who that believes this, can fail to do it? <b>Who is he that conquereth the world, except he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</b> By comparing ver. 1 a, we find 1) that <i>“the Christ”</i> there answers to <i>“the Son of God”</i> here; 2) that by the combination, of the two verses, we get the proposition of ver. 4a.<h2><u><b>6–21.</b>]</u></h2> THE THIRD AND LAST DIVISION OF THE EPISTLE.

Complete accounts of both the exposit and the criticism will be found in the recent monographs on the Epistle: more especially in that of Düsterdieck.<h2><u><b>6.</b>]</u></h2> <b>This</b> (viz. the Person spoken of in the last verse; Jesus. This, which is maintained by most Commentators, is denied by Knapp and Huther, who refer this to <i>“the Son of God:”</i> “The Son of God is he, &c.:” making the proposition assert, the identity of the Son of God with the historical Jesus, not the converse. ‘This Huther supports on two grounds: 1) that the fact that Jesus came by water and blood needed no proof even to Heretics: 2) that on the ordinary interpretation the following words, <i>“Jesus Christ,”</i> become altogether superfluous. But to these it is easily replied, 1) that although the fact might be confessed, that was not confessed to which the fact bore testimony, viz. that Jesus who came in the flesh was the Son of God: 2) that the appositional clause, <i>“Jesus Christ,”</i> is by no means superfluous, being only a solemn reassertion of our Lord’s Person and Office as testified by these signs. The main objection to Huther’s view is, that, as well stated by Düsterdieck, it makes the coming by water and blood, which, by the context, is evidently in the Apostle’s argument, a substantiating consideration, to be merely an exceptional one: “this Son of God is Jesus the Christ, <i>though</i> He came by water and blood.” Therefore the other interpretation must stand fast) <b>is he that came by water and blood </b>(<b>came</b> refers not to the Lord’s birth in the flesh, but to His open manifestation of himself before the world.

Two canons of interpretation have been laid down by Düsterdieck, and may safely be adopted: 1) “Water” and “blood” must point both to some purely historical facts in the life of our Lord on earth, and to some still present witnesses for Christ: and 2) they must not he interpreted symbolically, but understood of something so real and powerful, as that by them God’s testimony is given to believers, and eternal life assured to them. These canons at once exclude all figurative interpretations, such as that of Socinus und his school, in which <i>water </i>stands for the purity and innocence of the life and doctrine of Christ, Heb. x. 22, Eph. v. 26, —and <i>blood</i> for the death of Christ as His testimony of Himself.<br><br>Düsterdieck observes that it is remarkable that the best Roman-Catholic expositor, Estius [whose commentary is unfortunately broken off at this verse], does not, as some have done, interpret <b>blood </b>of the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, but puts together <i>water</i> and <i>blood</i>, as Calvin and Luther. So that, as Düsterdieck proceeds to say, the great leaders of the three schools of theology have had the tact to see that which their less skilled followers have missed seeing,—that <i>blood</i> cannot by any means be understood of the Lord’s Supper, as has been done by many.<br><br>The next point which comes before us is to enquire whether at. all, or how far, our passage is connected with John xix.34? It occurs here, because many Commentators have seen in the incident there related a miraculous symbolizing of the two sacraments, and in this passage an allusion to that incident. To deny all such allusion seems against probability. The Apostle could hardly both here and in that place lay such evident stress on the water and blood together, without having in his mind some link connecting this place and that. The idea that we have here nothing more than a reference to the fact of John xix. 34, is against our 2nd canon above: but that John xix. 34 and this refer to the same fundamental truth, is I conceive hardly to be doubted.<br><br>It rests now then that we enquire into the meaning of each expression. On the first, <b>blood</b>, there cannot surely be much uncertainty. The blood of His Cross must, by all Scripture analogy, be that intended. The pouring out of this blood was the completion of the baptism which He had to be baptized with, Mark x. 28, 29, Luke xii. 50. And if this is so, to what can the term <b>water</b> be referred so simply, as to that baptism with water, which inaugurated the Lord’s ministry? It might indeed be said, that the baptism which He instituted for His followers, better satisfies the test of our 2nd canon, that viz. of being an abiding testimony in the Christian Church. But to this there lies the objection, that as <i>blood</i> signifies something which happened to Christ Himself, so must <i>water</i> likewise, at least primarily, whatever permanent testimony such event may have left in the Christian Church. And thus some modern Commentators have taken it; as uniting the historical fact of the Lord’s baptism with the ordinance of baptism, grounded on it, and abiding in the Christian Church. Düsterdieck refuses to accept this view, denying that our Lord’s baptism was any proof or testimony of His Messiahship, aud understanding water of the ordinance of baptism only. But surely we are not right in interpreting the words “<i>He that came by water,</i>” <i>He that ordained baptism:</i> nor in giving the two,<i> blood </i>and <i>water</i>, an entirely different reference. For his endeavour to escape from this by making the former represent not Christ’s death but His blood, applied to us, cannot be accepted, as giving a “non-natural” sense to the words <i>“he that came by blood”</i> likewise.<br><br>All this being considered, it seems impossible to avoid giving both to <i>blood </i>and <i>water </i>the combined senses above indicated, and believing that such were before the Apostle’s mind. They represent,—the <b>water</b>, the baptism of water which the Lord Himself underwent and instituted for His followers,—the <b>blood</b>, the baptism of blood which He Himself underwent, and instituted for His followers. And it is equally impossible to sever from these words the historical accompaniments and associations which arise on their mention.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q2dObTAxzpq-9DCnQWw4GUX_Os62HDWP/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And thus both our canons are satisfied, which certainly is not the case in Düsterdieck’s interpretation, though they were laid down by himself), <b>Jesus Christ </b>(see above on <b>this</b>, In all the places where St. John uses this Name, it las a solemn meaning, and is by the emphasis thus thrown on the official designation of our Lord, nearly equivalent to “<i>Jesus the Christ.</i>” Compare John i. 17, xvii. 3: 1 John i. 3, 7, ii. 1, iii. 23, iv. 2, v. 20: 2 John 3, 7): <b>not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood</b> (<b>in</b>, see above on <b>by</b>. The sense of the two is there shewn to be closely allied, in giving rather the “element in which,” <b>by</b>, the medium through which. The definite article before each word shews that they are well-known and solemn ideas. It is inserted not as matter of course, but as giving solemnity.<br><br>But why has the Apostle added this sentence? It has been thought that it is to give Christ the preference over Moses, who came only by water (1 Cor. x. 2), and Aaron, who came only by blood (of sacrifice), whereas Christ united both. But this is too far-fetched. Another opinion again regards the words as directed against those who despised the Cross of Christ (1 Cor. i. 23): but a more definite explanation than this is required. And those can hardly be wrong, who find it in such words as those of the Baptist in John i. 25, <i>“I baptize with (in) water, but there standeth one among you whom ye know not:”</i> compare the emphatic repetitions below, ver. 31, <i>“I came baptizing with (in) water;”</i> and ver. 38, <i>“He that sent me to baptize with (in) water.”</i> The baptism of Jesus was not one of water only, but one of blood,—<i>“behold the Lamb of God”</i>—and something more than that which follows in the next clause): <b>and the Spirit is that which witnesseth, because the Spirit is the truth</b> (that is, as explained by the next verse, the Spirit is an additional witness, besides those already mentioned to the Messiahship of Jesus, and in that, to the eternal life which God has given us in Him. Some have thought that <b>because </b>should be “that:” the same Greek word signifying hoth these. But it is not to the fact that the Spirit is the truth, that the Spirit gives witness: but it is the fact that He is the truth, which makes Him so weighty a witness; which makes the giving of witness so especially His office.<br><br>Very various however have been the meanings here given to <b>the Spirit</b>. One view understands, the spirit of our Lord, which He when dying commended into His Father’s hands, Another, explaining <i>water and blood </i>of the two Sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, sees in <b>the Spirit</b>, in connexion with John xx. 22 ff., a third Sacrament of <i>absolution</i>, Others regard it as equivalent to <i>the spiritual man</i>, i.e. St. John himself. Others again regard it as equivalent to God—and the occasion of the testimony to be the Resurrection, when our Lord rose with Divine power. The Socinian Commentators interpret it of the divine power by which Christ wrought His miracles. But this, as well as Bede’s interpretation, that the Spirit which descended on the Lord at His baptism is meant, inasmuch as it testified to His being the true Son of God, fails, in giving no <i>present abiding</i> testimony such as the context requires. Others again understand by it the ministry of the word.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_EjdK5p_DmoueaLGAosIMiPwnARq1L2U/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But nothing ean be plainer than that we must not alter the meaning, where the word <b>for</b> binds together the sentences so closely.<br><br>The above interpretations failing to give any satisfactory account of the text, we recur to the simple and obvious meaning, <i>the Holy Spirit</i>. And it seems fully to satisfy all the requirements of the passage. The Holy Spirit is He, who testifies of Christ [John xv. 26], who glorifies Him, and shews of the things which belong to Him [John xvi. 14]. It is by the possession of Him that we know that we have Christ [ch. iii, 24], And the following clause, “because the Spirit is the Truth,” exactly agrees with this. He is the absolute truth [John xiv. 17, xv. 26], leading into all the truth [John xvi. 13 f.]. And in this consists the all-importance and the infallibility of His witness). <h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> “John here renders a reason why he spoke not of the Spirit only, who has the chief authority in this matter, but also of the water and the blood, because in them also there is no small credit due to testimony, and the ternary number is in case of witnesses the most complete.” Grotius. <b>For</b> (that this, and not “<i>because</i>,” is the correct English reading, see my Greek Test.) <b>those who bear witness are three</b> (the three are considered as living and speaking witnesses; hence we have the masculine form in the original. By being <i>three</i>, they fulfil the requirements of the Law as to full testimony: Deut. xvii. 6, xix. 15: Matt. xviii. 16, 2 Cor. xiii, 1), <b>the Spirit, and the water, and the blood</b> (now, the Spirit is put first: and not without reason. The Spirit is, of the three, the only living and active witness, properly speaking: besides, the water and the blood are no witnesses without Him, whereas He is independent of them, testifying both in the und out of them), <b>and the three concur in one</b> (contribute to one and the same result: viz. the truth that Jesus is the Christ, and that we have life in Him. And this their one testimony is given by the purification in the water of baptism into His name, John iii. 5: by the continual cleansing from all sin which we enjoy in and by His atoning blood: by the inward witness of His Spirit, which He hath given us).<br><br>The question of the genuineness of the words read in the received text at the end of ver. 7 is discussed, as far as external grounds are concerned, in the Digest in my Greek Test.; and it may there be seen, that unless pure caprice is to be followed in the criticism of the sacred text, <i>there is not the shadow of a reason for supposing them genuine</i>. Even the supposed citations of them in early Latin Fathers have now, on closer examination, disappeared.—Something remains to be said on internal grounds, on which we have full right to enter, now that the other is secured. And on these grounds it must appear, on any fair and unprejudiced consideration, that the words are 1) alien from the context: 2) in themselves incoherent, and betraying another hand than the Apostle’s. For 1) the context, as above explained, is employed in setting forth the reality of the substance of the faith which overcomes the world. even of our eternal life in Jesus the Son of God. And this is shewn by a threefold testimony, subsisting in the revelation of the Lord Himself, and subsisting in us His people. And this testimony is the water of baptism, the blood of atonement, the Spirit of truth, concurrent in their witness to the one fact that He is the Son of God, and that we have eternal life in Him. Now <i>between two steps</i> of this argument,—not as a mere analogy referred to at its conclusion,—insert the words “for there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one,” and who can fail to see, unless prejudice have blinded his eyes, that the context is disturbed by the introduction of an irrelevant matter? Consequently, Bengel, one of the most strennous upholders of the words, is obliged tamely to take refuge in the transposition of vv. 7 and 8 (which was perhaps the original form of its insertion in the vulgate), so as to bring into treatment the matter in hand, before the illustration of it is introduced. But even suppose this could be done; what kind of illustration is it? What is it to which our attention is directed?

Is this triplicity a fact worthy of such a comparison? And then, what is the testimony in heaven? Is it borne to men? Certainly not: for God hath no man seen, as He is there: His only-begotten Son hath declared Hiin to us on earth, where all testimony affecting us must be borne. Is it a testimony to angels? Possibly: but what has this to do with the matter in hand? And then, again, what but an unworthy play on words can it be called, to adduce the fact of <b>oneness</b> on the one side, the essential unity of the ever blessed Godhead, and on the other the concurrence in testifying to one fact,—as correspondent, to one another? Does not this betray itself as the fancy of a patristic gloss, in the days when such analogies and comparisons were the sport of every theological writer? And 2) the very’ words betray themselves. <i>“The Father”</i> and <i>“the Word”</i> are never combined by St. John, but always <i>the Father</i> and <i>the Son</i>. The very apology of Bengel, “the appellative, <i>the Word</i>, is most appropriate to <i>testimony</i>,” may serve to shew how utterly weak he must have felt the cause to be.<br><br>The best conclusion to the whole subject is found in the remark of Bengel himself on another occasion of the practice reprobated, of which he himself furnishes here so striking an instance: “They exhibit a mischievous zeal in the Lord’s quarrels, who bring themselves to reason thus, ‘This text is convenient for my doctrine and argument; therefore I will constrain myself to believe it genuine, and will obstinately defend it, and all that can be scraped together on its behalf.’ But the Truth needs not false supports, resting much better on itself alone.” As the results of critical enquiry now stand, we may safely affirm, that no reasonable man, acquainted with the facts, can again defend, the genuineness of these words. If any do defend them, it is the charitable conclusion that he speaks in ignorance. The real mischief is, that the ignorant in high places allow themselves to use the strong language of authority, and thus become the chief enemies of truth. A sketch of the principal particulars of the dispute and of the books relating to it is given in Horne’s Introduction, vol. iv. pp. 355–388.<h2><u><b>9.</b>]</u></h2> An argument <i>from the less to the greater</i>, grounded on the practice of mankind, by which it is shewn that God’s testimony must be by all means believed by us.<b> If we </b>(mankind in general; all reasonable men) <b>receive </b>(as we <i>do</i>: receive with approval; <i>accept</i>) <b>the testimony of men </b>(generic; <b>the </b>testimony, i.e. in any given ease. No special testimony need be thought of, as touching this present case: the proposition is general), <b>the testimony of God is greater </b>(supply in the argument, “and therefore much more ought we to receive that.” The testimony of God here spoken of is not any particular testimony, as the prophecies concerning Christ, or the testimony of the Baptist and other eye-witnesses to Him, or the Prophets, the Baptist, Martyrs, and Apostles: it is general, as is the testimony of men with which it is compared. The particular testimony pointed at by the general proposition is introduced in the following words): <b>for</b> (see above at the beginning of ver. 7. Here there is an ellipsis: “and this maxim applies in the case before us, because”) <b>the testimony of God is this, that He hath borne testimony concerning His Son</b> (i.e. the testimony of God to which the argument applies is this, the fact. that He hath borne testimony to His Son).<h2><u><b>10–12.</b>]</u></h2> The perfect tense, <i>“hath Borne witness,”</i> in ver. 9, shewed that the testimony spoken of is not merely an historical one, such for instance as Matt. iii.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qFDGpciWt7_FbdmirmWoubc0JbbRvSNy/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And these verses explain to us what that testimony is. <b>He that believeth in the Son of God hath the testimony </b>(just spoken of; the testimony <i>of God</i>) <b>in him</b> (i.e. in himself. The two readings do not differ in sense. The object of the divine testimony being, to produce faith in Christ, the Apostle takes him in whom it has wrought this its effect, one who habitually believes in the Son of God, and says of such an one that he possesses the testimony in himself. What it is, he does not plainly say till below, ver. 11. But easily enough here we can synthetically put together and conjecture of what testimony it is that he is speaking: the Spirit by whom we are born again to eternal Life, the water of baptism by which the new birth is brought to pass in us by the power of the Holy Ghost [John iii. 5, Titus iii. 5], the Blood of Jesus by which we have reconciliation with God, and purification from our sins [ch. i. 7, ii. 2], and eternal life [John vi. 53 ff.],—these three all contribute to and make up our faith in Christ, and so compose that testimony, which the Apostle designates in ver. 11 by the shorter term which comprehends them all): <b>he that believeth not God</b> (St. John, as so frequently, proceeds to put his proposition in the strongest light by bringing out the opposite to it. The <i>believing</i> simply is wholly different from “<i>believing on</i>” above. That is the resting trust of faith: this the mere first step of giving credit to a witness. And thus it is tacitly assumed that one who does not believe in the Son of God, gives no credit to God Himself) <b>hath made Him a liar</b> (perfect tense, because the state of discredit implies a definite rejection still continuing. On the expression, see ch. i, 10),<b> because he</b> <b>hath not believed in</b> (here, not only, hath not credited, though that was the more shameful rejection of God’s word : but now the <i>full </i>rejection—the refusal to <i>believe in</i>, cast himself on God’s testimony) <b>the testimony which God hath testified concerning His Son.</b><h2><u><b>11.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Wherein this testimony consists.</i> <b>And the testimony</b> (just spoken of) <b>is this, that</b> (consists in this, namely, that ....) <b>God gave</b> (not, as A. V., “<i>hath given.</i>” This is of especial importance here, where not the endurance of a state, but the fact of the gift having been once made, is brought out. The present assurance of our possessing this gift follows in the next clause, and in ver. 12) <b>to us</b> (not <i>decreed</i>, or <i>promised</i>, but gave, absolutely) <b>eternal life, and</b> (this clause does not depend on “<i>this is the witness, that...,”</i> but <i>ranges with</i> that clause: “<i>this is the</i> <i>witness, &c.; and this life is, &c.</i>”) <b>this life is in His Son</b> (is in Him essentially [John i. 4, xi. 25, xiv. 6], bodily [Col. ii. 9], energetically [2 Tim. i. 10]. Here again, as ever in this Epistle, we have to guard against the evasive and rationalistic interpretations of the Socinians, that “the reason of our getting eternal life from God is found in Jesus Himself” [so Socinus]: that in is put for <i>“by,”</i> and is for “<i>happens</i>” [so Grotius]).<h2><u><b>12.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Conclusion of the whole argument</i> from ver. 6: dependent on the lust clause of ver. 11, and carrying it on a step further, even to the absolute identity as matter of possession for the believer, of the Son of God, and eternal life. <b>He that hath the Son, hath the life: he that hath not the Son of God, the life hath he not.</b> First notice the diction and arrangement, on which Bengel has well remarked, “The verse has two members: in the former ‘<i>of</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AC_ZFYob11qXiWUyn_-FgSgDHyPQn0Qr/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This view is far more probable, than that it should refer only to what has occurred since ver. 6, as ch. ii. 26 to ver. 18 ff. there: or only to vv. 11, 12. Still less likely is it that the concluding portion of the Epistle <i>begins </i>with this verse, as some lve thought. <b>These things wrote I to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life,</b> [<b>to you</b>] <b>that believe in the name of the Son of God </b>(the two readings come, in the sense, to much the sane. If that in the A. V. be followed, then the words <i>“that ye may believe”</i> must be interpreted “that ye may continue to believe”).<h2><u><b>14–21.</b>]</u></h2> CLOSE OF THE EPISTLE. The link which binds this passage to ver. 13 is the word <b>confidence</b>, taken up again from the <i>knowledge</i> spoken of in that verse, This <i>confidence </i>is the very energizing of our spiritual life: and its most notable and ordinary exercise is in communion with God in prayer, for ourselves or for our brethren, vv. 14–17. Then vv. 18–20 continue the explanation of the “sin unto death” and the “sin not unto death,” by setting forth the state of believers as contrasted with that of the world, and the truth of our eternal life as consisting in this, Then with a pregnant caution, ver. 21, the Apostle closes his Epistle.<h2><u><b>14, 15.</b>]</u></h2> <i>The believer's confidence as shewn in prayer.</i><b> And the confidence which we have towards Him</b> (which follows as a matter of immediate inference from the fact of our spiritual life: see ch. iii. 19–21) <b>is this, that if we ask any thing according to His will, He heareth us</b> (this confidence may be shewn in varions ways, including prayer as one, ch. iii. 22. And that one, of prayer, is alone chosen to be insisted on here. <br><br><b>Him </b>and <b>His will</b> must by all analogy be referred to the Father, not to the Son, by whom we have access to the Father. See especially ch. ii, 21, 22. <br><br>The truth that God hears all our prayers, has been explained on ch. iii, 22. The condition here attached, that the request be <b>according to His will</b>, is in fact limitation within the reality of the Christian life, i.e. in St. John’s way of speaking according to the true ideal. For God’s will is that to which our glorious Head himself submitted himself, and which rules the whole course of the Christian life for our good and His glory: and he who in prayer or otherwise tends against God’s will is thereby, and in so far, transgressing the bounds of his life in God: see James iv. 3. By the continual feeling of submission to His will, joined with continual increase in knowledge of that will, our prayers will be both chastened, and directed aright. If we knew His will thorough! and submitted to it heartily, it would be impossible for us to ask any thing, for the spirit or for the body, which He should not hear and perform. And it is this ideal state, as always, which the Apostle has in<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpHvxTJbFEf5A4esUMRik75LTGJfkrNd/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In this view he goes still further in the next verse).<h2><u><b>15.</b>]</u></h2> <b>And if we know that He heareth us whatsoever we ask </b>(i.e. our every petition: the condition is omitted this time, as being supposed to be fulfilled), <b>we know that we have the petitions </b>(i.e. the things which form the subject of the petitions) <b>which we have asked from Him</b> (notice the present, <b>we have</b>, combined with the perfect, <b>we have asked.</b> The perfect reaches through all our past prayers to this moment. All these we <b>have</b>: not one of them is lost: He has heard, He has answered them all: we know that we have them in the truest sense, in possession).<h2><u><b>16, 17.</b>]</u></h2> Join together the confidence concerning prayer just expressed, and the all-essential Christian principle of brotherly love, and we have following as matter of course, the duty, and the practice, of intercession for an erring brother. And of this, with a certain not strictly defined limitation, these verses treat. <b>If any man see </b>(on any occasion: <i>“shall have seen”</i>) <b>his brother</b> (as throughout the Epistle, to be taken in the stricter sense: not any neighbour, but his Christian brother, one born of Ged as he is himself) <b>sinning</b> (this present participle is net merely predicative, but graphic, as describing the ‘brother’ actually in the act and under the bondage of the sin in question) <b>a sin not unto death</b> (see below), <b>he shall ask</b> (the future conveys not merely a permission to ask, “it shall be lawful for him to ask,”— but a command, taking for granted the thing enjoined as that which is to happen), <b>and shall give him life</b> (viz. the <i>asker</i> shall give: not, as many have understood it, <i>God </i>shall give him life, though of course this is so in reality: but the words mean, he, interceding for his brother, shall be the means of bestowing life on him. This bestowal of life by intercessory prayer, is not to be minutely enquired into, whether it is to be accompanied with fraternal rebuke,—whether it consists in the giving to the sinner a repentant heart, but taken as put by the Apostle, in all its simplicity and breadth. <i>Life</i>, viz. the restoration of that divine life from which by any act of sin he was indeed in peril and indeed in process of falling, but his sin was not an actual fall) <b>for them that sin not unto death</b> (the clause takes up and emphatically repeats the hypothesis before made, viz., that the sin of the brother is not unto death. It does so in the plural, because the <b>him </b>before being indefinite, all such cases are now collected in a class: “shall give this life, I repeat, to those who sin not unto death”). <b>There is a sin unto death: concerning it I do not say that he should make request</b> (leaving for the present the great question, I will touch the minor points in this verse. First, it necessarily by the conditions of the context involves what is equivalent to a prohibition. This has been denied by many Commentators. “Ask if thou wilt, but in uncertainty of obtaining,” says Cornelius-a-lapide. And it is equally denied, without the same implied meaning being given, by many others: some of these, as Neander, thinking it implied, that prayer may be made, though the obtaining of it will be difficult,—others, as De Wette, that it will be in vain, others, as Huther, that St.John simply says such a case was not within his view in making the above command. And most of even these who have recognized the prohibition, strive to soften it, saying, as e.g. Lyra, that though “we are not to pray for the condemned,” yet we may pray for such a sinner, “that he may sin less, and so be less condemned in hell:” or as Bengel, “God willeth not that the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15OGNWZWkNoEchndyT8rnhN4g0wiIvzBC/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

If therefore one who has committed mortal sin is brought back to life, it is from the mere divine purpose, reserved from us.” Calvin indeed holds fast the prohibition in all its strictness, but only in extreme cases: adding, “But, seeing that this happens most rarely, and God, commending the immense riches of His grace, commands us to be merciful after His example: we must pass upon any man the judgment of eternal death, but rather charity should induce us to hope well of him. But if the desperate impiety of some looks to us hardly short of a pointing it out by the finger of the Lord God, it is not for us to contend with the just judgment of God, or desire to be more merciful than He is.” <br><br>Certainly this seems, reserving the question as to the nature of the sin, the right view of the words, <b>I say not</b>. By an express command in the other case, and then as express an exclusion of this case from that command, nothing short of an implied prohibition can be conveyed.<br><br>The second point here relates to the difference between <b>ask </b>and <b>make request</b>. The <i>Greek </i>word represented by the former is more of the petition <i>of the inferior</i>, as of the conquered, or of the guilty: that re-represented by the latter is more general, of the request <i>of the equal</i>, or of one who has a right. Our Lord never uses the former of His own requests to God, but always the latter. And this difference is of importance here. The <b>asking </b>for a sin not unto death is a humble and trusting petition in the direction of God’s will, and prompted by brotherly love: the other, the <b>making request</b> for a sin unto death, would be, it is implied, an act savouring of presumption—a prescribing to God, in a matter which lies out of the bounds of our brotherly yearning [for notice, the hypothesis that a man sees <i>a brother</i> sin a sin unto death is not adduced in words, because such a sinner would not truly be a brother, but thereby demonstrated never to have deserved that name: see ch. ii. 19], how He shall inflict and withhold His righteous judgments.<br><br>And these latter considerations bring us close to the question as to the nature of the sin unto death. It would be impossible to enumerate or even classify the opinions which have been given on the subject. Düsterdieck has devoted many pages to such a classification and discussion. I ean do no more than point out the canons of interpretation, and some of the principal divergencies. But before doing so, ver. 17 must come under consideration).<h2><u><b>17.</b>]</u></h2> <b>All unrighteousness is sin</b> (in the words <b>all unrighteousness</b> we have a reminiscence of ch. i. 9, “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from <b>all unrighteousness</b>,” and also, but not so directly, of ch. iii, 4, which is virtually the converse proposition to this. Here the Apostle seems to say, in explanation of what he has just written, “SIN is a large word, comprehending all unrighteousness whatever: whether of God's children, or of aliens from Him.” The thoughts which have been brought into these words,—that <i>unrighteousness</i> is a mild word, meant to express that every slight trip of the good Christian fills under the category of sin, and so. there may be a sin not unto death, —or, on the other hand, that it is a strong word, as Grotius says, “he calls unrighteousness not every ignorance or sudden fall into sin, but sin committed either with deliberation, or with space given for deliberation,” —or thirdly, as Beza, that “all sins are so far equal, that even the least thought of the least sin deserves eternal death a thousand times over,” and “that all sins are of themselves deadly,”—are equally far from the meaning of the words, whose import is, as above, to account for there being a sin not unto death as well as a sin unto death); <b>and there is a sin not unto death</b> (not having death for its issue: within the limit of that <i>unrighteousness</i>, from all of which God cleanseth all those who confess their sins, ch. i. 9).<br><br>Our <i>first </i>canon of interpretation of the <i>sin unto death</i> and the <i>sin not unto death</i> is this: that <i>the </i><b>death </b><i>and the</i> <b>life</b><i> of the passage must correspond.</i> The former cannot be bodily death, while the latter is eternal and spiritual life. This clears away at once all those Commentators who understand the sin unto death to be one for which bodily death is the punishment, either by human law generally, or by sickness inflicted by God; or of which there will be no end till the death of the sinner, which Bede thinks possible, and<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v8mh3vIt2y__dt7EP0uPa2Navj-agDlp/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 2, Part 2, Page 568:</a></h3><br>Lyra adopts. This last is evidently absurd, for how is a man to know whether this will be so or not ?<br><br>Our <i>second </i>canon will be, that this sin unto death being thus a sin leading to eternal death, being no further explained to the readers here, must be presumed <i>as meant to be understood by what the Evangelist has elsewhere laid down</i> concerning the possession of life and death. Now we have from him a definition immediately preceding this, in ver, 12. <i>“He that hath the Son hath life: he that hath not the Son of God, the life hath he not.”</i> Aud we may safely say that the words <b>unto death</b> here are to be understood as meaning, “involving the loss of <i>this life</i> which men have only by union with the Son of God.” And this meaning they must have, not by implication only, which would be the case if any obstinate and determined sin were meant, which would be a sign of the fact of severance from the life which is in Christ [see iii, 14, 15, where the inference is of this kind], but directly and essentially, i.e. in respect of that very sin which is pointed at by them. Now against this canon are all those interpretations, far too numerous to mention, which make <i>any</i> atrocious and obstinate sin to be that intended. It is obvious that our limits are thus confined to <i>abnegation of Christ</i>, not as inferred by its fruits otherwise shewn, but as the act of sin itself. And so, with various shades of difference as to the putting forth in detail, most of the best Commentators both ancient and modern.<br><br>Our <i>third </i>canon will help us to decide, within the above limits, what especial sin is intended. And it is, that by the very analogy of the context, it must be <i>not a state of sin, but an appreciable </i>ACT <i>of sin</i>, seeing that that which is opposed to it <i>in the same kind</i>, as being not unto death, is described by <i>“if any man see his brother sinning, &c.”</i> So that all interpretations which make it to be a <i>state </i>of apostacy, do not reach the matter of detail which is before the Apostle’s mind.<br><br>In enquiring what this is, we must be guided by the analogy of what St. John says elsewhere. <i>Our</i> state being that of life in Jesus Christ, there are those who have gone out from us, not being of us, ch. ii. 19, who are called “<i>antichrists,</i>” who not only “have not” Christ, but are Christ’s enemies, denying the Father and the Son [ii. 22], whom we are not even to receive into our houses nor to greet [2 John 10, 11]. These seem to be the persons pointed at here, and this the sin: viz. the denial that Jesus is the Christ, the incarnate Son of God. This alone of all sins bears upon it the stamp of severance from Him who is the Life itself. As the confession of Christ, with the mouth and in the heart, is salvation unto life [Rom. x. 9], so denial of Christ with the month and in the heart, is sin unto death. This alone of all the proposed solutions seems to satisfy all the canons above laid down. For in it, the life cast away and the death incurred strictly correspond: it strictly corresponds to what St. John has elsewhere said concerning life and death, and derives its explanation from those other passages, especially from the foregoing ver. 12: and it is an appreciable act of sin, one against which the readers have been before repeatedly cautioned [ch. ii. 18 ff., iv. 1 ff., v.5, 11, 12]. And further, it is in exact accordance with other passages of Scripture which seem to point at a sin similarly distinguished above others: viz. Matt. xii. 31 ff., and, so far as the circumstances there dealt with allow common ground, with the more ethical passages, Heb. vi. 4 ff., x. 25 ff. In the former case, the Scribes and Pharisees were resisting the Holy Ghost [Acts vii. 51], who was manifesting God in the flesh in the Person and work of Christ. For them the Lord Himself does not pray (Luke xxiii, 34): they knew what they did: they went out from God’s people and were not of them: receiving and repudiating the testimony of the Holy Ghost to the Messiahship of Jesus.<h2><u><b>18–20.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Three solemn maxims of </i>the Epistle regarding sin and the children of God and the world, and our eternal life in Christ, <i>are repeated </i>as a <i>close</i> of the teaching of the Apostle. Ver. 18 seems to be not without reference to what has just been said concerning sin. In actual life, even our brethren, even we ourselves, born of God, shall sin, not unto death, and require brotherly intercession: but in the depth and truth of the Christian life, sin is altogether absent. It is the world, not knowing God, which lies under the power of the wicked one: God’s new-begotten children he cannot touch: they are in and<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/109mLu4Aup9gWKAHcOF7X-cv7ABGUPrEI/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

As explained there and in our summary of these verses, there is no real inconsistency with what has been just said. And that there is none, the second member of the verse shews): <b>but he that hath been born of God</b> (literally, he that <b>was born</b> of God. The perfect tense expresses more the enduring abidance of his heavenly birth, and fits better the <i>habitual</i> meaning of the words <b>sinneth not</b>: the mere past tense calling attention to the historical fact of his having been born of God, fits better the fact that the wicked one toucheth him not, that divine birth having severed his connexion with the prince of this world and of evil), <b>it keepeth him</b> (“<i>it,</i>” viz. the divine birth, pointed at in the words <b>born of God</b>. It is this, and not the fact of his own watchfulness, which preserves him from the touch of the wicked one: as in ch. iii. 9, where the same is imported by “<i>his seed abideth in him.</i>” The rationalistic Commentators insist on the reading, “<i>he keepeth himself,</i>” as shewing, as Socinus, “that he himself does and contributes something:” and the orthodox Commentators have but a lame apology to offer. Düsterdieck compares “<i>purifieth himself,</i>” ch. iii. 3. But the reference there is wholly different—viz. to a gradual and earnest striving after an ideal model; whereas here the <b>keeping</b> must be, by the very nature of the case, so far complete, that the wicked one cannot approach: and whose self-guarding can ensure this even for a day? Compare John xvii. 15, <i>“that thou shouldest keep them from the evil,”</i> which is decisive), <b>and the wicked one</b> (Satan) <b>doth not touch him</b> (of course the words must not be understood as saying that he is not tried with <i>temptation </i>by the evil one: but imply that, as the Prince of this world had nothing in our blessed Lord, even so on His faithful ones who live by His life, the Tempter has no point d’appui, by virtue of that their birth, by which they are as He is, “The malignant one approaches them,” says Bengel, “<i>as a fly the candle</i>, —but hurts them not, nor even touches them”).<h2><u><b>19.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Application</i> of that which is said ver. 18, to the Apostle and his readers: and that, in entire separation from the wicked one, the ruling spirit of this present world. <b>We know</b> (see summary above) <b>that we</b> (not emphatic.

Compare John i. 12, 18, xvii. 2 f., 6 f., 25 f., 2 Cor. iv. 6, Eph. i. 18), <b>that we know </b>(<b>that we know</b> must bear a sort of pregnant sense, of a purpose accomplished or at least secured) <b>the true One </b>(i.e. God: compare John xvii. 3, “<i>that they may know Thee</i> <b>the only true God</b>.” The adjective <b>true </b>is not subjective, but objective, in the sense of <i>genuine</i>, in distinction from every fictitious god. And thus the way is prepared for the warning against all false gods, ver. 21); <b>and we are</b> (again, as in vv. 18, 19, this second member is an independent proposition, not dependent on the “<i>that</i>”) <b>in</b> (see above, on “<i>lieth in,</i>” ver. 19) <b>the true One </b>(viz. God, as above), <b>in His Son Jesus Christ</b> (i.e. by virtue of our being in His Son Jesus Christ: this second <b>in </b>is not in apposition with, but explanatory of the former). <b>This </b>(viz. God the Father: <b>the true One</b>, who has been twice spoken of see below) <b>is the true God, and eternal life.</b> There has been great controversy, carried on principally from doctrinal interests, respecting the reference of the word <b>this</b>: whether it is to be understood as above, or of His Son Jesus Christ, just mentioned. The Fathers who were engaged against Arian error, and most of the orthodox expositors since, regarding the passage as a precious testimony for the Godhead of the Son, have maintained this latter view, rather doctrinally than exegetically. One of the principal Socinianizing expositors, even Episcopins, takes this view, not being able to bear the caprice and tortuousness of the Socinian exegesis. The opposite doctrinal interest has led many of those who deny this application. To these have succeeded another set of expositors with whom not doctrinal but exegetical considerations have been paramount.<br><br>The grounds on which the application to Christ is rested are mainly the following: 1) that the pronoun<b> this</b> most naturally refers to the last-mentioned substantive: 2) that <b>eternal life</b>, as a predicate, more naturally belongs to the Son than to the Father: 3) that the sentence, if understood of God the Father, would be aimless, and tautological. But to these it has been well and decisively answered by Lücke and Düsterdicck, 1) that “<i>this</i>” more than once in St. John belongs not to the nearest, substantive, but to the principal one in the foregoing sentence, e.g. in ch. ii, 22 and in 2 John 7: and that the subject of the whole here has been the Father, who is the true One of the last verse, and the Son is referred back to Him as “<b>His</b> Son,” thereby keeping <i>Him</i>, as the primary subject, before the mind. 2) that as little can “<i>eternal life</i>” be am actual predicate of Christ as of the Father. He is indeed “<i>the life,</i>” ch. i, 2, but not “<b>eternal</b> life.”<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-brc9I3zDhc284LeuFYBFtzORygp2X2E/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And such an expression leading to snch a meaning we have in John xvii. 3, “<i>This is eternal life, that they may know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou didst send</i>.” He is eternal life in Himself, as being the fount and origin of it: He is it to us, seeing that to know Him is to possess it. I own I cannot see, after this saying of our Lord with the words, <b>Thee the only true God</b>, how any one can imagine that tho same Apostle can have had in these words any other reference than, that which is given in those. 3) this charge is altogether inaccurate. As referred to the Father, there is in it no tautology and no aimlessness. It serves to identify the “<i>true One</i>” mentioned before, in a solemn manner, and leads on to the concluding warning against false gods. As in another place the Apostle intensifies the non-possession of the Son by including in it the alienation from the Father also, so here at the close of all, the<i> true God</i>, the fount of <i>eternal life</i>, is put before us as the ultimate aim and end, to be approached <i>in His Son</i>, but Himself the one Father both of Him and of us who live through Him.<h2><u><b>21.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Parting warning against idols.</i> <b>Little children</b> (he parts from them with his warmest and most affectionate word of address), <b>keep yourselves from idols</b> (or more literally, <b>from the idols</b>, viz. which are about you. The <b>idol</b> is properly a figure of an <i>imaginary </i>deity,—while an <i>image</i>, or <i>likeness</i>, is that of some real person or thing made into an object of worship. See Rom. i. 23, 1 Cor. x.19, xii. 2, and especially 1 Thess. i. 9, where, as here, “<i>the living and true God</i>” is opposed to <i>idols</i>. And there seems no justification for the departing from the plain literal sense in this place. All around the Christian Church was heathenism: the born of God, and they that were lying in the wicked one, were the only two classes: those who went out of one, went into the other: God’s children are thus then finally warned of the consequence of letting go the only true God, in whom they can only abide by abiding in His Son Jesus Christ, in these solemn terms,—to leave on their minds a wholesome terror of any the least deviation from the truth of God, seeing into what relapse it would plunge them).<br><h1>Book: 2 John</h1><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11YthmCS6t7JlkVCccHED5kZngjWVXlxo/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

See 1 John iii. 18, and note on iii. 19); <b>and not I alone, but also all who know the truth </b>(there is no need to imit this <b>all </b>to all dwelling in or near the abode of the Writer, or to all who were personally acquainted with those addressed: it is a general expression: the communion of love is as wide as the communion of faith); <h2><u><b>2.</b>]</u></h2> <b>on account of the truth</b> (objective: God’s truth revealed in His Son, see 1 John ii. 4), <b>which abideth in us, and shall be with us for ever</b> (see John xiv. 16,17. These words are a reminiscence of our Lord’s words there, <i>abideth with you, and shall be in you</i>.

God’s <i>grace</i>, His free grace and gift, is extended to men as they are guilty: His <i>mercy</i> is extended to them as they are miserable.” And thus <i>grace</i> always comes first, because guilt must be done away, before misery can be assuaged. <i>Peace</i> is the whole sum and substance of the possession and enjoyment of God’s grace and mercy: see<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-tMOP7td4zMV09vbVf9284njnlYDuH_/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

And now the Apostle proceeds to describe his joy at finding the children of the<i> elect lady</i> walking in truth (ver. 4), and to enforce the commandment, to love one another (5, 6): and this in presence of the fact that many deceivers are in the world, who would rob us of our Christian reward, and of our share in God (7–9). These are not to be treated as brethren, nor greeted, lest we partake of their evil deeds (10, 11).<h2><u><b>4.</b>]</u></h2> <b>I rejoiced greatly</b> (at some definite time <i>perhaps</i>: but it may also be the epistolary form of putting the verb, implying the present only: and this is made more probable by the perfect tense, “<i>I have found,</i>” which follows. See however 3 John 3), <b>that I have found</b> (the most obvious interpretation is, that at some place where the Apostle was, <i>he came upon</i> these who are presently mentioned: as in Acts xviii 2, <i>Paul came to Corinth: and</i> <b>finding</b> <i>a certain Jew, &c.</i>) <b>of thy children </b> (some) <b>walking in-truth</b> (i.e. not only in honesty and uprightness, but in that truth which is derived from and is part of the truth of God in Christ: see above on 1.—Again, there is no hint whatever given that the rest, or that others, of her children were not walking in truth, The Apostle apparently, as above, in some place where he was, lit upon these children of the “<i>lady,</i>” and sends her their good report. Respecting the rest, he makes no mention nor insinuation), <b>according as we received commandment from the Father</b> (viz. to walk in the truth: not, as Lücke, to love one another, making this clause a further description of the manner in which they were walking in truth). <h2><u><b>5.</b>]</u></h2> <b>And now</b> (so coupling to what has gone before, 1 John ii. 28. It has also a force of breaking off, and passing to that which is the main subject, or most in the Writer’s thoughts, which here is, that this walking in truth is a walking after God’s commandments in love) <b>I entreat thee</b> (see on <i>entreating </i>and <i>asking</i>, 1 John v.15, 16. Here the <i>entreating</i> carries a mild admonition with it, and assumes that the writer had a right thus to entreat), <b>lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but</b> (as writing to thee) <b>that which we had from the beginning</b> (see on this, 1 John ii. 7, 8), <b>that</b> (i.e. <i>in order that:</i> not merely explanatory here) <b>we love one another</b> (the expression of the commandment in the first person is a mark of gentleness and delicacy: a sign that he who wrote it kept the commandment himself). <h2><u><b>6.</b>]</u></h2> <b>And </b>(the onward course of thought here is highly characteristic of St. John) <b>this is love</b> (<b>love</b> is used in its widest sense, as the sum and substance of all God’s commandments: not only as love to God; nor only as love to the brethren), <b>that </b>(the explicative “<i>that</i>”<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eVePxEmoSwgCsH1BhnhHnNeXd7WcMhDV/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The commandment </b>(the one commandment in which God’s other commandments are summed up) <b>is this, even as ye heard from the beginning that ye should walk in it </b>(“Is this, even that which ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it,” viz. in <i>love</i>.<br><br><b>from the beginning</b>, as above, ver. 5, and 1 John ii. 7). <h2><u><b>7,8.</b>]</u></h2> The condition of Love is Truth, see ver. 3. And the necessity of fresh exhortation to walk in love, in that love whose condition is truth, lies in the fact that there are many deceivers gone forth, denying the Truth: of whom we are to beware, and not, by extending to them a spurious sympathy, to become partakers with them.<h2><u><b>7.</b>]</u></h2> <b>Because many deceivers</b> (makers to wander) <b>went forth</b> (here probably, on account of the past tense, “<i>from us,</i>” as in 1 John ii. 19. In 1 John iv. 1, it is perfect, “<i>are gone forth,</i>” where I have preferred the sense, “are gone forth from him who sent them,” viz. the evil one. Huther prefers this latter sense here also) <b>into the world,</b> [<b>namely</b>] <b>they who confess not</b> (instead of “<i>not confessing,</i>” the Apostle writes <b>they who confess not,</b> thereby not merely characterizing the <i>deceivers</i> as not confessing , but absolutely identifying all who repudiate the confession which follows, as belonging to the class of <i>deceivers</i>) <b>Jesus Christ coming in</b> [<b>the</b>] <b>flesh</b> (<b>coming</b>, altogether timeless, and representing the great truth of the Incarnation itself, as distinguished from its historical manifestation [1 John v. 6], and from the abiding effect of that historical manifestation [1 John iv. 2]. He who denies the <i>coming in the flesh</i>, denies the <i><b>possibility </b></i>of the Incarnation: he who denies the <i>having come</i>, denies its <i>actuality</i>). <b>This </b>(viz. “he that fulfils the above character”) is the deceiver and the anti-christ (see notes on 1 John ii. 18, 22, as to the personal relation of these “<i>many</i>” to the one great Antichrist of prophecy. The word <b>this</b>, pointing to a class, makes each one of these, in his place, a representative and “precursor of Antichrist”).<h2><u><b>8.</b>]</u></h2> The warming is suddenly introduced without any coupling particle, and becomes thereby so much the more solemn and forcible. <b>Look to yourselves</b> (<b>yourselves</b> here probably implies not as Bengel, <i>during my absence</i>, but “yourselves,” as contrasted with the deceivers, that ye too become not as they), <b>that ye lose not the things which ye wrought</b> (the reading of this is somewhat uncertain. We had better give the explanation of all three forms, 1) <i>“that </i><b>ye</b><i> lose not the things which </i><b>we</b><i> wrought,”</i> i.e. that ye, Christian converts, lose not that your Christian state of truth and love which we, Apostles and Teachers, wrought in you. The Apostles were God’s <i>workmen</i>, Matt. ix. 37; 2 Tim. ii. 15: <i>the false apostles were crafty workmen</i>, 2 Cor. xi. 13; <i>bad workmen</i>, Phil. iii. 2: the true <i>work </i>was to cause men to believe on Christ, John vi. 29: and this <i>work</i> the false teachers put in peril of loss. If 2) the whole be in the first person, “<i>that</i> <b>we</b> <i>lose not the things which </i><b>we</b><i> wrought,</i>” then the <i>apostolic</i> reward, the souls which are to be their hire, must be understood: if 3) in the secend,—<i>“that </i><b>ye</b><i> lose not the things which </i><b>ye</b><i> wrought,”</i> —no human merit, but the reward laid up for faithfulness, and for every thing done in His name, must ho understood, which is reckoned of grace, and not of debt), <b>but receive reward in</b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tU91Ojc4l09AdHfixVfoTfxpfqWRHa7R/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Nor indeed does it fare much better if the other reading be taken).<h2><u><b>9.</b>]</u></h2> Explanation of this <i>loss</i>, that it is the non-possession of God, which is incurred hy all who abide not in Christ's teaching. <b>Every one that goeth before</b> [<b>you</b>] (such I believe to be the meaning of the somewhat difficult word here used: every one who would set up for a teacher, <i>going before</i> <i>the sheep</i>, as John x. 4, and they following.

This is far more likely than that of Christ should be objective, as Bengel [“in doctrine which teaches that Jesus is the Son of God”], and others: and thus we have the personal genitive after <i>doctrine</i> wherever it occurs in the New Test.: see Matt. vii. 28: Mark iv. 1: John xviii, 19: Acts ii. 42), <b>hath not God</b> (see 1 John ii. 23, v. 12, notes): <b>he that abideth in the doctrine, that man hath both the Father and the Son </b>(see as above. The order is the theological one, the Father being mentioned first, then the Son).<h2><u><b>10, 11.</b>]</u></h2> The exercise of the love of brethren is conditioned and limited by the truth: and is not to be extended to those who are enemies and impugners of the truth. Those who harbour or encourage such, make common cause with them, and their evil deeds. <h2><u><b>10.</b>]</u></h2> <b>If any cometh unto you, and bringeth not</b> (the <i>indicative mood,“cometh,” “bringeth,”</i> shews that the case supposed actually existed: that such persons were sure to come to them: compare, in the revised text, John xi, 12; 2 Cor. ii, 5; 1 John iv. 11. It is not the same as if with a junctive mood, “<i>if any come, and bring:</i>” which always carries a purely hypothetical force, corresponding to an interrogation, whereas the other corresponds to an assertion) <b>this doctrine</b> (the expression, “<b>bringeth</b> <i>not this doctrine,</i>” points out the person as a teacher, not a mere traveller seeking hospitality. The original implies that he not only comes without this doctrine, but by so doing, brings the contrary doctrine.

It is the participation which the host in such a case would incur with them and their antichristian designs, by encouraging them. And this is further impressed by the caution against saying <i>good speed</i> to them: which is a further intensification of the exclusion from the house, and forms a climax,—do not even by wishing him good speed, which, if spoken by a Christian, would mean <i>God</i> speed,— identify yourselves with his course and fortunes. If you do, you pronounce approval of his evil deeds, and so far share his guilt, advancing their success by your wishes for it.<br><br>This command has been by some laid to the fiery and zealous spirit of St. John, and it has been said that a true Christian spirit of love teaches us otherwise. But as rightly understood, we see that this is so. Nor are we at liberty to set aside direct ethical injunctions of the Lord’s Apostles in this manner. Varieties of individual character may play on the surface of their writings: but in these solemn commands which come up from the depths, we must recognize the power of that One Spirit of Truth which moved them all as one. It would have been better for the Church now, if this command had been observed in all ages by her faithful sons).<h2><u><b>12, 13.</b>]</u></h2> CONCLUSION. <b>Having many things to write unto you, I would not</b> [<b>communicate</b> <b>them</b>] <b>by means of paper and ink</b> (<b>paper</b>, says Lücke, the Egyptian papyrus, probably the so-called Augustan or Claudian,—<b>ink</b>, that made of soot and. water thickened with gum, —<b>pen</b> [see 3 John 13], the writing-reed, probably split, —were the New Testament writing materials): <b>but I hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to month </b>(so “<i>face to face,</i>” 1 Cor. xiii, 12), <b>that your joy may be filled full</b> (see 1 John i, 4: viz. by hearing from the mouth of the Apostle himself those messages of life and truth which he forbore writing now: not merely, as some think, by his bodily presence only: still less, because the Apostles were unwilling to commit all their teaching to writing, but reserved many things to oral teaching only, as some Roman-Catholic Commentators, than which it is hardly possible to imagine a sillier comment: for <i>the First Epistle was written</i> with this very same view, ch.i. 4). <b>There greet thee the children of thine elect sister</b> (these words are variously interpreted according as the <i>kyria</i> is understood of a lady, or of a church.

Some would understand that Demetrius had done much for the truth, and his deeds were his witness: but this is hardly a witness of <i>the truth</i> to him. Others take refuge in the extraordinary supposition, that the Holy Spirit had revealed to the Apostle the truth respecting Demetrius. Huther regards the testimony borne by the truth to be that furnished by <b>all</b>, whose evidence was decisive, not from their credit as men. but because they all spoke of and from the truth of Christ dwelling in them.

Origen says, “In the Ascension of Moses, of which book the Apostle Jude makes mention in his Epistle, Michael the archangel, disputing with the devil concerning the body of Moses, says...” No such tradition is found in any apocryphal or rabbinical book now extant. In the targum of Jonathan on Deut. xxxiv. 6, it is stated that the grave of Moses was given into the special custody of Michael. Some have given an allegorical interpretation, understanding by <b>the body of Moses </b>the law, or Jewish polity, or even people: and, thus interpreting, fix the occasion very variously: at the giving of the law: at the siege under Hezekiah, or the rebuilding under Zerubbabel. All such explanations are of course out of the question: and the literal, matter of fact alone to be held fast. It is, however, remarkable, that the same words, <b>The Lord rebuke thee</b>, are spoken by the angel to the devil in Zech. iii. 1–3. This has led some, e.g. Bede, to imagine, that this was the occasion referred to, when Joshua and Satan stood as adversaries concerning the deliverance of Israel from captivity. The only straightforward conclusion is, that St. Jude took the incident from primitive tradition, which tradition, slightly modified, is also given by the prophet Zechariah. That the incident is related as matter of fact, and not as an “argumentum ad hominem,” is evident by the very form of it. That, being thus related as matter of fact, it <i>is </i>matter of fact, is a conclusion which will or will not be made, according as we are or are not, persuaded of the authenticity of our Epistle as a part of canonical Scripture: and according as we esteem that canonical Scripture itself).<h2><u><b>10.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Contrast of the behaviour of these persons to that just related.</i> 2 Pet. ii. 12. <b>These on the other hand, whatever things they know not, speak evil of</b> (the reference in <i>whatever things they know not</i> is to the spiritual world.

Here, the word need not be taken in any but this its general sense, as in 2 Cor. xii. 1, where it is plural; the particular purpose of this revelation follows) <b>of Jesus Christ</b> (how is this genitive to be understood? Is our Lord the subject or the object? Clearly here the former: for it is not Christ who is here revealed, except in a remote sense: but Christ who reveals, as is plain in what follows), <b>which God</b> (the Father) <b>gave to Him</b> (Stern asks, “How are we to understand this? Is not Christ very God, of one essence with the Father from eternity? Did He not, by virtue of the omniscience of His divine nature, know as exactly as the Father, what should be the process of the world’s history, what the fate of the Church? What purpose was served by a revelation from God to Jesus?” He proceeds to say that the words cannot refer merely to the revelation as made to <i>us</i>, but are clearly against such an interpretation: and gives, at some length and very well, that which in one form or other all will accept as the true explanation, in accordance with John vii. 16, xiv. 10, xvii. 7,8. The man Christ Jesus, even in His glorified state, receives from the Father, by his hypostatic union with Him, that revelation which by His Spirit He imparts to His Church. For, Acts i. 7, the times and seasons are kept by the Father in His own power: and of the day and the hour knoweth no man, not the angels in heaven, nor even the Son, but the Father only, Mark xiii. 32. I may observe, that the coincidence in statement of this deep point of doctrine between the Gospel of St. John and the Apocalypse, is at least remarkable), <b>to shew</b> (is this infinitive of the purpose dependent on the verb <b>gave</b>, or on the substantive <b>revelation</b>? Is it the purpose of God in giving, or the purpose of the revelation in revealing, that is asserted? At all events, Heinrichs is wrong, who takes together, <i>“which God gave </i>[empowered]<i> Him </i>to shew.” But of the others, the construction with <b>gave</b> is the more probable, as being the more usual: “that He might shew,” &c. And the verb <b>shew </b>must not here be confined to its stricter meaning of shewing in vision: for then we must confine the reference of <i>“his servants”</i> to the Apocalyptic Seer alone: but must be taken in its wider sense of exhibiting as knowledge, informing of. So in Matt. xvi. 21) <b>to His </b>(<i>Christ's</i>, most probably, as below in this verse, and ch. ii. 20: for thus the <b>He </b>is kept to the same subject throughout) <b>servants </b>(here meaning all Christians,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oFOxsHujztCWUVJNgsyLhRY08BzOxRGC/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

This expression must not be urged to signify that the events of apocalyptic prophecy were to be close at hand: for we have a key to its meaning in Luke xviii. 8, where our Lord says, <i>“Shall not God avenge His elect, which cry unto Him day and night, even if He is </i><b>long-suffering</b><i> with them? I say unto you that He will avenge them </i><b>shortly</b>:” where long delay is evidently implied. Hengstenberg, repudiates this, and says it is self-evident that these words can only be adduced here “by a wrong method of interpretation.” But surely the two cases are exactly parallel: and his strong language here, as elsewhere, proves nothing. His own interpretation of the words, natural as he seems to think it, is forced and unwarrantable. He (in common with many others) takes them to mean that the events spoken of would very soon <i>begin </i>to take place, The axe, he says, lay at the root of the Roman Empire when John wrote this, as it did at the root of the Persian Empire when Daniel wrote. But this interpretation is not borne out by the Greek. The words cannot signify “which must soon <i>begin </i>to come to pass,” but, “which, in their entirety, must soon come to pass.” So that we are driven to the very same sense of <b>shortly </b>as that in Luke xviii. above, viz. to <i>God's speedy time</i>, though He seem to delay: in spite of the scorn which Hengstenberg pours on this meaning. His maxim, that a Prophet, speaking to men, must speak according to men’s ideas, is quite worthless, and may be confuted by any similar prophetic saying, even by the one which he brings in its favour, Hagg. ii. 7: and his complaint, that thus we make the Seer and even the Lord Himself like bad physicians who delude their patients with false hopes [so, in the main, Stern also], is unworthy of a Christian Expositor, after our Lord’s own plain use of the same method of speech again and again in His prophecies in the Gospels and in this book. It remains to observe, that these words cannot with any fairness be used as furnishing a guide to the interpretation of the prophecy. They are far rather to be regarded as a prophetic formula, common with Him to whom a thousand years are as one day, and used in order to teach us how short our time, and the time of this our world, is. See on the whole, Fbrard’s able note, and his remarks on the absurdity of Hengstenberg’s pressing the words in favour of his præterist. scheme); <b>and He</b> (<i>Jesus Christ</i>, not <i>God</i>, see ch. xxii, 16: the subject is changed, and the relative construction abandoned. So almost all Commentators) <b>signified [it] sending by His angel</b> (the Angel mentioned is the same who informs the Seer in chap. xvii. 1, 7, 15, xix. 9, xxi. 9, xxii. 1, 6, which latter place takes up this; ib. 8 ff.; and who is spoken of by our Lord ib. 16. It is remarkable that this angel docs not appear as the imparter of the visions until ch. xvii. Some indeed, as Ewald, have fancied that they trace his presence in ch. Iv. 1 and throughout: but ch. Xvii. 1 is too manifestly the introduction to a new appearance for this to be the case; and previously to that the Seer receives his information from different persons. Our Lord Himself opens the Apocalyptic vision; but it is another voice which calls John up to the place of heavenly vision, ch. iv. 1. In vii. 13, one of the four and twenty elders speaks to him: in x. 8, it is the former voice again which addresses him, and in ib. 9, it is the angel who stands on the earth and the sea that gives him the book. Only in the great close of the prophecy, opening with ch. xvii., does one angel stand by him; referred to, as here, under the name <b>the angel</b>. In the visions of Daniel and Zechariah an angel mediated: Dan. viii. 16, ix. 20, x. 10 ff., Zech. i. 1, 19, al.) <b>to His servant John </b>(on the whole question of the writer of the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gRQo-RJ6dDzxkTaioydSGPAaAET8ZS2/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The reasons given by Ebrard for such reference will not hold: see my Greek Test. Besides, the Evangelist distinctly tells us, John xx. 30, that in writing his Gospel, he did not set down <b>as much as he saw</b>, but only a portion of the things which Jesus did in the presence of His disciples, whereas in the case of this Revelation it was otherwise: he set down all which he saw, as a faithful transmitter of the Apocalyptic vision to the churches).<h2><u><b>3.]</u></h2> Blessed is</b> (or <i>be</i>, in the ordinary meaning of <b>blessed</b>: not necessarily referring on to eternal blessedness, as Hengst.) <b>he that readeth, and they that hear the words of the prophecy and observe the things written in it; for the time is near </b>(it can hardly be reasonably denied that in the terms, <b>he that readeth</b>, and <b>they that hear</b>, the Apostle had in his mind the one public reader and the many hearers. And so the great majority of Commentators. If the words are to be thus understood as above, they form at least a solemn rebuke to the most unjustifiable practice of the Church of England, which omits with one or two exceptions the whole of this book from her public readings. Not one word of the precious messages of the Spirit to the Churches is ever heard in the public services of a Church never weary of appealing to her <i>Scriptural </i>liturgies. Surely it is high time, that our timid rulers should gather courage to face their duties, and such an omission should be supplied.— Notice that not three classes of persons, but two only, are here indicated: he that reads, and they that hear and do.<br><br><b>those things which are written therein</b> are the several exhortations to repentance, faith, patience, obedience, prayer, watchfulness, stedfastness, which are scattered up and down in the prophecy. The <i>time being near </i>makes the book of the more importance. and the blessedness of reading and observing it greater. The <i>nearness </i>spoken of is to be understood as alluding to the <b>shortly </b>of verse 1, which see. We know little now of relative nearness and distance in point of time: when the day of the Lord shall have opened our eyes to the true measure, we shall see, how near it always was).<h2><u>CH. I. 4—III. 22]</u></h2> INTRODUCTION TO THE PROPHECY, in the form of a <i>sevenfold Epistle</i> to the seven churches of Asia, And herein, vv. 4, 5, <i>address and greeting</i>, ending with <i>doxology</i>. [Ebrard, who seems to love singularity for its own sake, objects to the above arrange- ment, because the sevenfold epistle has not yet begun, and prefers calling this a dedicatory title to the whole book. But the other view is far simpler and better. The sevenfold Epistle is clearly before St. John’s mind, and, full of the images of the vision which he had seen, he only interrupts it by solemn ejaculatory references to the glories of that vision and the sublime announcement of the Lord’s coming, and then hastens on to introduce it by a prefatory account of his own circumstances when the Epistles were entrusted to him, and of the appearance of the Lord who thus entrusted them.] <b>John to the seven churches which are in Asia</b> (the form of address is exactly that in the Epistles of St. Paul: see Rom. i. 1 ff., 1 Cor.i.1 ff., &c. That St. Paul, in Romans and elsewhere, is careful to designate himself and his office, and St. John introduces himself without any such designation,<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3SFHwOQcjvShRinvCO0ZFyebI2oIWTc/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

See this, and other evidence as to the authorship, urged in the Introduction. See on the seven churches below, ver. 11. <b>Asia</b>, as always in the New Test., is the proconsular province so called. It consisted of Phrygia, Mysia, Caria, and Lydia: under Mysia and Lydia including Ionia and Æolia, and the neighbouring islands of the Ægean. It was called proconsular, because it was governed by one of consular rank, under the title of proconsul): <b>Grace be to you and peace</b> (so St. Paul in all his Epistles except the three pastoral) <b>from Him who is and who was and who is to come</b> (a paraphrase of the unspeakable name <i>Jehovah</i>, resembling the paraphrase “I AM THAT I AM” in Exod. iii. 14, for which the Jerusalem Targum has, as here, “HE WHO WAS AND IS AND IS TO COME:” as has the Targum of Jonathan in Deut. xxxii. 39. It follows from what is remarked above, that the meaning of <b>is to come</b> is not here to be pressed as referring to any future <i>coming</i>. By doing so we should confuse the meaning of the compound appellation, which evidently is all to be applied to the Father. By some <b>He which is</b> is sup- posed to mean the Father, <b>which was</b> the Son [“<i>in the beginning</i> <b>was </b><i>the Word</i>”), and <b>which is to come</b> the Spirit, as ever proceeding forth and descending on the Church), <b>and from the seven spirits which [are] before His throne</b> (Audreas takes these for the seven principal angels [ch. viii. 2]: so also many other Commentators. But this is highly improbable, as these angels are never <i>called </i>“<b>spirits</b>,” and as surely mere creatures, however exalted, would not be equalized with the Father and the Son as fountains of grace. The common view is doubtless right, which regards the seven as <i>the energies of the Holy Spirit:</i>— “Thou the anointing Spirit art, Who dost thy sevenfold gifts impart:” but rather perhaps to be regarded as expressing His plenitude and perfection, than to be separately assigned as [but query?] in the lines following of the hymn Veni Creator Spiritus. The key to this expression, which is an anticipation of the visions afterwards to be related, is ch. v. 6, where see notes: as also on ch. iv. 5. The <b>seven </b>can hardly be entirely without allusion to the <i>seven churches</i>, and to the <i>sevenfold </i>imagery throughout. The number seven denotes completeness, and was much noted by the Jewish Commentators as occurring in the Old Test. The seven spirits betoken the completeness and universality of working of God’s Holy Spirit, as the seven churches typify and indicate the whole church. The reference to Isa. xi. 2 is but lamely made out, there being there but <i>six</i> energies of the Spirit mentioned. That to Zech. iv. 2, 10 is more to the point: see notes as above), <b>and from Jesus Christ</b> (as we have before had the Father and the Holy Spirit mentioned as the sources of grace and peace, so now the Son, coming last, on account of that which is to follow respecting Him, which has respect to His threefold office of Prophet, King, and Priest: see however below), <b>the faithful witness </b>(see John xviii, 37, “<i>To this end came I into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.</i>” It is to the general mission of the Redeemer to bear witness to the truth, and not merely to the apocalyptic portion of His testimony which is to follow, that this title must be referred.

As there St. John evidently shews what a deep impression the whole circumstance here referred to produced on his own mind, so it is remarkable here that he should again take up the prophecy of Zechariah [xii. 10] which he there cites, and speak of it as fulfilled. That this should be so, and that it should be done with the same word <b>pierced him</b>, not found in the Septuagint version of the passage, is a strong presumption that the Gospel and the Apocalypse were written by the same person. The persons intended in this expression are beyond doubt those to whom our Lord prophesied in like terms, Matt. xxvi. 64; viz. those who were His murderers, whether the Jews who delivered Him to be crucified, or the Romans, who actually inflicted His death. That the meaning must not here be generalized to signify all who have by their sins crucified the Son of God afresh, is plain from the consideration that this class are taken out from among that indicated by <i>“every eye shall see Him”</i> which precedes, whereas on that supposition they would be identical with it; for we all have pierced Him in this sense), <b>and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn at Him</b> (i.e. their mourning shall be directed towards Him as its object: in fear for themselves in regard to the consequences of His coming.<br><br>The prophecy is in allusion to Matt. xxiv. 30; and its sense, that all, even the holiest of men, shall mourn at the visible approach of that day. But as Bengel well remarks, there will be then two causes of mourning: <i>hostile terror,</i> and <i>penitential terror.</i> The former will prevail in the impenitent and careless world; the latter even in the comforted and rejoicing church. The holiest saint, when that Presence is manifested, in the midst of his “Lo, this is our God; we have waited for Him and He will save us,” will personally feel with St. Peter, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord.” The whole is an adaptation and amplification of the words of Zechariah xii. 10). <b>Yea, Amen</b> (both these words are used in 2 Cor. i. 20 as forms of ratification.

Andreas remarks, that the <b>Yea</b> is according to the Greek usage, to shew the unchangeableness of the things said, the <b>Amen</b> according to the Hebrew usage, assuring us that no obstacle shall intervene so as to hinder their fulfilment). <b>I am the Alpha and the Omega, saith the Lord God, He that is and that was and that is to come, the Almighty</b> (by whom are these words spoken?

Indeed from his entire silence respecting himself in his Gospel, we may well believe that here, where mention of his name was absolutely required, it would. be introduced thus humbly and unobtrusively), <b>and fellow-partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance</b> [or, <b>patience</b>] <b>in Jesus</b> (the construction and arrangement are peculiar. The conjunction of these terms seems to be made to express, a partaker, as in the kingdom, so in the tribulation and endurance which are in and by Christ: but the insertion of <b>kingdom </b>between <b>tribulation </b>and <b>endurance</b> is startling. Probably, the tribulation brings in the kingdom [Acts xiv. 22], and then as a corrective to the idea that the kingdom in its blessed fulness was yet present, the endurance is subjoined. “John introduces three portions of inheritances in which he declares himself partaker. But the middle one of these, i.e. the kingdom, cannot be possessed, unless with the exercise of tribulation on the one side, and the defence of patience on the other.” Ambrose Ansbert [8th century]), <b>was </b>(found myself) <b>in the island which is called Patmos</b> (see Introduction, § ii. par. 4) <b>on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus</b> (the substantives form the same expression as occurred before, ver. 2, where see note. There they indicated <i>this</i> portion of the divine word and testimony, of which John was a faithful reporter. Whether their meaning is the same here, will depend partly on what sense we assign to <b>“on account of.”</b> In St. Paul’s usage, it would here signify <i>for the sake of,</i> i.e. for the purpose of receiving: so that the Apostle would thus have gone to Patmos by special revelation in order to receive this revelation. Again, keeping to this meaning, these words may mean, that he had visited Patmos in pursuance of, for the purposes of, his ordinary apostolic employment, which might well be designated by these substantives. And such perhaps would have been our acceptation of the words, but that three objections intervene. 1) From what has preceded in this verse, a strong impression remains on the mind that St. John wrote this in a season of tribulation and persecution. Why should he throw over his address this tinge of suffering given by the tribulation and patience, if this were not the case? 2) The usage of our Writer himself in two passages where he speaks of death by persecution [ch. vi. 9, xx. 4] shews that with him <b>on account of</b> [or, <b>for</b>] in this connexion is <i>“because of,”</i> <i>“in consequence of.”</i> And St. John’s own, usage is a better guide in St. John’s writings, than that of St. Paul. Besides which, Origen’s Greek ear found no offence in this usage, for he incorporated it into his own sentence, ... “He condemned John in his testimony, on account of the word of truth, to the island Patmos.” 3) An early patristic tradition relates that St. John was banished to Patmos. See the authorities in the Introduction, and the question discussed, whether we are justified in ascribing this tradition solely to our present passage. These considerations, mainly those arising from the passage itself, compel us, I believe, to understand the words of an exile in Patmos).<h2><u><b>10, 11.]</u></h2></b> <b>I was</b> (“Je me trouvais:” not merely <i>“I was,”</i> but <i>“I became”</i>) <b>in the Spirit</b> (i.e. in a state of spiritual ecstasy or trance, becoming thereby receptive of the vision or revelation to follow.

Ebrard well says, “Connexion with surrounding objects through the senses is suspended, and a connexion with the invisible world established.” On the attempt made by some to give the words a different meaning, see below) <b>on the Lord’s day</b> (i.e. on the first day of the week, kept by the Christian church as the weekly festival of the Lord’s resurrection. On any probable hypothesis of the date of this book, this is the earliest mention of the day by this name. This circumstance, coupled with a bias in favour of a peculiar method of interpretation, has led certain modern interpreters, of whom, as far as I know, Wetstein was the first, to interpret the words of the day of <i>the Lord’s coming.</i> So Züllig, and in our own country, Drs. S. R. Maitland and Todd. But 1) the difficulty of the thus early occurrence of this term, <i>“the Lord’s day,”</i> is no real one. Dr. Maitland says [sce Todd’s Lectures on the Apoc., Note B, p. 295], “I know of nothing in the Scripture or in the works of the ante-Nicene Fathers on which to ground such an assumption.” To this we may answer, that the extent of Dr. Maitland’s knowledge of the ante-Nicene Fathers does not, happily for us, decide the question: as the expression occurs repeatedly in those very Fathers: see the citations in my Greek Test. Mr. Elliott, Hor. Apoc. iv. 367 note, has pointed out that the primitive Syriac version renders 1 Cor. xi. 20, “not as befitteth the day of the Lord ye eat and drink,” which is an interesting proof of the early usage. This chronological objection being disposed of, and the matter 2) taken on its own merits, it really is astonishing how any even moderate Greek scholars ean persuade themselves that the words can mean that which these Commentators maintain. See this shewn in my Greck Test.): <b>and I heard a voice</b> (see Ezek. iii. 12) <b>behind me</b> (Isa. xxx. 21),<b> great as of a trumpet, saying</b> (the trumpet is the instrument of festal proclamation, Numb. x. 10: John ii. 15, &c.: accompanies divine manifestations, Exod. xix. 19 f.; Joel ii. 1: Matt. xxiv. 31; 1 Thess. iv. 16. The similarity to the sound of the trampet here was it the loudness and clearness of the voice: see also ch. iv. 1. From this latter it appears that this voice was not that of our Lord, but of one who there also spoke to the Apostle. Düsterdieck remarks that <b>behind me</b> leaves an indefiniteness as to the speaker), <b>What thou seest </b>(the present carries on the action through the vision now opening,—<i>“what thou art seeing”</i>) <b>write </b>(forthwith) <b>into a book, and send to the seven churches, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamus, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea</b> (for all particulars respecting these churches, see the Introduction, § ii.).<h2><u><b>12—20.]</u></h2></b> THE VISION, i<i>n which our Lord appears to St. John, and the command is repeated.</i> This vision is the introduction, not only to the messages to the churches, but to the whole book : see further on ver. 19.<h2><u><b>12.]</u></h2></b> <b>And I turned about to see the voice which was speaking with me</b> (the voice, the acting energy, being used to signify the person whose<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j2atCm3KZDEQNFKFcgqjbrRPdKEJj5Pq/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Again, in Zech. iv. 2. 11, we have the <i>“candlestick, all of gold,”</i> with its seven lamps, Here there are seven separate candlesticks, typifying, as that <i>one</i>, the entire church, but now no longer bound together in one outward unity and one place. Each local church has now its candlestick, to be retained or removed from its place according to its own works):<h2><u><b>13.]</u></h2> and in the midst of the candlesticks one like to the Son of Man</b> (i.e. to Christ: see John v. 27: not simply, <i>“to a son of man”</i>)<b>, clothed in a garment reaching to the feet</b> (see the reff. in Daniel and Ezekiel, which the description and even the diction closely resemble. This long garment was a sign of high rank or office. Arethas supposes the dress to be that of the Melchisedek-priesthood; but without reason. See Ecclus. vii. 8, “If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and <i>put her on, as a glorious long robe”</i>), <b>and girt round at the breasts with a golden girdle</b> (in Dan. x. 5, Gabriel has his <i>loins</i> girt with gold of Uphaz. Some suppose a distinction—the girding round the loins betokening activity, while that round the breast is a sign of repose. But Hengstenberg well observes that this would hardly apply: for Christ is here in fulness of energy as ruler and orderer of His Church. Ebrard seems nearer the truth in regarding the higher girding as a sign of majesty. But perhaps after all the point is not to be pressed; for the angels in ch. xv. 6 are also girt <i>round the breasts</i>. Nor is the golden girdle distinctive of regal majesty: for this they also bear, ibid.):<h2><u><b>14.]</u></h2> and his head and his hairs [were] white like white wool, as snow</b> (by the <b>head </b>is perhaps indicated the forehead; not the face, which is afterwards described. It is only in colour, not in material, that His hair is compared to white wool; and the words, <b>as snow</b>, are afterwards added to impress this still more. The whiteness signifies <i>purity </i>and <i>glory</i>, not as Augustine and others think, <i>eternity,</i> either here or in Dan. vii. 9), <b>and his eyes as a flame of fire</b> (so Dan. x. 6: representing perhaps, as Vitringa says, “the perspicacity of the divine and pure mind, piercing all secrets.” This may be, notwithstanding that Gabriel has eyes like lamps of fire in Daniel. Though <i>omniscience</i> could not be ascribed to him, the figure might be relatively consistent. But it is perhaps better to consider these physical details rather as in themselves characteristic, than as emblematic of attributes lying beneath them. The “fiery eye” among the sons of men, is indicative of energy and power of command: so also in the Son of man Himself):<h2><u><b>15.]</u></h2></b> <b>and his feet were like to chalcolibanus</b> (so literally. This word has defeated all the ingenuity of Commentators hitherto.

So Dan. x.6; Ezek. xliii. 2, where the same expression is found, i. 24, where the sound of the wings of the creatures is <i>“as the noise of great water”</i>).<h2><u><b>16.]</u></h2> And having</b> (St. John takes up the description from time to time irrespective of the construction, as if with separate strokes of the pencil) <b>in his right hand seven stars</b> (not <i>on </i>his right hand, as a number of jewelled rings, but <i>in</i> his right hand, as a wreath or garland, held in it. De Wette well remarks that <i>this</i>, which is the more natural rendering, is also required by the symbolism. If the seven churches which the seven stars symbolize, were <i>on </i>the Lord’s hand as rings, they would seem to be serving (adorning ?) Him, and not to be the objects of his action: but now that He <i>holds them in</i> his hand, He appears as their Guardian, their Provider, their Nourisher: and, we may add, their Possessor, who brings them out and puts them forth to be seen when He pleases. His universal Church would hardly be thus represented, but only a portion of it which it pleases Him to take in his hand and hold forth as representing the rest): <b>and out of his mouth a two- edged sharp sword going forth</b> (compare Isa. xi. 4, xlix, 2: also our ch. ii. 16, and Wisd. xviii. 15. The same figure occurs with reference to <i>men </i>in Ps. lv. 21, lvii. 4, lix. 7: and examples of it are given from the Rabbinical writings. The thing signified may perhaps be as in 2 Thess. ii. 8, and in ch. xix. 21; but clearly we must not exclude the attributes of the <i>word of God</i>, Heb. iv. 12, Eph. vi. 17. And this all the more, inasmuch as 1) here the Lord is represented not as taking vengeance on his enemies, but as speaking with his own, both in the way of comforting and of threatening: and 2) in ch. xix. 21, where this very sword is again alluded to as slaying the Lord’s enemies, His title as sitting upon the horse is <i>“the word of God”</i>):<b> and his countenance</b> (not <i>general appearance</i>. Had this been so, how should the Apostle have noted the details just mentioned? for the whole figure of our Lord would have been too dazzling for him to contemplate. It is natural that after describing the eyes, and that which proceeded from the mouth, he should give the general effect of the countenance) <b>as the sun shineth in his strength</b> (sce Judges v. 31: —that is, when unclouded and in full power: not necessarily at midday, but at any time. The construction is again broken: <i>“as the sun shining”</i> would be the regular connexion).<h2><u><b>17, 18.]</u></h2></b> <b>And when I saw Him, I fell at his feet as dead</b> (the effect of the divine appearance: see Exod. xxxiii. 20; Job xlii. 6; Isa. vi. 5; Ezek. i. 28; Dan. viii. 17 ff., x. 7 ff. There is no discrepancy in this bodily action with the spiritual nature of the vision, as De Wette thinks, either here or in the places where similar physical effects are described. ch. v. 4, xix. 10, xxii. 8 [Dan. vii. 15]. Düsterdieck well remarks in reply, that the <i>being in the Spirit</i> does not supersede existence in the body. Just as dreamers express their bodily feelings by physical acts, e.g. by starting or weeping, so might St. John while in this ecstasy : see Acts ix. 3). <b>And he placed his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not</b> (see Dan. x. 12, Luke i. 13, 30, ii. 10, Matt. xvii. 7, Mark xvi. 6.

By this mention of His own death and revival, the Lord reassures His Apostle.

The Targum of Jonathan on Deut. xxviii. 12 says, “There are four keys in the hand of the Lord . . . the key of life, of the tombs, of food, and of rain” We have the <i>gates</i> of death as opposed to the gates of the daughter of Zion, Ps. ix. 14; cf. also Job xxxviii. 17; and the gates of Hadés, Matt. xvi. 16, Isa. xxxviii. 10).<h2><u><b>19.]</u></h2> Write therefore</b> (‘because I have vouchsafed thee this vision,—I whose majesty is such, and whose manifested loving-kindness to thee.” ‘The connexion is better thus than with ver. 11, as some: “Now that thy fear is over, write what I bade thee.” But it is very doubtful whether ver. 11 is spoken by our Lord at all: see there) t<b>he things which thou sawest </b>(just now: the vision which was but now vouchsafed thee), <b>and what things they are</b> (two meanings of the words thus rendered are possible. 1) <i>‘the things which are,’</i> viz. which exist at the present time.

Very many both ancient and modern Commentators take them for the <i>presiding presbyters</i>, or <i>bishops</i>, of the churches. This view is variously supported. It derives probability from the analogy of the vision itself, in which, seeing that the candelabra represent the churches themselves, existing vessels containing much light, the stars, concentrated sparks of light, should represent some actually existing persons in or connected with the churches. Again it is supported by our finding that throughout the seven Epistles the angel is treated as representing and responsible for the particular church. But before we pass on to the other great section of interpretation, we may at once dismiss those forms of this one which make the <i>angel </i>the <i>ideal representative</i> of the governing body, or an <i>ideal messenger</i> from the church, or an anticipatory idea of the office of Bishop, not yet instituted : or, in short, any idealism at all. As the <i>church </i>is an objective reality, so must the <i>angel </i>be, of whatever kind. This consideration will also affect the current of interpretation which takes the angels to be <i>the churches themselves</i>. The second line of interpretation is that which regards them as <i>angels</i>, in some way representing the churches. In favour of this is 1) the constant usage of this book, in which the word <b>angel </b>occurs only in this sense: 2) the further usage of this book, in which we have, ch. xvi. 4, the <i>angel of the waters</i> introduced without any explanation, who can be none other than the angel presiding over the waters: 3) the expression of our Lord Himself, Matt. xviii. 10, <i>“their angels in heaven do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven,”</i> coupled with that expressed by the church in the house of Mary the mother of John Mark, Acts xii. 15, with regard to their disbelief of Peter standing at the door, <i>“it is his angel :”</i> both asserting the doctrine that angels are allotted to persons, and are regarded as representing them: a subject full of mystery, and requiring circumspect treatment, but by no means to be put aside, as is commonly done. 4) The extension of this from individuals to nations in the book of Daniel, which is so often the key to apocalyptic interpretation. See Dan. x. 21, xii. 1: an analogy according to which there might well be angels not only of individuals, but of churches. 5) The fact that throughout these Epistles, nothing is ever addressed individually as to a teacher, but as to some one person reflecting as it were the complexion and fortunes of the church ina way in which no mere human teacher or ruler could. That there is no exception to this in ch. ii. 20, see maintained in note there. 6) To the objection advanced in the comment of Arethas, that “<i>the presiding angel had not sinned</i>, so as to want exhorting to repent, &c.,” the reply may be made, with advantage to this interpretation, that there evidently is revealed to us a mysterious connexion between ministering angels and those to whom they minister, by which the former in some way are tinged by the fates and fortunes of the latter. E. g. in our Lord’s saying cited above, the place of dignity there asserted of the angels of the little children is unquestionably connected with the character of those whose angels they are: and it cannot be following out such a revelation too far to say that, if some of the holy angels are thus and for this reason advanced to honour, others may be similarly, and for the opposite reason, placed in less honour and relatively disgraced. That this idea is found expressed in the Rabbinical writings is a mark of the further development of the truth, which seems to have been first revealed to Daniel. 7) It will be perceived that this interpretation does not lie under any of the objections stated above as idealizing that which ought to be an objective reality. For it contemplates the angels of the churches as really existent, not as ideal beings. It is only when this latter is the case, that those objections can apply. 8) It will also be perceived, that both the circumstances, which were cited as making for the former interpretation, tell equally for this: viz. a) that just noticed, the actual existence of these persons in or belonging to the churches, and b) the fact that in the Epistles the angel is treated as representing and responsible for the particular church.<br><br>So that I cannot but regard this second<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W7N2f4MgFxoy6uPkO_3o8H241G63K5CF/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Views have considerably differed respecting the character of these Epistles, whether they are to be regarded as simply historical, or historico- prophetical, or simply prophetical. The point on which all, I presume, will be agreed is, that the words contained in these Epistles are applicable to and intended for the guidance, warning, and encouragement of the whole Church Catholic, and its several parts, throughout all time. The differing interpretations will here be only briefly alluded to. One account of them will be found in Vitringa’s (Latin) Commentary, pp.27—58: and (but scantily, as most interpreters pass over this portion of the book slightly) in the introductions to the principal commentaries. See also Abp. Trench’s Appendix to his Commentary on the Seven Epistles, pp. 209—225.<br><br>Before commenting on each individual Epistle, I would notice the similar construction of all. This may be thus described. Each Epistle contains, 1. A command, to write to the angel of the particular church. 2. A sublime title of our Lord, taken for the most part from the imagery of the preceding vision. 3. An address to the angel of the church, always commencing with <i>I know</i>, introducing a statement of its present circumstances: continuing with an exhortation either to repentance or to constancy : and ending with a prophetic announcement, mostly respecting what shall be at the Lord’s coming. 4. A promise made to <i>“him that overcometh,”</i> generally accompanied with a solemn call to earnest attention, <i>“He that hath an ear, &c.”</i><h2><u><b>1—7.]</u></h2></b>—THE EPISTLE TO THE CHURCH AT EPHESUS. <b>To the angel of the church in Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth fast</b> (compare ch. ii. 25, iii.11) <b>the seven stars in his right hand, He that walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks of gold </b>(assertions of Christ’s being the Lord, the Governor and the Upholder of His Church, agreeably to the vision of ch. i.: coming in suitably in this first Epistle, as beginning the complete number): <b>I know </b>(am aware of: not as some explain it, <i>approve</i>.

It would have been well for the church, had this always been remembered. <b>the works</b>, see below, must be referred to the moral delinquencies of this sect) <b>of the Nicolaitans </b>(there has been much dispute who these were. The prevailing opinion among the fathers was, that they were a sect founded by Nicolaus the proselyte of Antioch, one of the seven deacons. But there early becomes evident a desire to vindicate Nicolaus the deacon from the opprobrium of having been the founder of such a sect; and in consequence we soon find another Nicolaus substituted for the deacon of that name. An apocryphal Acts of the Apostles speaks of a Corinthian of this name, infamous for licentious practices. We come now to the second principal view with regard to this sect, which supposes their name to be symbolic, and Nicolaus to be the Greek rendering of Balaam, and to mean,<i> “He ruined, or absorbed the people.”</i> Consequently the name Nicolaitans is said to be equivalent to Balaamites, as is also inferred from ver. 14. This view seems first to have been broached by Heumann in 1712, and since then has been the prevailing one. But in the first place, the names are by no means parallel; and next, the view derives no support from ver. 14 f., where the followers of Balaam are distinct from the Nicolaitans: see note there. And besides, there is no sort of reason for interpreting the name otherwise than historically. It occurs in a passage indicating simple matters of historical fact, just as the name Antipas does in ver. 13. If we do not gain trustworthy accounts of the sect from elsewhere, why not allow for the gulf which separates the history of the apostolic from that of the post-apostolic period, and be content with what we know of them from these two passages? There is nothing repugnant to verisimilitude in the report mentioned by the Fathers, that Nicolaus fell into impurities; nor need all of those who were chosen to aid the Apostles in distributing alms, have been even to the end of their lives spotless and infallible. At least it may be enough for us to believe that possible of one of them, which the post-apostolic Fathers did not hesitate to receive), <b>which I also hate</b> (this strong expression in the mouth of our Lord unquestionably points at deeds of abomination and impurity: compare Isa. lxi. 8; Jer. xliv. 4; Amos v. 21; Zech. viii. 17).<h2><u><b>7.]</u></h2></b> Solemn conclusion of the Epistle. <b>He that hath an ear </b>(no fanciful distinction must be imagined between the singular, and the plural which is found in the Gospels [Matt. xi. 15, xiii. 9, &c.].

The promise, and its expression are in the closest connexion with our Lord’s discourse in John vi., as will be seen by comparing Gen. iii. 22. But we need not therefore say that Christ <i>is </i>the tree of life here, nor confuse the figure by introducing one which in its character is distinct from it. Still less is the tree to be interpreted as being the Holy Spirit. See, for the imagery, ch. xxii. 2, 14, 19. The words <b>of God</b>, as following <i>paradise</i>, come from Ezek. xxviii. 13, and set forth the holiness and glory of that paradise, as consisting in God's dwelling and delighting in it).<h2><u><b>8—11.]</u></h2></b> THE EPISTLE TO THE CHURCH AT SMYRNA. <b>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna</b> (in accordance with the idea of the angel representing the bishop, many of the ancient Commentators have inferred that Polycarp must have been here addressed. Whether this were chronologically possible, must depend on the date which we assign to the writing of the Apocalypse. He was martyred in A.D. 168, 86 years after his conversion) <b>write; These things saith the first and the last, which was</b> [became] <b>dead and revived</b> (see ch. i. 17, 18. The words here seem to point on to the promise in verses 10, 11): <b>I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty </b>(in outward wealth, arising probably from the <i>tribulation</i>, by the despoiling of the goods of the Christians); <b>nevertheless thou art rich </b>(spiritually; see 2 Cor. vi. 10, ch. iii. 18, and James ii. 5): <b>and </b>(I know) <b>thy calumny from</b> (arising from) <b>those who profess themselves to be Jews, and they are not, but </b>[<b>are</b>] <b>Satan's synagogue</b> (these slanderers were in all probability actually Jews by birth, but not [see Rom. ii. 28; Matt. iii. 9; John viii. 33; 2 Cor. xi. 22; Phil. iii. 4 ff.] in spiritual reality; the same who every where, in St. Paul’s time and afterwards, were the most active enemies of the Christians. When Polycarp was martyred, we read that “all the multitude of Gentiles and Jews dwelling in Smyrna cried out, enraged with a loud voice:” and afterwards when faggots were collected for the pile, “the Jews most eagerly, as is their wont, giving help.” This view is strengthened by the context. Had they been, as some have supposed, Christians, called <i>Jews </i>in a mystical sense, they would hardly have been spoken of as the principal source of calumny against the Church, nor would the collective epithet of <i>Satan’s synagogue</i> be given to them. Abp. Trench brings out there, how <i>church</i>, the nobler word, was chosen by our Lord and His Apostles for the assembly of the called in Christ, while <i>synagogue</i>, which is only once found [James ii. 2] of a Christian assembly [and there, as Düsterdieck notes, not with <i>of God</i>, but <i>your</i>], was gradually abandoned entirely to the Jews, so that in this, the last book of the canon, such an expression as this can be used.

Ephesus. And so Vitringa and Bengel.

The expression is relevant, as the context shews, merely to the then existing state of the city, and not to any future part which it should take in the fulfilment of prophecy): <b>and thou holdest fast my name</b> (the profession of thy faith in Me), <b>and didst not deny the faith of me in the days of Antipas ny witness</b> (martyr), <b>my faithful one, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth</b> (of Antipas, the shortened form of Antipater,—after the analogy of Hermas for Hermodorus, Lucas aud Silas for Lucanus and Silvanus,—nothing is known to us with certainty, except from this passage. Andreas (cent. vi.) says that he had read the account of his martyrdom: and Arethas (cent. x.) says, that his “martyrdom” was still extant. Ribera gives an account from Simeon Metaphrastes, that he was bishop of Pergamus, and lived to extreme old age: and that when a persecution arose, in the time of Domitian, after having frequently witnessed a good confession he suffered death by being scorched in a hot brazen bull. The Greek and Roman martyrologies contain similar accounts at his day, April 11th.

We may remark, 1) that it is most according to the sense of the passage to understand these sins in the case of the Nicolaitans, as in that of those whom Balaam tempted, literally, and not mystically : 2) that the whole sense of the passage is against the idea of the identity of the Balaamites and the Nicolaitans : and would be in fact destroyed by it.

Others again think of the precious stones bearing the names of the twelve tribes on the breastplate of the High Priest, the order for which was contemporary with the giving of the manna, Exod. xxviii. 17; xxxix. 10, and regard this as indicating the priestly dignity of the victorious Christian, Ebrard remarks, that as the hidden manna was the reward for abstaining from idol- meat, so this for abstinence from fornication. Again Arethas and others have reminded us of the Gentile custom of presenting the victors at the games with a stone or ticket which entitled them to nourishment at the public expense, and to admission to royal festivals. Hence they regard the white stone as the ticket of admission to the heavenly feast. But it may be replied, 1) the feast is mentioned separately under the name of the hidden manna: and 2) the description of the writing on the stone, which follows, will not suit this view. Again, others, regarding the connexion of the white stone with the manna, refer to the use of the lot cast among the priests, <i>which </i>should offer the sacrifice: or to the writing a name, at election by ballot, on a stone or a bean: or to the custom of <i>absolving </i>criminals with a white stone and condemning them with a black one. Some expositors combine two or more of these expositions.<br><br>But it is against all these interpretations, that no one of them fits the conditions of this description. Each one halts in the explanation either of the stone itself, or of that which is written on it. Least of all, perhaps, does the last apply; the verdict of <i>acquittal </i>would be a strange reward indeed to one who has fought and overcome in the strength of an acquittal long ago obtained, Col. iii. 13. The most probable view is that which Bengel gives a hint of, and which Hengstenberg and Düsterdieck hold, that the figure is derived from the practice of using small stones, inscribed with writing, for various purposes, and that, further than this, the imagery belongs to the occasion itself only. Taking it thus, the colour is that of victory, see ch. iii. 3; vi. 2; iv. 4; xix. 14. The <i>name inscribed</i> yet remains for consideration. It is in this, as it would be in every case, the inscription which gives the stone its real value, being, as it is, a token of reward and approval from the Son of God. But <i>what name</i> is this? not what name <i>in each case</i>, for an answer to this question is precluded by the very terms, “<i>which none,</i> &c.:” but<i> of what kind?</i> Is it the name of Christ Himself, or of God in Christ? This supposition is precluded also by the same terms: for any mysterious name of God or of Christ would either be hidden from all [so ch. xix. 12], or known to all who were similarly victorious through grace. These very terms seem to require that it should be the recipient's <i>own name</i>, a <i>new </i>name however; a revelation of his everlasting title, as a son of God, to glory in Christ, but consisting of, and revealed in, those personal marks and signs of God’s peculiar adoption of <i>himself</i>, which he and none else is acquainted with. “If the heart knoweth its own bitterness, and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy” [Prov. xiv. 10], then the deep secret dealings of God with each of us during those times, by which our sonship is assured and our spiritual strife carried onward to victory, can, when revealed to us in the other blessed state, be known thoroughly to ourselves only).<h2><u><b>18—29.]</u></h2></b> THE EPISTLE TO THE CHURCH AT THYATIRA. <b>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God</b> (our Lord thus names Himself here, in accordance with the spirit<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uUe4FSsAEogjqZLBKROK1CFnvAQY0spg/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

It could not well have been <i>inserted</i>: and was sure to have been erased, from its difficulty, and possibly from other reasons, considering what was the common interpretation of the <i>angel</i>. It does not create any real difficulty: finding its meaning not in the matter of fact at Thyatira, but in the history from which the appellation <b>Jezebel</b> is taken. In 1 Kings xxi. 25 we read, <i>“Ahab, who did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord : whom Jezebel his wife stirred up:”</i> from which text the phrase is transferred entire, importing that this Jezebel was to the church at Thyatira what that other was to Ahab. It is not so easy to determine who is, or who are, imported by the term. The very fact of the name, Jezebel being chosen [for it is impossible, even were this the actual name of a woman, that it should be used here with any other than the symbolic meaning], coupled with <b>thy wife,</b> as above explained, takes us out of the realms of simple fact into those of symbolism. The figure of “Jezebel thy wife” being once recognized in its historical import, it would not be needful that an individual woman should be found to answer to it: the conscience of the Thyatiran church could not fail to apply the severe reproof to whatever influence was being exerted in the direction here indicated. So that I should rate at very little the speculations of many Commentators on the supposed woman here pointed out. Düsterdieck, recently, remarks that the expression,<b> which calleth herself a prophetess</b>, has something individual about it. So it has: but may not this individuality belong just as well to the figure, as to the thing signified by it? The sect or individuals being once concentrated as <b>Jezebel</b>, this expression would follow of course, in the propriety of the figure. On the whole, however, I should feel it more probable that some individual <i>teacher</i>, high in repute and influence at the time, is pointed at. The denunciation of such a teacher under such a title would be at once startling and decisive. Nor would probability be violated by the other supposition, that a favoured and influential party in the Thyatiran church is designated.

This specification of the mischief done shews us that this influence at Thyatira was in the same direction as the evil works of the Nicolaitans at Pergamus, ver. 14. The fact that this was the prevalent direction of the false teaching of the day, is important in a chronological point of view: see Introduction, § iii. par. 6). <b>And I gave her time</b> (not, “in my pre-ordination of what is to be,” as in Mark xiii. 20, but denoting historically that which the Lord had actually done, in vain.

So most Commentators. Perhaps the threat has reference to a future pestilence. Some understand the bed to be future punishment, referring to Isa. xiv. 11), <b>and those who commit adultery </b>(not now <i>fornication</i>, but a more general term, embracing in its wide meaning both the fornication and eating things sacrificed to idols, and well known as the word used of rebellious and idolatrous Israel, Jer. iii. 8, v. 7; Ezek. xvi. 32 &c.) <b>together with her</b> (not those who <i>commit adultery with her,</i> Dut those who, as well as she, commit adultery: those who share with her in her adulteries.

The historical figure is obviously dropped here) <b>I will slay with death </b>(the expression is probably a rendering of the Hebrew idiom, which the Septuagint renders by <i>“to kill with death,”</i> and which occurs Lev. xx. 10, in reference to adultery.

But it seems doubtful whether so minute a distinction is in the words; whether they are not rather a general designation for the whole inward part of a man): <b>and I will give to you</b> (‘will render, in My doom of judgment.’ The strain of the Lord’s message is suddenly changed into a direct ad- dress to those threatened) <b>to each according to your works</b> (not the mere outward products of the visible life, but the real acts and verities of the inward man, discerned by the piercing eye of the Son of God).<h2><u><b>24.]</u></h2></b> <b>But </b>(contrast to those addressed before) <b>to you I say, the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as have not</b> (not only do not <i>hold</i>, but are free from any contact with) <b>this teaching, such as have not known the depths</b> (deep places) <b>of Satan, as they call them </b>(it was the characteristic of the falsely named <i>Gnosis </i>[Knowledge], to boast of its <i>Bathea</i>, or depths, of divine things.

So far would be true enough; but the sentence would thus be left very flat and pointless, and altogether inconsistent in its tone with the solemn and pregnant words of the rest of the message. If the words <b>as they call them</b> belong to the <i>heretics</i>, we have our choice between two views of the words <b>of Satan</b>: either 1) that the heretics themselves called their own mysteries <b>the depths of Satan</b>.

This has been the sense taken by most Commentators. And it appears to me that this alone comes in any measure up to the requirements of the passage, in intensity of meaning and solemnity, as well as in likelihood); <b>I cast not upon you any other burden </b>(to what do the words refer? There can, I imagine, be little doubt as to the answer, if we remember some of the expressions used in the apostolic decree in which these very matters here in question, fornication and abstaining from unholy meats, were the only things forbidden to the Gentile converts. For our Lord here takes up aud refers to those very words. In Acts xv. 28 we read, <i>“It seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us</i> to lay upon you no greater burden <i>than these necessary things, that ye abstain from meats offered fo idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.</i>” This act of simple obedience, and no deep matters beyond their reach, was what the Lord required of them. And this <i>burden</i> resolved itself into keeping the faith once delivered to the saints, as enjoined in the next sentence. The word has been very variously understood:—of the trouble given them by Jezebel and her followers: —of the punishments about to befall the heretics, which were not to be feared by the Christians:—of the burden of previous suffering implied in the word <b>patience</b> above,—and of the sense of “burden,” so often occurring in the prophets when they denounce the divine threatenings. But to my mind the allusion to the apostolic decree is too clear and prominent to allow of any other meaning coming into question: at least any other which sets that entirely aside. Others may be deduced and flow from that one, which have meaning for the church now that those former subjects of controversy have passed away): <b>but</b> (“<i>only:</i>” i.e., forget not that the licence just accorded involves this sacred obligation) <b>that which ye have</b> (see ch. iii. 11: not to be restricted in its sense to their stedfastness in resisting Jezebel and hers, but representing the sum total of Christian doctrine and hope and privilege; the <i>“faith once for all delivered to the saints”</i> of Jude 3), <b>hold fast</b> (the word in the original sets forth not so much the continuing habit, as the renewed and determined grasp of every intervening moment of the space prescribed) <b>until the time when I shall come</b> (the original gives an uncertainty when the time shall be, which we cannot convey in our language).<h2><u><b>26.]</u></h2> And</b> (the announcement of reward to the conqueror <i>now first</i> precedes the proclamation to hear what the Spirit saith to the churches: and is joined, <i>here alone</i>, by “<b>and</b>” to the preceding portion of the Epistle; being indeed more closely connected with it in this case than in any of the others: see below)<b> he that conquereth and he that </b>(by this second designation this second class is precluded from being taken as merely explanatory of the first, and is specified as included in it) <b>keepeth to the end</b> (it is remarkable, that immediately after the words, so pointedly alluded to above, in the apostolic decree, Acts xv. 28, was added, <i>from which if ye </i><b>keep </b><i>yourselves, ye shall do well</i>) <b>my works</b> (contrast to <b>her </b><i>works</i>, ver. 22: but extending beyond that contrast to a general and blessed truth. <b>My </b><i>works</i>, i.e. which belong to Me, are the attributes of Myself and of Mine), <b>I will give to him authority over the nations</b> (compare the words, “<i>Have thou </i><b>authority </b><i>over the cities,</i>” Luke xix. 17, which is the reward of him who obeyed the command, <i>“Occupy</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EZl53zGU0aZG8MlQB2V6zROBu-g59BMo/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The saying, as rendered by them, is sanctioned by being thrice quoted in this book, see ch. Xii. 5, xix. 15) <b>them with a rod of iron </b>(a sceptre of severity: ie. of inflexible justice), <b>as the vessels of pottery are broken up</b> (crushed, or shivered: the original gives the idea of the multitudinous fragments collapsing into an heap: the “broken to shivers” of the A.V. is very good), <b>as I also have received from my Father</b> (viz. in Ps. ii. 9, in which Psalm it is said, <i>“Thou art my Son,”</i> ver. 7. The power there conferred on Me, I will delegate to my victorious servant). <b>And I will give to him the star of the morning</b> (it is not easy to say what, in strict exactness, these words import. The interpretations given are very various and inconsistent. The early Expositors, Andreas and Arethas, Understand it of the Lucifer of Isa. xiv. 12, i.e. the devil, whom our Lord saw as lightning fall from heaven.—or, as there imported, the King of Babylon, the most powerful monarch on earth. Another ancient meaning given is the day-star arising in the hearts of the faithful, spoken of by St. Peter, 2 Pet. i. 19. Victorinus (century iv.) says it is <i>the first resurrection.</i> Many others, ancient and modern, understand Christ Himself, who, ch. Xxii. 16, declares Himself to be <i>the bright and morning star:</i> and doubtless, as has been before remarked on the fruit of the tree of life, ver. 7, and on the hidden manna, ver. 17, in the mystical sense, Christ Himself is the sum and inclusion of all Christ’s gifts: this truth serves to connect the symbolism of all these passages, but does not justify us in disturbing that of one by introducing that of another. Here the morning star clearly is not Christ Himself, the very terms of the sentence separating the two. Then again, we have Lyra’s interpretation, the glorious body; Grotius’s, that it is brightness as much exceeding all other, as the morning star excels the other stars. And this interpretation is probably near the mark. In Dan. xii. 3 we read that the righteous shall shine <i>as the stars,</i> and in Matt. xiii. 43 that they <i>shall shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.</i> And in Prov. iv. 18, we read that “the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.” Still, this interpretation does not quite satisfy the words <b>I will give him:</b> unless indeed the poetic imagery be, that he is imagined as clad in the glory of that star, putting it on as a jewel, or as a glittering robe. De Wette supposes that the star is to be given to him as its ruler: but such an interpretation would lead into a wide field of speculation which does not seem to have been opened by Scripture, and is hardly required by the passage itself). <h2><u><b>29.]</u></h2></b> See above, on ver. 7.<h1><u>CHAP.

We have mention in ch. i. 4 of the seven spirits which are before God's throne: and we there found occasion to interpret them of the plenitude of the Godhead in its attributes and energies. See, for further elucidation, ch. iv. 5, v. 6. These spirits, this plenitude, Christ, the Lord of the Church, possesses, is clothed and invested with, in all fulness. From Him the spiritual life of his churches comes as its source, in all its elements of vitality. He searches all the depths both of our depravity and of His own applications of grace. He has in his hand all the Spirit’s power of conviction. He wields the fire of purification and the fire of destruction. Whether the Spirit informs, or rebukes, or warns, or comforts, or promises, whether He softens or hardens men’s hearts, it is Christ who, searching the hearts as Son of God and feeling their feelings as Son of man, wields and applies the one and manifold Spirit.<br><br>The designation here has its appropriateness in the whole character of this solemn Epistle. The Lord of the Church comes, armed with all the powers of the Spirit; searching the depths of hypocrisy, judging of the worthlessness of works not done in faith. The difficulty of this general attribute of Christ, and not any one selected specially as applying to Sardis being here introduced, seems to be best accounted for, not, as Ebrard, by the general prophetic import of the Epistle, but by the fact that. the minatory strain of the Epistle justities the alleging the whole weight and majesty of the divine character of our Lord, to create alarm and bring about repentance), <b>and the seven stars</b> (the former symbolism [ch i. 16, 20] still holds in all its strictness. Nor have we the least right here, as some do, to suppose that the stars and the spirits are identical. The motive mentioned above would fully account for this designation also: The Lord of all the churches: He who appoints them their ministering angels, and has them, and all that is theirs, in His hand): <b>I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest</b> (I need only mention for warning the childish fancy, that the Bishop of Sardis was named Zosimus or Vitalis (<i>living</i>). The expression explains itself: thou hast a repute that thou livest: art <i>nominally</i>, as we commonly now say, Christian), <b>and </b>(the mere copula carries the contrast far more vividly and pathetically than when it is made rhetorically complete by inserting “yet”) <b>art dead</b> (spiritually dead: void of vitality and fruitfulness: sunk in that deep deadly sleep which, if not broken in upon and roused up, is death itself: so St. Paul, Eph. v. 14). <b>Be</b> (literally, <b>become</b>: because a change is involved: become what thou art not) <b>watchful</b> (we can hardly help in English substituting the adjective for the participle “watching;” thereby losing objective vividness, and getting instead a subjective attribute of character. “Awake and watch” would be, in paraphrase, tantamount to the text), <b>and strengthen the remaining things, which were</b> (the time is transferred to that indicated by the fulfilment of the command: which were, when thou shalt apply thyself to strengthen them) <b>about to die</b> (there is a question whether these <i>remaining matters </i>are to be understood as <i>things</i>, matters in which the Sardian church was not yet totally without spiritual vitality, or as <i>persons</i>, who were not yet passed into the almost universal death-slumber of hypocrisy. The latter view is taken by very many Commentators. And there is nothing in the construction to preclude it. But if I mistake not, there is in the context. For to assume that the <i>persons remaining </i>could be thus described, would surely be to leave no room for those mentioned with so much praise below in ver. 4.<b> Had the things which remain</b> not occurred, we might have well understood <i>“strengthen those that were ready to die,”</i> of confirming those thy weak members who ow account of the general deadness were near losing their spiritual life altogether: but<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tNXOlEBjYEiKz3AcIFChZVVPtULNetAt/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

An allusion to Zech. iii. 3 ff. is far more obvious. <b>with me</b>, in remarkable accord with our Lord’s prayer in John xvii. 21, “<i>Father, I will that they whom Thou hast given Me, where I am, there they also may be </i><b>with me:</b>” see also Luke xxiii. 43), <b>for they are worthy</b> (the <i>worthiness </i>here is found in the terms of the sentence itself. They have <i>kept their garments undefiled:</i> they of all others then are the persons who should walk in the glorious white robes of heavenly triumph. Exactly thus in ch. xvi. 5, 6, <i>“They shed blood, and thou gavest them blood to drink:</i><b> they are worthy.</b>” To dream of any merit here implied, is not only to miss, but to run counter to the sense of the whole saying and situation. The absence of defilement is only explained by ch. vii. 14, <i>“They washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb:”</i> and as Vitringa excellently says, “Un<i>worthiness</i> here marks the proportion and congruency which was between the state of grace in which they had been on earth, and of the glory which the Lord had decreed for them according to the measure of this very law of grace”). <b>He that conquereth, he </b>(the reading “<i>he that conquereth</i> <b>thus</b>,” found in so many MSS., seems to have arisen originally in a very usual confusion of the long and short <i>o</i> in Greek, and then to have been retained, from not being altogether without meaning; “<i>thus</i>,” i.e. as those first mentioned) <b>shall be clad in white garments </b>(the concluding promise takes the hue of what had gone before, and identifies those just spoken of with these victorious ones): <b>and I will not wipe out his name out of the book of life</b> (this again takes its colour from the preceding. Those who have a name that they <i>live</i>, and are dead, are necessarily wiped out from the book of <i>life</i>: only he whose name is a living name, can remain on those pages. Here again the Rabbinical expositors have gone wrong in imagining that the genealogical tables of the priests are alluded to. Far rather is the reference to the ordinary lists of citizens, or of living members of any body or society, from which the dead are struck out. Thus they whose names have been once inscribed in this book, whether by their outward admission into Christ’s church in baptism, or by their becoming living members of Him by faith, if they endure to the end as His soldiers and servants, and obtain the victory, shall not, as all His mere professed members shall, have their names erased from it. The figure itself, of the book of life, is found as early as Exod. xxxii. 32 f.); <b>and I will his name in the presence of my Father and in the presence of his angels </b>(see Matt. x.32; Luke xii. 8, both of which are here combined: see also Luke ix. 26; Mark viii. 38.

In Isa. xxii. 22, it is said of Eliakim son of Hilkiah, <i>“The key of the house of David will I lay upon his shoulder ; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open:”</i> which is manifestly the passage here incorporated into the Lord’s message: and the sense is that whatever inferior degrees there may be of this power of opening and shutting the church [<i>the house of David</i>, with reference to the false Jews below], the supreme power, the one true key, belongs to the Lord Christ alone. It is hardly justified, and serves but little purpose, to attempt to set up a distinction between “the key <i>of David</i>” here, and “the key of <i>the house of David</i>” in Isaiah. The key is the same in both cases: but the One possesses, it as his own by right, the other has it merely entrusted to him; laid on his shoulder. See on the whole sense, Matt. xvi. 19), <b>who openeth, and no one shall shut; and shutteth, and no one shall open</b> (these words are to be taken not merely of the power of Christ to forgive sins, but generally, as indeed the next ver. requires. Christ only has power to admit into and exclude from His kingdom; to enlarge the work and opportunities of His church, and to contract them): <b>I know thy works</b> (these words stand by themselves; not as connected with what follows below, the intervening sentence, “<i>behold, ... shut,</i>” being considered parenthetical.<br><br>They are words of comfort and support to the Philadelphian church):<b> behold, I have given before thee a door opened</b> (i.e. have granted, in my possession and administration of the key of David, that a door should stand opened. The door is variously understood: but most Expositors take it to mean, as in 1 Cor. xvi. 9; 2 Cor. ii. 12; Col. iv. 3 [otherwise in Acts xiv. 27], an opportunity for the mission work of the church. And this appears to be the true sense here, by what follows in ver. 9, promising conversion of those who were now foes.<br><br><b>before thee,</b> because the course is naturally <i>forward</i>), <b>which no one is able to shut: because</b> (gives the reason of what preceded; the Lord will confer this great advantage on the Philadelphian church, <i>because...</i>) <b>thou hast little power</b> (not as A.V. <i>“a little strength,”</i> thereby virtually reversing the sense of the words: the original importing <i>“thy strength is but small,”</i> and the A.

Düsterdieck takes it as used of that great proof which Christ gave of His love by dying for His church, appealing to the same tense in Eph. v. 25; Gal. ii. 20; 1 John iv. 10, 11. But thus we lose the especial reference to the particular church which seems to be involved in the recognition. It is the love bestowed on the Philadelphian church, in signalizing its success in the work of Christ, that these converted enemies shall recognize). <b>Because thou didst keep the word of my endurance</b> (or, <b>patience</b>: the word preached to thee, enjoining that endurance which belongs to Me and mine, see ch. i. 9), <b>I also</b> (I on my side: the <b>also </b>expressing reciprocity) <b>will keep thee</b> (<b>thee</b>, emphatic and prominent) <b>from </b>(from out of the midst of: but whether by <i>immunity from</i>, or by <i>being brought safe through</i>, the preposition does not clearly define)<b> the hour of temptation</b> (the appointed season of sore trial: literally, <b>of the temptation</b>, of the well-known and signal temptation.

As such, it is immediately connected with <b>I come quickly</b> following), <b>to try them that dwell upon the earth </b>(see ch, viii. 13, &c., where the expression applies to those who are not of the church of Christ. In this great trial, the servants of Christ shall be kept safe, ch. vii. 3. The trial of the <i>temptation </i>will operate in two ways: on the faithful, by bringing out their fidelity; on the unfaithful and unbelieving, by hardening them in their impenitence, see ch. ix. 20, 21, xvi. 11, 21.<br><br>The Expositors have in many cases gone away from this broad and obvious meaning here, and have sought to identify the <i>hour of temptation </i>with various periods of trial and persecution of the <i>Church</i>: a line of interpretation carrying its own refutation with it in the very terms used in the text. Thus Grotius understands it of the persecution under Nero; Lyra, of the future increase of that under Domitian, which was raging as the Apostle wrote: others, of those under Trajan: others again, of the troubles which should arise on account of Antichrist, which is nearer the mark).<h2><u><b>11.]</u></h2> I come quickly</b> (these words, which in different senses and with varying references<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qu39UaU2sLOUnNj_PaZTv6bORA0YumXo/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

In this case it was a rich treasure indeed: compare vv.8, 10), <b>that no one take </b>(snatch away: but here the figure stops: it is not <i>for himself </i>that the robber would snatch it, but merely to deprive the possessor.

That this, and nothing referring to any honour or dignity in the church militant, or in that as leading on to the church triumphant is intended, is manifest from the whole diction of this passage, as well as from comparing the corresponding promises, which all refer to the blessings of the future state of glory. It is no objection to this view, that in the heavenly Jerusalem there is no temple, ch. xxi. 22: but rather a corroboration of it. That glorious city is all temple, and Christ’s victorious ones are its living stones and pillars. Thus as Düsterdieck well remarks, the imagery of the church militant, 1 Cor. iii. 16 ff.; Eph. ii. 19 ff.; 1 Pet. ii. 5 ff., is transferred to the church triumphant, but with this difference, that the saints are no longer the stones merely, but now the pillars themselves, standing in their immovable firmness. On <b>my</b> <i>God</i>, see note on ch. ii. 7), <b>and out of it he shall never more go out </b>(the subject is not the <i>pillar</i>, but<i> he that conquereth; </i>and the sense, that he who is thus fixed in his eternal place as a pillar in the heavenly temple, will never more, from any cause, depart from it. Those Commentators who have understood the promise of the church <i>militant</i>, have been obliged to take the <i>going out</i> as passive, shall not <i>be cast out</i>. Lyra takes it in both senses—“neither by apostasy, nor by excommunication.” And. thus except that the latter word will have no place, we may well understand the general term here used: none shall thrust him out, nor shall he be any more in danger of falling, and thus thrusting himself out. It is well worth noticing the recorded fact, that Philadelphia was notorious for calamities by earthquake. The language in which Strabo deseribes this is remarkable in connexion with this promise of the pillar which should not be moved: “Philadelphia cannot trust to its walls, but day by day they are more or less shaken and crack. And the inhabitants always take into account these accidents of their land, and build with reference to its character.” And still more so in another place: “The city of Philadelphia is fall of earthquakes; the walls are constantly cracking, and some part or other of the city is always in trouble, wherefore the inhabitants are scanty.” Tacitus tells us, that in the reign of Tiberius, when the twelve cities of proconsular Asia were overthrown by an earthquake, Philadelphia suffered, and was in consequence excused its taxes, and in common with the others entrusted to a senatorian commissioner to repair): <b>and I will write upon him</b> (the conqueror; not the pillar) <b>the name of my God</b> (some think of the mitre breastplate of the high priests, on which was inscribed “Holiness to the Lord,” Exod. xxviii. 36.

Christ is the Amen, inasmuch as His words shall never pass away, but shall find certain ratification. This, and not, the particular case which is treated in 2 Cor. i. 20, seems to be the reference here, where not the ratification of promises merely, but general fidelity and certainty are concerned: as Arethas says, “'This is the same as <i>these things saith the true One:</i> for Amen means yea. There is then <i>yea </i>in all things said of Him; i.e, all is truth, and none a lie”),<b> the faithful and true witness</b> (there does not seem in this title to be any allusion to the prophecies which are about to follow in ch. iv. ff. as some have imagined. Far rather does it substantiate the witness borne in the Epistle itself, as we have seen in the case of the other introductions), <b>the beginning of the creation of God </b>(see Col. i. 15, and note. In Him the whole creation of God is begun and conditioned: He is its source and primary fountain-head. The mere word <b>beginning </b>would admit the meaning that Christ is the first-created being: see Gen. xlix. 3; Deut. xxi. 17; and Prov. viii. 22. And so the Arians here take it, and some who have followed them. But every consideration of the requirements of the context, and of the Person of Christ as set forth to us in this book, is against any such view. Düsterdieck asks the questions, “How could Christ write if it were only this present Epistle, if He were himself a creature? How could every creature in heaven and earth adore Him, if He were one of themselves [ch. xix. 10]? We need only think of the appellation of our Lord as the Alpha and Omega [ch. xxii. 13: compare i. 8] in its necessary fulness of import, and we shall see that in the Alpha lies the necessity of His being the <b>beginning </b>of the Creation, in the Omega that of His coming to bring the visible creation to an end”): <b>I know thy works, that</b> (see above, ver. 1, where the construction is the same: I have thy whole course of life before me, and its testimony is, that . . .) <b>thou art neither cold nor hot </b>(the peculiar nse of the similitude of physical cold and heat here, makes it necessary to interpret the former of the two somewhat differently to its common acceptation: so that while<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LVq0xPk4FtbE2OuwlkGiEBNfwZ9sB35Q/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

So that we must, so to speak, go further into coldness for the meaning of <b>cold</b>, and take it as signifying, not only entirely without the spark of spiritual life, but also and chiefly, by consequence, openly belonging to the world without, and having no part nor lot in Christ’s church, and actively opposed to it. This, as well as the opposite state of spiritual fervour, would be an intelligible and plainly- marked condition: at all events, free from that danger of mixed motive and disregarded principle which belongs to the lukewarm state: inasmuch as a man in earnest, be he right or wrong, is ever a better man than one professing what he does not feel. This necessity of interpretation here has been much and properly pressed by some of the later Commentators, but was by the older ones very generally missed, and the coldness interpreted of the mere negative absence of spiritual life): <b>would that thou wert cold or hot: so</b> (expresses the actual relation of facts to the wish just expressed, as not fulfilling it: “seeing that this is not so”) <b>because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I shall soon spue thee out of my mouth</b> (it being the known effect of the taking of lukewarm water, to produce vomiting.<br><br><b>I shall soon</b> is a mild expression, carrying with it a possibility of the determination being changed, dependently on a change in the state of the church).<h2><u><b>17, 18.]</u></h2> </b>In these verses, the <i>lukewarmness </i>is further expanded, as inducing miserable unconsciousness of defect and need, and empty self-sufficiency. And the charge comes in the form of solemn and affectionate counsel. <b>Because</b> (forms the reason of<i> I advise</i> below: <i>seeing that</i>) <b>thou sayest [that] I am rich, and am become wealthy, and have need in nothing</b> (the three expressions form a climax: the first giving the act of being rich, the second the process of baving become so [in which there is not merely outward fact, but some self-laudation: see Hosea xii. 8], the third the result, self-sufficingness. From the whole context it is evident that not, as many have imagined, outward worldly wealth, but imagined spiritual riches, are in question. The imagined spiritual self-sufficingness was doubtless the natural growth of an outwardly prosperous condition: but the great self-deceit of which the Lord here complains was not concerning worldly wealth, which was a patent fact, but concerning spiritual, which was a baseless fiction), <b>and knowest not that thou </b>(emphatic; “thou, of all others ;” corresponding to the use of the articles below) <b>art the wretched and the pitiable one</b> (in both cases, as distinguished above others, as the person to whom above all others the epithets belong.

Yet notwithstanding such cléar warning not to go wrong, the Roman-Catholic expositors have here again handled the word of God deceitfully, and explained, as Lyra, “Buy, ie. with good works;” Cornelius-a-lapide, “The word <i>buy </i>signifies that a man must do many things and contribute many things in order to be fit to receive these gifts from God.” The term, in fact, continues the irony. “All this lofty self-sufficiency must be expended in the labour of getting from Me these absolute necessaries.” So most of the later expositors. So even the Roman-Catholic Stern, but disguising the truth under an appearance of <i>some </i>price being given: “What is the price?

See Acts xii, 13 f., “<i>As Peter knocked at the door</i>”. . . “<i>when she knew Peter's voice.</i>”—In that case we must conceive Rhoda to have asked, “Who is there?” and Peter to have answered, It may not be uninstructive to fill up this connexion in a similar manner. “It is I,” is an answer the soul may often hear, if it will enquire the reason of an unexpected knock at the door of its slumbers; or we may compare Sol. Song, v. 2, <i>“It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me”</i>), <b>and open the door </b>(literally, “shall have heard,” “shall have opened:” but it would he pedantry thus to render in our language. On the sense, see Sol. Song, v. 6.<br><br>Our verse is a striking and decisive testimony to the practical freedom of our will to receive or reject the heavenly Guest: without. the recognition of which, the love and tenderness of the saying become a hideous mockery.<br><br>We then open the door to Christ, when we admit Him, His voice, His commands, His example, to a share in our inner counsels and sources of action. To say that this can be done <i>without </i>His grace, is ignorance: to say it is done only by that grace irresistibly exerted, is far worse,—it is, to deprive His gracious pleadings of all meaning), <b>I will enter in to him, and I will sup with him, and he with me </b>(the imagery is taken from the usages of intimate hospitality. But whereas in these it would be merely the guest who would sup with the host who lets him in, here the guest becomes himself the host, because He is the bread of life, and the Giver of the great feast of fat things and of the great marriage supper [Matt. viii. 11, xxv. 1 ff.; Rev. xix. 7, 9]. St. John is especially fond of reporting these sayings of reciprocity which our Lord uttered; compare John vi. 56 [x. 38], xiv. 20, xv. 4, 5, xvii. 21, 26. This blessed admission of Christ into our hearts will lead to His becoming our guest, ever present with us and sharing in all our blessings— and, which is even more, to our being ever in close union with Him, partaking ever of His fulness, until we sit down at His table in His Kingdom).—<b>He that conquereth</b> (see above, ch. ii. 26, and ver. 12, for the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11aaGewUsSL39WhW5YyUwr8n0jVEgIFqQ/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

By the latter, Christ sat down at the right hand of God, or of the throne of God, as Heb. xii. 2. No distinction must be made between the throne of the Father, on which Christ sits, and that of Christ, on which the victorious believer is to sit with Him: they are one and the same, called <i>“the throne of God and the Lamb,”</i> ch. xxii. 1; and the glory of the redeemed will be a participation in it of the Father and the Son, John xvii. 22).—Doubtless the occurrence of this, the highest and most glorious of all the promises, in this place, is to be explained not entirely from any especial aptness to the circumstances of the Laodicean church, though such has been attempted to be assigned [e. g. by Ebrard —because the victory over lukewarmness would be so much more difficult than that in any other case], but also from the fact of its occurring at the end of all the Epistles, and as it were gathering them all into one. Tt must not be forgotten too, that the words, <b>I sat down with my Father on His throne</b>, form a link to the next put of the book, where we soon, ch. v. 5, 6, read, <b>And I saw in the midst we ‘the throne... a Lamb standing, as it were slain.</b><h2><u><b>22.]</u></h2></b> See on ch. ii. 7.<br><br>From this point begins the Revelation proper, extending to the end of the book.

So that we have,—<h2><u><b>CH.

Henceforth usually he looks from the heaven down on the earth, seeing however both alike, and being present in either, as the localities of his various visions require): <b>and the former voice</b> (much confusion has been introduced here by rendering, as A.

As Düsterdieck observes, all we can say of it is that it is the <i>same voice </i>as that in ch. i. 10, which there, ver. 17, is followed by that of our Lord, not “<i>as of a trumpet</i>,” but “<i>as of many waters</i>,” as stated by anticipation in ver. 15), <b>saying, Come up hither </b>(viz. through the opened door), <b>and I will shew thee</b> (it is surprising how Stier can allege this <b>I will shew thee</b> as a proof that the Lord Himself only can be speaking: compare ch. xxi. 9, 10, xxii. 8, 9, which latter place is decisive against him) <b>the things which must</b> (of prophetic necessity) <b>take place after these things</b> (so literally: viz., the things now present: as in ch. i. 19, but the <i>things </i>not being the same in the two cases. So that <b>after these things</b> has very much the general meaning given by the “<i>hereafter</i>” of the A. V.: this clause corresponds to “which are about to happen after these things” of ch. i. 19).<h2><u><b>2.]</u></h2> Immediately I was </b>(became) <b>in the Spirit</b> (i. e. I experienced a new accession of the Spirit’s powerful influence, which transported me thither: “I was in a trance of ecstasy:” see on ch. i. 10. It is hardly credible that any scholar should have proposed to understand “<i>there</i>” after <b>was</b>, “immediately I <i>was there</i> in the Spirit:” but this was done by Züllig, and has found an advocate in England in Dr. Maitland): <b>and, behold, a throne stood</b> (the A. V. “<i>was set</i>,” gives too much the idea that the <i>placing </i>of the throne formed part of the on: “<i>lay</i>” would be our best word, but we do not use it of any thing so lofty as a throne.

The altar in Canterbury Cathedral stands on a platform of yellow jasper pavement, 30 feet by 14 feet. The <b>sardine </b>is a red stone, commonly supposed to answer to our cornelian. But Epiphanius, in his treatise on the twelve stones in Aaron’s breastplate, says of it, that it is a Babylonian stone, blood red in colour, like the gleam of the <i>sardine </i>fish when pickled, and semi-opaque. Several of the Commentators have said much on the symbolic significance of these stones as representing the glory of God. Thus much only seems, in the great uncertainty and variety of views, to stand firm for us: that if the <b>jasper </b>is to be taken as in ch. xxi. 11, as, by the reference there to <i>the glory of God</i> it certainly seems it must, then it represents a watery crystalline brightness, whereas the <b>sardine </b>is on all hands acknowledged to be fiery red. Thus we shall have ample material for symbolic meaning: whether, as some take it, of the one great judgment by water [or of baptism], and the other by fire,—as others, of the goodness of God in nature [jasper being taken as <i>green</i>] and His severity in judgment,— as Ansbert, of the divinity and humanity [because His humanity at the time of His passion was tinged with blood], &c., or as the moderns mostly, of the holiness of God and His justice. This last seems to me the more probable, especially as the same mixture of white light with fire seems to pervade the Old Testament and Apocalyptic visions of the divine majesty. Compare Ezek. i. 4, viii. 2; Dan. vii, 9: and our ch. i. 14, x. 1. But nothing can be confidently asserted, in our ignorance of the precise import of the <i>jasper</i>): <b>and a rainbow</b> (Gen. ix. 12-17; Ezek. i. 28) <b>round about the throne</b> (i.e. in all probability, surrounding the throne vertically, as a nimbus; not horizontally), <b>like to the appearance of an emerald</b> (on this name, in Greek “<i>smaragdus</i>,” all seem agreed, that it represents the stone so well known among us as the <i>emerald</i>, of a lovely green colour. Almost all the Commentators think of the gracious and federal character of the bow of God, Gen. ix. 12—17. Nor is it any objection to this that the bow or glory here is green, instead of prismatic: the <i>form </i>is that of the covenant bow, the colour even more refreshing and more directly symbolizing grace and mercy, So far at least, we may be sure of as to the symbolism of this appearance of Him that sitteth on the throne: that the brightness of His glory and fire of His judgment is ever girded by, and found within, the refreshment and surety of His mercy and goodness.

But if so, what sort of representatives, and why twenty-four in number? This has been variously answered.

That those sayings do not regard the <i>same </i>session as this, is no argument against the inference from analogy. The Abbot Joachim brings against this view that the twelve patriarchs were not personally holy men, and never are held up as distinguished in the Old Testament. But this obviously is no valid objection. It is not the personal characters, but the symbolical, that are here in question. It might be said with equal justice that the number of the actual Apostles is not definitely twelve. It is no small confirmation of the view, that in ch. xv. 3, we find the double idea of the church, as made up of Old Testament and New Testament saints, plainly revealed to St.John; for he heard the victorious saints sing<i> the song of Moses</i>, aud <i>the song of the Lamb</i>. See also ch, xxi. 12, 14, where the twelve <i>gates </i>of the New Jerusalem are inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes, and its twelve <i>foundations </i>with those of the twelve Apostles.

These seem to represent the Holy Spirit in his sevenfold working: in his enlightening and cheering as well as his purifying and consuming agency. So most Commentators. De Wette and Ebrard regard the representation as that of the Holy Spirit, the principle of physical and spiritual life, which appears only wrong by being too limited. Hengstenberg is quite beside the mark in confidently [as usual] <i>confining </i>the interpretation of the lamps of fire to the consuming power of the Spirit in judgment. The fact of the parallel ch. v. 6 speaking of <i>seven eyes</i>, and such texts as ch. xxi. 23; Ps. cxix. 105, should have kept him from this mistake. The whole of this glorious vision is of a composite and twofold nature: comfort is mingled with terror, the fire of love with the fire of judgment): <b>and before the throne as it were a sea of glass </b>(not, “<i>glassy</i>,” as rendered by Elliott: the word describes not the appearance, but the material, of the sea: it appeared like a sea of glass—so clear, and so calm) <b>like to caystal</b> (and that not common glass, which among the ancients was, as we see from its remains, cloudy and semi-opaque, but like rock crystal for transparency and beauty, as Victorinus, “clear water, steady, unruffled by the wind.” Compare by way of contrast her that sitteth on the <i>many waters</i>, the multitudinous and turbulent waters, ch. xvii. 1.—In seeking the explanation of this, we must first track the image from its Old Test. earlier usage. There, in Exod. xxiv. 10, we have in the Septuagint version, “<i>And they saw the place where the God of Israel stood: and that which was under His feet was as it were work of sapphire bricks, and as the appearance of the firmament of heaven in its purity.” </i>Compare with this Ezek. i. 22, “<i>And the likeness over the heads of the living beings themselves was as it were a firmament, stretched out over their wings above.</i>” In Job xxvii. 18 also, the sky is said to be “as a molten looking-glass.” If we are to follow these indices, the primary reference will be to the clear ether in which the throne of God is upborne: and the intent of setting this space in front of the throne<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PG-LcKw9bp0psB_YhWqAG7YlUUBUEbIf/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The material and appearance of this pavement of the throne seem chosen to indicate majestic repose and ethereal purity. All kinds of symbolic interpretations, more or less fanciful, have been given.

See below), <b>and round about the throne</b> (i.e. so that in the Apostle’s view they partly hid the throne, partly overlapped the throne, being symmetrically arranged with regard to it, i.e., as the number necessitates, one in the midst of each side), <b>four living beings</b> (the A. V., “<i>beasts</i>,” is the most unfortunate word that could be imagined.

I have therefore preferred <i>living-beings</i>, or, <b>beings</b>, which gives the same idea) <b>full of eyes before and behind</b> (this, from their respective positions, could be seen by St. John; their faces being naturally towards the throne.

[compare Ezek. i, 5—10, x. 20], which are called by the same name of living-creatures, and are similarly described. We may trace however some differences. In Ezekiel’s vision, each living- being has all four faces, Ez. i. 6, whereas here the four belong severally, one to each. Again in Ezekiel’s vision, it is apparently the <i>wheels </i>which are full of eyes, Ezek. i. 18; though in ch. x. 12, it would appear as if the animals also were included. Again, the having <i>six </i>wings apiece is not found in the cherubim of Ezekiel, which have <i>four</i>, Ezek. i. 6,—but belongs to the seraphim described in Isa. vi. 2, to whom also [see above] belongs the ascription of praise here given. So that these are forms compounded out of the most significant particulars of more than one Old Test. vision.<br><br>In enquiring after their symbolic import, we are met by the most remarkable diversity of interpretation. 1) Our earliest Commentator, Victorinus, may serve as the type of those who have understood them to symbolize the Four Evangelists, or rather, <i>Gospels:</i>— “The animal like a <i>lion </i>is the Gospel according to Mark, in which the voice of a lion roaring in the desert is heard, the voice of one crying in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord. Under the figure of a <i>man</i>, Matthew strives to announce to us the generation of Mary from whom Christ received flesh. So while he enumerates from Abraham to David and Joseph, he has spoken as of a man. Therefore his preaching shews the effigy of a <i>man</i>. Luke, while he tells of the priesthood of Zacharias offering a victim for the people, and the angel appearing to him,—on account of the priesthood, and the description of the victim, is represented by an <i>ox</i>. And the Evangelist John, like an <i>eagle</i>, taking wing and hastening up to loftier things, treats of the Word of God.” I have cited this comment at length, to shew on what fanciful and untenable ground it rests. For with perhaps the one exception of the last of the four, not one of the Evangelists has any inner or substantial accordance with the character thus assigned. Consequently these characteristics are found varied, and that in the earliest writer whom the view can be traced, viz. Irenæus, who makes the lion to be the gospel of St. John; the steer that of St. Luke, as above; the man, that of St. Matthew; the eagle, that of St. Mark. So also Andreas. But again Augustine attributes the lion to St. Matthew, the man to St. Mark, the steer to St. Luke, aud the eagle to St. John. These notices may again serve to shew with what uncertainty the whole view is beset. It has nevertheless been adopted by Jerome, Primasius, Bede, and many others of old, and among the moderns by Williams [on the Study of the Gospels, pp. 1—92], Scott [Interpretation of the Apocalypse, p. 132, but making, as Augustine above, the lion, St. Matthew; the man, St. Mark; the ox, St. Luke; and the eagle, St. John], Wordsworth [Lectures on the Apocalypse, p. 116, who, as in his statements on the other details, so here, ascribes unanimity [see below!] to the ancients: “in them <i>the ancient church </i>beheld a figure of the four gospels,” suppressing also the fact of discrepancies in the application to the individual gospels], &c. The principal of the other interpretations prevalent among the ancients and moderns have been: 2) the 4 elements: 3) the 4 cardinal virtues: 4) the 4 faculties and powers of the human soul: 5) Our Lord in the fourfold great events of Redemption: 6) the 4 patriarchal-churches: the lion being Jerusalem, for its constancy ; the ox, Antioch, for its obedience; the man, Alexandria, for its human learning; the eagle, Constantinople, for having produced the men of most elevated contemplation: and Cornelius-a-lapide, who adopts this, interprets the throne of God to be “the see of Rome, in which sits the lion of God:” 7) the 4 great Apostles, Peter, fervent as the <i>lion:</i> James the Lord’s brother, patient as the <i>ox:</i> Matthew, good as the <i>man:</i> Paul, always flying about as the <i>eagle:</i> 8) all the doctors of the church: 9) four orders of churchmen, pastors, deacons, doctors, contemplatives: 10) the 4 representatives of the New Test. church, as the four standards of the tribes Reuben, Judah, Ephraim, and Dan, which are traditionally thus reported [see also Num. ii.], were of the Old Test. church: 11) the 4 virtues of the Apostles, magnanimity, beneficence, equity, wisdom: 12) the 4 principal angels: 13) the angelic, or equal-to-angelic, state of the glorified<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PNtecK10iwT3ZK5gyBd2sh7P-ImonE5A/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

But thus we have no account given of the peculiar symbolism of these living-beings, nor of the part which they perform in the act of praise below. There are many other interpretations and ramifications of interpretation, hardly worth recounting. But the one which above all these seems to me to require our notice is that which is indicated in the rabbinical sentence cited by Schöttgen here: “There are four which hold pre-eminence in this world: man among all animals; the eagle among birds; the ox among cattle; the lion among beasts.” The four cherubic forms are the representatives of animated nature —of God’s sentient creation. In Ezekiel, each form is compounded of the four. Here, the four forms are distinct. There [xxviii. 12], where the prince of Tyrus is compared to one of them, it is called the impression of similitude, and the crown of beauty: in Isaiah vi. where the seraphim, which enter into the composition of these living-beings, ascribe holiness to Jehovah, they cry, “His glory is the fulness of the whole earth.” With this view every thing that follows is in accordance. For when these, and the 24 elders, in vv. 9—11, fall down before the throne, the part which these living-beings bear in the great chorus of praise is sufficiently indicated by the reason which they give for their ascription, viz. <i>for Thou art worthy</i>, <b>because Thou didst create all things</b>, <i>and because of Thy will they were, and were created.</i> The objection brought against this view by Ebrard, viz. that Behemoth, the king of the waters, is not here represented, is mere trifling. He forgets that in the record of creation, the noblest of the creatures sprung from the waters are not fishes, but birds; and that the eagle represents both. It is in strict accordance also with this view, that these living- beings are full of eyes, ever wakeful, ever declaring the glory of God: that they have each six wings, which doubtless are to be taken as in Isa. vi. from which the figure comes—“with twain he covered his face [<i>reverence</i>, in not venturing to look on the divine majesty], and with twain he covered his feet [<i>humility</i>, hiding his own created form from the glory of the Creator], and with twain he did fly [<i>obedience</i>, readiness to perform the divine commands].” This view is taken by the best of the modern Commentators: by Herder, De Wette, Rinck, Hengstenberg, Düsterdieck. Ebrard differs only in this, that he regards them as symbolic not of creation itself, but of the creative power of God. Stern, whose commentary on this whole passage is very able and beautiful, inclines rather to take them as representing the power of divine grace within the church of God: but in his usual interpretation treats them as “the whole creative-life of nature.” See also my Hulsean Lectures for 1841, vol. i.

And thus the reason follows): <b>because Thou didst create all things</b> (“this universal whole,” the universe), <b>and on account of Thy will</b> (i.e., beemise Thou didst will it: <i>“for thy pleasure,”</i> of the A.

A remarkable reading of some of our MSS. is worth notice: “by reason of Thy will they <b>were not</b>, and were created?” i.e., “they were created out of nothing”), <b>and were created</b> (they both had their being—and received it from Thee by a definite act of Thine).<h2><u><b>CH.

See also Jer. xxxvi. 2, 23; Zech. v. 2: and below) <b>written within and behind</b> (such scrolls, written not only, as commonly, on the inner side, but also on the outer, which, to one reading the inner, was <i>behind </i>[see below], are mentioned by Pliny, Lucian, Juvenal, and Martial. This writing, within and without, so that the whole roll was full, seems to betoken the <i>completeness </i>of the contents as containing the divine counsels: there was no room for addition to that which was therein written. This would be of itself a sufficient reason for the <i>fulness </i>of the scroll. To sce two <i>divisions of written matter</i> indicated, by the writing within, and by that on the back, correspondent to one another, seems hardly warranted by the text), <b>fast-sealed with seven seals </b>(not, consisting of seven writings, each sealed with one seal, as various Commentators hold: but one book, fastened with seven seals, which were visible to the Apostle. Various ingenious methods have been imagined, by which the opening of each of these seals may have loosened a corresponding portion of the roll. But they all proceed on the assumption that the roll in the vision was <i>unfolded</i>, which is nowhere to be gathered from the text. Nor have we any right to say that the separate visions which follow the opening of each seal are identical with <i>separate portions</i> of writing on the roll. These visions are merely symbolic representations of the progress of God’s manifestation of the purpose of His will; but no portion of the roll is actually unfolded, nor is any thing read out of the book. Not its contents, but the gradual stops of access to it, are represented by these visions. What is <i>in </i>that book, shall not be known, until there shall be known to the powers and authorities in the heavenly places, by the Church, the manifold wisdom of God, Eph. iii. 10: till those material events, which marked the gradual opening of the sum of God’s purposes, are all past, and the roll is contemplated in its completeness by the spirits of the glorified hereafter. This <i>completeness </i>is here set forth to us again by the mystic number <i>seven.</i> There are some excellent remarks on the entire distinctness <i>of the opening of the seals,</i> and the <i>reading of the book</i>, in Cornelius-a-lapide: “For nothing in the book would be read, except after the opening of all seven seals; for when all were opened, then at length the book could be opened and read, not before.” So also Ribera: “Those calamities which were involved in the seals, were all to come, before the things which were written in the book appeared and were known.”<br><br>Mr. Elliott, in his work “Apocalypsis Alfordiana,” specially directed against my commentary on this book, treats this view with all the scorn which is unfortunately so characteristic of him: calling it absurd, unscriptural, &c. He has not produced a word of proof, or even illustrative corroboration, of his own view, that the opening of each seal corresponds to the unrolling of a certain portion of the scroll: but has contented himself with re-asserting it in the strongest language, and pouring contempt on those who hold the other view. I grieve to say, that this is so often the case throughout his above-mentioned work, as to render it impossible for me, in many places, to meet his objections in argument. One who distrusts his own as well as all other explanations, and believes that much of this mysterious book is as yet unfathomed, is no match for one who hesitates not on every occasion to shew his confidence that he is in the right, and all who differ from him are wrong.<br><br>An enquiry here arises,<i> What is represented by this Book?</i> Opinions have been very various. 1) Some of our earliest Commentators understood by it the Old Testament: or the Old and New conjoined. It will appear from the extracts given in my Greek Test., that the opening of the seals was very generally by the earlier fathers and interpreters taken to mean, the fulfilment, and consequent bringing to light, of Old Test. prophecy by the events of Redemption as accomplished in the Person of our Lord. But, if so, then this view cannot consist with what follows in the Apocalypse. For manifestly the opening of the seals, as notified by the symbolic visions belonging to each, does not relate to things past, but to things which were yet future when this book was written. Nor can this apparent consensus of the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kconUM7YB3YuuKA_5tcjOAoq7VJt27-e/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true
" target="_blank">DOCX LINK: Volume 2, Part 2, Page 636:</a></h3><br>early expositors be cited, as it has been e.g. by Dr. Adams, im support of any <i>other </i>view than theirs, in which this Book shall still represent the Old Test. Such for example is that of Dr. Adams himself, who regards the opening of the scaled Book as symbolizing a future republication of the genuine text of the Old Test., by which the Jewish people is to be converted. The untenableness of this view appears at once, if only from [so to speak] its touching the apocalyptic course of visions at this point only, and finding no justification or expansion in any of the symbolic visions accompanying the opening of the seals. 2) Some have held the Book to be <i>Christ Himself</i>. But for the same reasons as above, neither can this be maintained. 3) Wetstein takes it to be “the writing of divorcement written hy God against the Jewish nation:” which for the same reason falls to the ground. 4) Schöttgen, the sentence pronounced by the Judge and His assessors against the enemies of the Church: and similarly, in the main, Hengstenberg : but this view, though strongly defended hy Hengstenberg, is not borne out by the contents of these chapters. 5) Aleasar holds it to be that part of the Apocalypse which treats of the opening of the seven seals [ch. vi.— xi.]: and nearly so Hengstenberg also, except that he allows only from vi. 1 to viii. 1 for this portion. But both are obviously wrong, seeing that the opening of the seventh seal evolves a series of symbolic actions which only ends with the book itself. So that this comes to 6) the Book being the Apocalypse itself: so Cornelius-a-lapide, seeing in the seven seals that part relating to their opening, and after that regarding the subsequent visions concerning Antichrist and the end of the world, as the <i>contents of the book itself.</i> But he seems, in concluding his paragraph, to resolve this view into the wider one, 7) that the Book represents “the deliberation and decision of the Divine Providence, wherein God determined with Himself to do or permit, &c.” This is very nearly that of Arethas, Lyra, Vitringa, Mede, Ewald, De Wette, Stern, Düsterdieck, and others, And this is, in the main, my own view. We may observe, that it is in fact but a limitation of this meaning, when many understand the Book to contain the prophetic fortunes of the Church of Christ: but also that it is a limitation which has arisen from the mistake noticed above, of confounding the opening of the seals with the reading of the contents of the book. Those successive openings, or if we will, the fortunes and periods of the Church and world, are but so many preparations for that final state of perfection in which the Lamb shall reveal to the Church the contents of the Book itself).<h2><u><b>2.]</u></h2> And I saw a strong angel</b> (the epithet <b>strong </b>is by no means superfluous, but corresponds to the <i>loud voice</i> below, which, as appears by what followed, penetrated heaven and earth, and Hadés.

There was no weakness of faith, as Hengstenberg fancies: indeed such a supposition is entirely out of place here: St. John is in this book the simple <i>recipient </i>of the Apocalypse; for <i>that </i>he is summoned to the heavenly scene, for <i>that </i>he is waiting in humility: but that now seems to be precluded, and his tears burst forth in the earnestness of disappointed desire after the fulfilment of the promise.

In the division of the two employments, the most of prayer falls to the lot of the church in trial, and the most of praise to the church in glory: and this is perhaps the reason why, while they have harps on which they themselves play, they only offer or present the vials of incense. De Wette remarks, that the Writer of the Apocalypse seems not to know any thing of the intercessory office of Christ. But that office is prominent through this whole seene.

VI.1—VIII 1.]</u></h1></b> THE OPENING OF THE SEVEN SEALS. As preliminary to the exposition of this section, I may observe that it is of the first importance to bear in mind, that the openings of these seals correspond to the various arrangements of God’s Providence by which the way is prepared for the final opening of the closed book of His purposes to His glorified Church, That opening shall not fully and freely be made, till His people will know even as they are known. And that will not be, till they are fully gathered in to His heavenly garner. This book the Lamb opens, containing as it does matters which “no one knoweth, neither the angels which are in heaven, nor even the Son,” first by the acts and procedures of His establishment of His reign over the earth, and then finally by His great second coming, the necessary condition of His elect being gathered out of the four winds into His glory. When these preparations for His coming have taken place, and that coming itself has passed, and the elect are gathered into glory, then will be the time when the last hindrance to our perfect knowledge will be removed, and the book of God’s eternal purposes will lie open—the theme of eternity’s praise.<br><br>I may add that. for the sake of perspicuity, I shall mainly follow, in these notes, the track of that interpretation which seems to me to be required; noticing only differences in those of other Commentators where absolutely necessary.<h2><u><b>1—8.]</u></h2></b> <i>The opening of the first four seals</i>, marked by the ministration of the four living-beings.<h2><u><b>1.]</u></h2></b> <b>And I saw when the Lamb opened one from among the seven seals, and I heard one from among the four living-beings saying, as the voice of thunder</b> (which is to be taken not as peculiarly belonging to this first as resembling a lion, but as belonging to all alike, and accounted for by their mysterious and exalted nature: compare ch. i. 10, x. 3), <b>Come </b>(to whom, and with what meaning is this spoken?.

But whither was he to come? Separated as he was by the glassy sea from the throne, was he to cross it? Compare the place where the Seer is to come and take the little book [ch. x. 8], and see how different is the whole form of expression. In interpreting so unusual a term of address, surely we should rather begin by enquiring whether we have not the key to it in the book itself. And in this enquiry, are we justified in leaving ont. of consideration such a verse as ch. xxii.17, <i>“The Spirit and the Bride say </i><b>Come </b>[the same word, and in the same number and Person) <i>and let him that hear eth say</i> <b>Come</b>,” and the following “<i>Amen</i>, <b>Come</b>, <i>Lord Jesus</i>,” xxii. 22? This seems to shew, in my mind, beyond a doubt, what, in the mind of the Seer, this remarkable and insulated exclamation imported. It a cry addressed, not to himself, but to the Lord Jesus: and as each of these four first seals is accompanied by a similar cry from one of the four living-beings, I see represented in this fourfold <b>Come </b>the groaning and travailing together of creation for the manifestation of the sons of God, expressed in each case in a prayer for Christ’s coming: and in the things revealed when the seals are opened, His fourfold preparation for His coming on earth. Then at the opening of the fifth seal the longing of the martyred saints for the same great consummation is expressed, and at that of the sixth it actually arrives). <b>And I saw, and behold a white horse, and he that sat on him having a bow; and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering, and in order that he may conquer </b>(in the first place, the figure of the horses and their riders at once brings to mind the similar vision in Zechariah, i. 7–11, vi. 1–8, where the men on the horses are they whom the Lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the whole earth. In Zech. i. as here, that part of the vision is followed, ver. 12, by the cry of the <i>“How long?”</i> Here the horses and their riders are the various aspects of the divine dispensations which should come upon the earth preparatory to the great day of the Lord’s coming. As regards this first, the whole imagery speaks of <i>victory</i>. The horses of the Roman commanders in their triumphs were white. The <i>bow </i>serves to identify the imagery here with that in Habakkuk iii. 9, where God goes forth for the salvation of His people : see also Isa. xli. 2; Zech. ix. 13: and even more strikingly with that in Ps. xlv. 4, 5, “In thy majesty ride prosperously, because of truth and meekness and righteousness: and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king’s enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.” It is hardly possible that one whose mind was full of such imagery, should have had any other meaning in his thoughts than that to which these prophecies point. The <i>crown </i>finds its parallel in the vision of Zech. vi., where, ver. 11, it is said, “Take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest.” The <i>going forth conquering and in order to conquer</i> can only, it seems to me, point to one interpretation. The <i>conquering </i>might be said of any victorious earthly power whose victories should endure for the time then present, and after wards pass away: but the <i>in order that he may conquer</i> can only be said of a power whose victories should last for ever. Final and permanent victory then is here imported. Victory, we may safely say, on the part of that kingdom against which the gates of hell shall not prevail: whose fortunes and whose trials are the great subject of this revelation. Such is the first vision, the opening of the first seal in the mystery of the divine purposes: <i>victory for God’s church and people:</i> the great key-note, so to speak, of all the apocalyptic harmonies. And notice, that in this interpretation, there is no lack of correspondence with the three visions which follow.<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NX-j85V7pXDMUFeXS6dOkYpVihTfPgl/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Nor is this analogy disturbed, when we come to enquire, <i>who is the rider</i> on this white horse. We must not, in reply, on the one hand, too hastily introduce the Person of our Lord Himself, or on the other, be startled at the objection that we shall be paralleling Him, or one closely resembling Him, with the far different forms which follow. Doubtless, the resemblance to the rider in ch. xix. 11 ff. is very close, and is intended to be very close. The difference however is considerable. There, He is set forth as <i>present </i>in His triumph, followed by the hosts of heaven : here, He is working, in bodily absence, and the rider is not Himself, but only a symbol of His victorious power, the embodiment of His advancing kingdom as regards that side of its progress where it breaks down earthly power, and makes the kingdom of the world to be the kingdom of our Lord and His Christ. Further it would not be wise, nor indeed according to the analogy of these visions, to specify. In all cases but the last, these riders are left in the vagueness of their symbolic offices. If we attempt in this ease to specify further, e. g. as Victorinus, “The white horse is the word of preaching with the aid of the Holy Spirit sent forth into the world; for the Lord saith, This gospel shall he preached through all the world, for a testimony before the nations, and then shall the end come,”— while we are sure that we are thus far right, we are but partially right: we do not cover the extent of the symbol, seeing that there are other aspects and instruments of victory of the kingdom of Christ, besides the preaching of the Word. The same might be said of any other of the partial interpretations which have been given by those who have taken this view. And it was taken, with divergences of separate detail, by all expositors from the earliest times down to the year 1500).<h2><u><b>3, 4.]</u></h2></b> <b>And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living-being saying, Come</b> (see above on ver. 1).<b> And there came forth another horse, red </b>(the colour of blood. The colour of the horse in each case has reference to the employment of the rider), <b>and to him that sat upon him it was given to take away peace</b> (not “the peace left by the former seal,” for 1) the former seal neither implies nor leaves such peace, and 2) these four seals are strictly correlative, not consecutive on one another; but, peace <i>in its entirety</i>) <b>out of the earth</b> (generally, as ever: not, Judæa, nor the Roman empire, nor any special portion merely) <b>and that they</b> (men: the inhabitants of the earth) <b>shall kill</b> (so literally: not only importing the result of purpose, but including also matter of fact, “that they may... which they also shall”)<b> one another: and there was given to him a great sword</b> (the key to the interpretation of this seal is to be found in Matt. x. 34 and parallels: <i>“Think not that I came to send peace upon the earth; I came not to send peace, but </i><b>a sword</b>.” It represents to us the taking away of peace from the earth, the slaying one another, the reign of the sword, as one of the destined concomitants of the growing and conquering power of Christ, and one of the world-long and world-wide preparations for His coming. Observe, all <i>limitations </i>of this meaning are wrong; whether to the persecutions of the Christians, or to any period of time, ancient or modern, The above was the most ancient interpretation; e. g. we have in Victorinus, “The red horse, and he that sat upon him having a sword, are future wars, as we read in the gospel, for nation shall rise against nation, &c.” Matt. xxiv. 7).<h2><u><b>5, 6.]</u></h2> And when he opened the third</b><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1l7ZGWeDRNfxx9kM-Ci_KYEQteOST69/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The denarius was the ordinary soldier’s pay for a day in the time of Tiberius [see note on Matt. xx. 2], and lias been usually and not unfairly assumed to be twice mentioned here as representing a day’s wages. The chœnix appears in like manner to be taken for a day’s provision: for so it is used in several of the numerous places cited by the Commentators. Herodotus, in estimating the amount of food consumed by the army of Xerxes, assumes this: “I find by calculation,” he says, “supposing that each consumed a chœnix a day and no more....” and similarly Thucydides, speaking of allowance made to the Lacedæmonians in Sphacteria while negotiations were going on. A proverb also is mentioned, “Don’t sit upon a chœnix,” meaning, “don’t confine your provision to the current day, a chœnix being an allowance for the day.” Nothing can be more decisive than such proverbial usage. The tendency of the voice is then to check or limit the agency of the rider on the black horse, and to provide that, notwithstanding his errand of famine, sustenance shall not utterly fail. With regard to the three chœnixes of barley, the cheaper and less profitable grain, it seems to have been rightly interpreted as taking in the other case, of the workman who, out of his denarius a day, has to maintain not himself only, but his family also, and cannot consequently afford the dearer wheaten bread); <b>and the oil and the wine do not thou injure</b> (not, “do thou not commit injustice in the matter of the oil and the wine.” The usage of this book should have prevented such an interpretation: for the verb here used with the accusative of the material object hurt or injured is the constant habit of our Writer: and in no case do we find the other construction used by him, or indeed by any other writer to my knowledge. Rinck gives another meaning, equally untenable, “<i>waste</i> not the oil and the wine,” seeing they are so costly.<br><br>As regards the meaning, the spirit of the saying is as explained above: the rider on the black horse, symbolizing Famine, is limited in his desolating action by the command given, that enough is to be reserved for sustenance.

It has not yet happened: but the tribes of the earth are troubled at its immediate approach, and those terrible signs with which all Scripture ushers it in, have taken place. We are now then arrived at the time described in ‘Matt. xxiv. 80: the coming itself of the Son of man being for a while kept in the background, as hereafter to be resumed. He is seen as it were coming: but before the vengeance is fully accomplished, the elect of God then living on the earth must be gathered, as Matt. xxiv. 31, out of the four winds of heaven, from among the inhabitants of the earth. To this ingathering the sealing in our text is the necessary preliminary. ‘The correspondence between. the series of prophecies holds even in the minutest particulars, and where they do not correspond, their very differences are full of instruction.

When the strain is again taken up, the ease and reference are different.<br><br>‘The questions now arise, 1) who are these that are sealed? and 2) what is the intent of their being sealed ? 1) Those who have followed the preceding course of interpretation will have no difficulty in anticipating the reply. ‘They are, primarily, those elect of God who shall be living upon earth at the time here indicated, viz. that of the coming of the Lord: those indicated in Matt. xxiv. 31, above cited.

As such, they are not <i>identical with</i>, but are <i>included in</i>, the great multitude which no man ean number of ver. 9 ff.

No one that I am aware of has taken it literally, and supposed that just this particular number and no more is imported. The import for us is, that the Lord knoweth and sealeth His own: that the fulness of their number shall be accomplished and not one shall fail: and, from what follows, that the least as well as the greatest of the portions of his Church shall furnish its quota to this blessed company: see more below) <b>from every tribe</b> (i.e. from the sum of the tribes; from every tribe, all being taken together. ‘This is evident from what follows) <b>of the sons of Israel</b> (this has been variously under- stood. By many, and even by the most recent Commentator, Dusterdieek, these sealed ones are taken to represent Jewish believers: the chosen out of the actual children of Israel. I need hardly say that such an interpretation seems to me to be quite inconsistent with the usage of this book. Our rule in such cases must be, to interpret a term, where it. may possibly be ambiguous, by the use of the same tern we can discover any, in a place or places where it is clear and unimistakeable. Now in the description of the heavenly Jerusalem, ch. xxi. 9 f., we have the names <i>of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel </i>inscribed on its twelve gates.

[For observe that such an inference could not be escaped by the fact of the names of the twelve Apostles being inscribed on its foundations: those being individual names, the others collective.] It seems certain, by this expression being again used there in the same words, that the Apostle must here, as there, have intended Israel to be taken not as the Jewish nation, but as the Israel of God. Again, we have a striking indication furnished in ch. iii. 12, who these children of Israel are :—“ <i>He that overcometh</i>, .... <b>I will write upon him</b><i> the name of my God, and</i> the name <b>of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem</b>, <i>which cometh down out of heaven from my God,—and my new name</i>.” These words serve to bind together the sealing here, and the vision of the new Jerusalem in ch. xxi. Nor is it any valid objection to this view that the persons calling themselves Jews in ch. ii. 9, iii. 9, have been taken to be actual Jews, There is a wide difference in the circumstances there, as there is also in the appellation itself): <b>out of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed, &c. &c</b>.—The points to be noticed in this enumeration are, 1) That with the exception of Judah being placed first, the order of the tribes does not seem to follow any assignable principle. It may indeed be not without reason, that Reuben, the eldest, next follows Judah, and Benjamin the youngest is placed last, with Joseph his own brother: but beyond this, all is uncertainty: as any one will find, who attempts to apply to the order any imaginable rule of arrangement, So far has been generally confessed.“ No order is kept, because all are equal in Christ,” says Grotius. 2) That the tribe of Dan is omitted. This is accounted for by the fathers and ancient interpreters, from thé idea [founded on Gen, xlix. 17] that antichrist was to arise from this tribe: by most Commentators, from the fact, that this tribe was the first to fall into idolatry, see Judg. xvili.: by others, from the fact that this tribe had been long ago as good as extinct. Grotius quotes for this a Jewish tradition, Accordingly we find in 1 Chron. iv. ff. where all Israel are reckoned by genealogies, that this tribe is omitted altogether. ‘This latter seems the more probable account here, seeing that in order to the number 12 being kept, some one of the smaller tribes must be omitted. In Dent. xxxiii., Simeon is omitted. 38) That instead of Ephraim, <i>Joseph</i> is mentioned. We have a somewhat similar instance in ‘Numb. 11, with this difference, that there it is “ of the tribe of Joseph, namely of the tribe of Manasseh.” The substitution here has been accounted for by the “untheocratie” recollections connected with the name Ephraim. But this may well be questioned. In the prophecy of Hosea, where the name so frequently occurs, it designates Israel repentant, as well as Israel backsliding ; compare especially ch. xiv. 4—8, the recollection of which would admirably fit the spirit of this present passage. I should rather pose that some practice had arisen which the Apostle adopts, of calling the tribe of Ephraim by this name. 4) That the tribe of Levi is included among the rest, hardly appears to depend on the reason assigned by Bengel and others, that the Levitical ceremonies being now at an end, all are alike priests and have access to God: for in some Old Test. catalogues. even where territorial division is in question, Levi is not omitted : the cities of the priests being mentioned under the head of this tribe. See 1 Chron, vi.<br><br>It yet remains to enquire, before passing on to the second vision in this episode, what is the import and intent of the sealing here mentioned. It has been the general view, that it was to exempt those sealed from the judgments which were to come on the unbelieving. And it can hardly be denied, that this view receives strong support from Scripture analogy; e.g. that of Exod. xii. and Ezek. ix., especially the latter, where the exempted ones are marked, as here, on their foreheads. It is borne out by our eh. ix. 4, where these sealed ones are by implication exempted from the plague of the locusts from the pit. It is again hardly possible to weigh fairly the langnage used in this place itself, without coming to the same conclusion.

For what imaginable reason could such a prohibition be uttered, unless those who were to be sealed were to he marked out for some purpose connected with that work? And for what purpose could they be thus marked out, if not. for exemption? ‘The objection brought against s view by Dusterdieck, that so far from being exempt from trials, the saints in ry have come out of great tribulation, is grounded on the mistake of not distinguishing between the trials of the people of God and the judgments on the unbelieving world. In the latter, the saints have no part, as neither had the children of Israel in the plagues of Egypt. And indeed the very symbolism here used, in which the elect are pointed out under the names of the 12 tribes, serves to remind us of this ancient exemption. At the same time, exemption from the coming plagues is not the only object of the sealing. It serves a positive as well as a negative purpose, It appropriates to God those upon whom it has passed. For the seal contains His own Name, see ch, iii, 12, xiv. 1. And thus they are not only gathered out of the world, but declared to be ready to be gathered into the city of God. And thus the way is prepared for the next vision in the episode.<h2><u><b>9—17.</b>]</u></h2> THE GREAT MULTITUDE oF THE REDEEMED IN HEAVEN. The opening of the sixth seal introduced the coming of the Lord. The first vision of the episode revealed the gathering together of the elect from the four winds. But before the seventh and <i>last</i> seal can be opened, and the book of God’s purposes be unrolled, not only must all things on this earth be accomplished, but the whole multitude of the redeemed must be gathered in to the joy of their Lord. ‘Then, and not till then, shall we know even as we are known, and read the mystery of God’s ways without hindrance.

See more below). <b>And it was given to him to give breath</b> (or, spirit; by inference, life) <b>to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should even speak, and should cause that as many as do not worship the image of the beast should be slain. </b>The Seer is now describing facts which history substantiates to us in their literal fulfilment. ‘The image of Cæsar was every where that which men were made to worship: it was before this that the Christian martyrs were brought to the test, and put to death if they refused the act of adoration. ‘The words of Pliny’s letter to Trajan are express on the point: “When they called on the gods at my dictation, and offered incense and wine to thine image (which for this purpose I had ordered to be brought with those of the gods), and besides cursed Christ, which it is said that no true Christian can be compelled to do, I thought fit to dismiss them.” Above he had said, “those who persevered [in their Christianity] I ordered to be led to execution.” And if it be said as an objection to this, that it is not an image of the Emperor but of the beast itself which is spoken of, the answer is very simple, that as the Evangelist himself, in ch. xvii. 11, does not hesitate to identify one of the <i>seven kings</i> with the beast itself, so we may fairly assume that the image of the beast for the time being would be the image of the reigning Emperor. It is not so easy to assign a meaning to the giving <i>life and speech</i> to the image of the beast. Victorinus gives a curious explanation: “he shall also cause that a golden image to Antichrist shall be erected in the temple at Jerusalem, and a fallen angel shall enter and thence utter voices and give oracles.” The allusion probably is to some lying wonders permitted to the Pagan priests to try the faith of God’s people. We cannot help, as we read, thinking of the moving images, and winking and speaking pictures, so often employed for purposes of imposture by their far less excusable Papal successors. <b>And he</b> (i. e. the <i>second beast</i>, more naturally than <i>the</i><br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jZwRhBjsefQA6tmWyq7aVVwB_OWQL5Lm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

We read in 3 Macc. ii, 29, of Ptolemy Philopater, that he ordered the Jews in Alexandria to be forcibly enrolled, and when enrolled, to be marked with a red-hot brand on their body, with the sign of Bacchus the Ivy-wearer. And Philo mentions idolaters who confessed their idolatry by branding themselves with indelible marks) <b>on their right hand </b>(on which part soldiers were branded), <b>or upon their forehead</b> (i.e. in some conspicuous part of the body, that all may see it: or as Augustine says, “in the forehead for profession : in the hand for operation”), <b>and that no one should be able to buy or to sell, except he who has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name </b>(either in the name stamped in letters, or in the number of the name thus stamped, i.e. the number which those letters make when added together according to their numerical value. ‘The practice of thus calculating the numerical value of the letters in names was widely prevalent: see the instances collected by Mr. Elliott, vol. iii. pp. 220 ff. : and more below. ‘This particular in the prophetic description seems to point to the commercial and spiritual interdiets which have, both by Pagan and by Papal persecutors, been laid on non-conformity : from even before the interdict of Diocletian, through those of the middle ages [both which ran in nearly these very terms], down to the last remaining civil disabilities imposed on non-conformity in modern Papal or Protestant countries. For these last have their share in the enormities of the first and second beasts, in as far as they adopt or continue their practices. With regard to the circumstance of the imposition of the mark, I conceive that with the latitude here given, viz., that it may be the name or the number, and having regard to the analogy of the mark inscribed on the saints (ch. xiii, 1: compare ch. vii. 1 ff.], we need not be anxious to find other than a general and figurative interpretation. As it is clear that in the case of the servants of God no actual visible mark is intended, so it may well be inferred here that the mark signifies rather conformity and addiction to the behests of the beast, than any actual stigma impressed. Certainly we fail to recognize any adequate exposition of such stigma in the sign of the Cross as propounded by Mr. Elliott [iii, 236], or in the monogram on the labarum as succeeded by the Papal cross-keys, of Dr. Wordsworth [Apocalypse, Appendix G]). <b>Here is wisdom </b>(these words serve to direct attention to the challenge which follows: see ver. 10 and ch. xiv. 12, where here is similarly used): <b>let him who hath understanding calculate the number of the beast</b> (the terms of the challenge serve at once to shew that the feat proposed is possible, and that it is difficult.

And that one is the word mentioned, though not adopted, by Irenaus, lateinos, the Greek letters of which, by their numerical power, make up the required number. This name describes the common character of the rulers of the former Pagan Roman Empire, for, says Ireneus, “<i>they are Latins who now rule</i>,” and, which Irenwus could not foresee, unites under itself the character of the latter Papal Roman Empire also, as revived and kept up by the agency of its false prophet the priesthood. The Latin Empire, the Latin Church, Latin Christianity, have ever been its commonly current appellations : its language, civil and ecclesiastical, has ever been Latin : its public services, in defiance of the most obvious requisite for public worship, have ever been throughout the world conducted in Latin: there is no one word which could so completely describe its character, and at the same time unite the ancient and modern attributes of the two beasts, as this, Short of saying absolutely that this <i>was</i> the word in St. John’s mind, I have the strongest persuasion that no other can be found approaching so near to a complete solution, See however the remarks on this subject in the Introduc- tion, § v. par. 32, where I have after all thought it best to leave the matter in doubt).<h2><u><b>CH.

This is not entirely another vision, but an introduction of a new element, one of comfort. and joy, upon the scene of the last. And thus it must be viewed: with reference to the persecution by the beast which is alluded to in its course, vv. 9 ff. It is also anticipatory, first containing reference to the mystic’ Babylon, hereafter to become the subject of prophecy in detail; and to the consummation of punishment, and reward, also to be treated in detail hereafter. It is <i>general</i> in its character, reaching forward close to the time of the end, treating compendiously of the torment of the apostates and the blessedness of the holy dead, and leading, by its concluding section, which treats of the harvest and the vintage of the earth, to the vision of the seven last vials, now immediately to follow. It naturally divides itself into three sections: of which the first is, <h2><u><b>1—5</b>.]</u></h2> <i>The Lamb on Mount Sion, and His hundred and forty-four thousand</i>. <b>And I saw, and behold the Lamb </b>(viz, the same which before was seen in the midst of the throne, ch. v.6 al.) <b>standing upon the mount Sion</b> (as in ch. xi., the holy city is introduced as the seat of God’s true church and worship, so by a similar figure [not the same, for thus Mount Sion would be outside the temple proper, and given to the Gentiles] the holy mountain Sion is now chosen for the site of the display of God’s chosen ones with Christ, the Son of David, whose city Zion was), <b>and with Him an hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father </b>(observe the tacit assumption that all understand Who is imported by the Lamb) <b>written on their foreheads</b> (first observe the contrast: the nations of the earth, constrained to receive the mark of the beast on their forehead and hand, and the Lambs elect, marked with His name and that of His Father.

The presumption certainly is that the same number occurring here, representing as there the elect and first-fruits of the church, here as there also inscribed on their foreheads with the seal of God in the one case, and His Name in the other, must be descriptive of the same body of persons. And this view, if acquiesced in here, will reflect back considerable light on that former vision of the sealing in ch. vii, ‘Those, as these, will represent the first-fruits or choice ones among God’s people, as indeed we have treated them in this commentary, and not the totality of those who shall form the great multitude which no man can number, These, as those, are taken to represent the people of God: their introduction serves to place before us the church on the holy hill of Zion, where God has placed His King, as an introduction to the description of her agency in preaching the everlasting Gospel, and her faithfulness amidst persecutions). <b>And I heard a voice out of heaven, as a voice of many waters</b> (reff.), <b>and as a voice of great thunder</b> (ch. vi. 1): <b>and the voice which I heard [was] as of harpers harping with their harps. And they sing [as it were] a new song </b>(i.e. they sing what sounded like a melody unheard before. ‘The subject to <b>they sing </b>is of course not the 144,000, but the heavenly harpers. On the matter of their song, see below) <b>before the throne, and before the four living-beings, and the elders</b> (the whole heavenly symbolism remaining as before, while the visions regarding God’s temple and Mount Zion and the holy city are going forward. I would call the attention of the reader to the fact, essential to the right understanding of the vision, that the harpers and the song are in <i>heaven</i>, the 144,000 on <i>earth</i>): <b>and no one was able to learn the song</b> (to apprehend its melody and meaning, so as to accompany it and bear a part in the chorus) <b>except the hundred and forty-four thousand, who were purchased</b> (see ver. 4, and 1 Cor. vi. 20; ch. v. 9) <b>from the earth</b> (the song has regard to matters of trial and triumph, of deep joy and heavenly purity of heart, which none other among men but these pure and holy ones are capable of apprehending, The sweetest and most skilful harmonies convey no pleasure to, nor are they appreciated by an uneducated ear: whereas the experienced musician finds in every chord the most exquisite enjoyment. The unskilled ear, even though naturally distinctive of musical sounds, could not learn nor reproduce them: but both these can be done by those who have ears to hear them. Even so this heavenly song speaks only to the virgin heart, and can be learnt only by those who accompany the Lamb whithersoever He goeth). <b>These are they who were not</b> (the past tense shews that their course is ended and looked back on as a thing past: and serves to confute all interpretations which regard them as representing saints while in the midst of their earthly conflict and trial)<b> defiled with women</b> (see below); <b>for they are</b> (always were and have kept themselves till the time present) <b>virgins</b> (there are two ways<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R7OkUCeF-q2XiXPgU-CH3NeALyTJM9sF/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

Either they may be figurative, merely implying that these pure ones lived in all chastity, whether in single or in married life, and incurred no pollution [2 Cor. xi 2]: or they may be meant literally, that these purest ones had lived in that state of which St. Paul says, 1 Cor. vii. 1, <i>it is good for a man</i>. And as between these two meanings I conceive that the emphatic position of the words <b>with women</b> in the original goes some way to decide. It is not the fact of impurity in allowed intercourse, but the fact of commerce with women that is put forward. I would therefore believe that in the description of these who are the first-fruits from the earth, the feature of virginity is to be taken in its literal meaning. Nor need any difficulty be found in this. It is on all hands granted that he who is married in the Lord enters into holy relations of which the single have no experience, and goes through blessed and elevating degrees of self-sacrifice, and loving allowance, and preferring others before himself, And as every step of grace assured is a step of glory secured, there is no doubt that the holy married servants of God shall have a peculiar entrance into the fulness of that future Kingdom’s employ, which will not be the lot of the single: seeing that in this matter also, the childhood of this state will be the father of the manhood of that one. But neither on the other hand can it be denied that the state of holy virginity has also its peculiar blessings and exemptions. Of these, the Apostle himself speaks of that absence of distraction from the Lord's work, which is apt to beset the married, busy as they are with the cares of a household and with pleasing one another. And another and primary blessing is, that in them that fountain of carnal desire has never been opened, which is so apt to be a channel for unholy thoughts and an access for the tempter. ‘The virgins may thus have missed the victory over the lusts of the flesh : but they have also in great part escaped the conflict. Theirs is not the triumph of the toil-worn and stained soldier, but the calm and the unspottedness of those who have kept from the strife. We are perhaps more like that which the Lord intended us to be: but they are more like the Lord Himself. And if He is to have round Him a peculiar and closer band, standing with Him on Mount Sion, none will surely grudge this place to those who were not defiled with women. Among these will be not only those who have lived and served Him in holy virginity, but also the dear children whom He has claimed from us for Himself, the youths and maidens who were gathered to His side before the strife began: before their tongues had learned the language of social falsehood, or their good names been tarnished with the breath of inevitable calumny. There is one meaning which these words will not bear, and which it is surprising that any Commentator should ever have attached to them: viz. that <b>with women</b> refers to the woman mentioned below, ch. xvii. So Dr. Wordsworth, p. 284: “They have not been defiled with women, What women ? It may be asked. If we proceed, we read of the woman seated on the Beast, and of the harlotry of the woman, with whom the Kings of the earth commit fornication. And soon we see her displayed in all her meretricious splendour. There then is the reply.” But the whole context here, as well as the language used, is against it: the following words, <b>for they are virgins</b>, carrying its decisive condemnation). <b>These [are] they that follow the Lamb wheresoever he goeth </b>(the description has very commonly been taken as applying to the entire obedience of the elect, following their Lord to prison and to death, and wherever He may call them: but this exposition is surely out of place here, where not their life of conflict, but their state of glory is described, The words are used of special privilege of nearness to the Person of the Lamb in glory). <b>‘These were purchased from men as a first-fruit to God and to the Lamb</b> (all have been thus purchased: but these specially, as and for the purpose of being a first-fruit.

From the almost universal custom of mixing wine with water, the common term for preparing wine, putting it into the cup came to be <i>to mingle</i>. Hence the apparent contradiction in terms here [and in the Psalm below]. The figure of the cup of the Lord’s wrath is found in Ps. lxxiv. 8, in the Septuagint version, “<i>In the hand of the Lord is a cup, full of the mixture of pure wine... all the sinners of the earth shall drink it</i>,” from which this is evidently taken) <b>in the enp of His anger, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the [holy] angels and in the presence of the Lamb</b> (seo ch. xx. 10, and Isa. in the reff., from which the: imagery comes, ‘The meaning is as in Luke xvi 23 ff, that the torments are visible to the angels and the Lamb): <b>and the smoke of their torment goeth up to ages of ages </b>(see Isa. in the reff., and Gen. xviii. 28, which doubtless is the fountain-head: also ch. xix. 3): <b>and they have not rest (from torment) day and night who worship the beast and his image; and whoever</b> (from speaking collectively the solemn declaration becomes even more solemn by individualizing) <b>receives the mark of his name, Here</b> (viz. in the inference to be drawn from the certainty of everlasting torment to all who worship the beast or receive his mark :<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17KKWmYLSI_wKgX2I6HflJVbYtR3Uebfm/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The command, <b>write</b>, would rather point to the angel who reveals the visions to the Evangelist, ch.i.1, and compare ch. iv. 4), <b>saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from henceforth </b>(the connexion is not difficult. The mention of the endurance of the saints brings with it the certainty of persecution unto death. ‘The present proclamation declares the blessedness of all who die not only in persecution, but in any manner, in the Lord, in the faith and obedience of Christ And the special command to write this, conveys special comfort to those in all ages of the church who should read it. But it is not so easy to assign a fit meaning to <b>from henceforth</b>. Being thus joined with the former sentence, it must express some reason why this blessedness is to be more completely realized from this time when it is proclaimed, than it was before. Now this reason will quickly appear, if we consider the particular time, in connexion with which the proclamation is made. The harvest of the earth is about to be reaped; the vintage of the earth to be gathered. At this time it is, that the complete blessedness of the holy dead commences: when the garner is filled and the chaff cast out. And that not on account of their deliverance from any purgatorial fire, but because of the completion of this number of their brethren, and the full capacities of bliss brought in by the resurrection. Nor can it legitimately be objected to this, that the deaths implied must follow after the proclamation, For no doubt this would be so, the proclamation itself being anticipatory, and the harvest not yet actually come). <b>Yea, saith the Spirit </b>(the utterance of the voice from heaven still continues.

Is it the ingathering of the wicked, or of the saints, or of both together? Each of these has examples in Scripture symbolism, The first, in Jer. li, 33, where it is said of Babylon, “It is time to thresh her, yet a little while and the time of her harvest is come:” and as appears, Joel iii. 15, though the reference seems rather there to be to the vintage: the second, in Matt.ix.39, and parallels; Mark iv. 29; John iv. 35; the third, in Matt. xiii. 30, 39. The verdict of commentators is very much divided. There are circumstances in the context which tell both ways. The parallelism with the vintage, which follows, seems to favour a harvest of the wicked: but then on the other hand, if so, what is the distinction between the two ingatherings? and why do we read of the casting into the winepress of God’s wrath in the second case, and of no corresponding feature in the other? Again, why is the agency so different— the Son of man on the white cloud with the golden crown in the one case, the mere angel in the other? Besides, the two gatherings seem quite distinct. ‘The former is over before the other begins. On the whole then, though I would not pronounce decidedly, I much incline to think that the harvest is the ingathering of the saints, God’s harvest, reaped from the earth: described here thus generally, before the vintage of wrath which follows. And thus we have at least these two visions in harmony with the character of this section, which contains the mingled agency and fortunes of the Church and of its enemies; thus this harvest answers to the great preaching of the everlasting gospel above, vv. 6,7, while the following vintage fulfils the denunciations of wrath on those who worship the image or receive the mark of the beast, vv. 8, 11. And thus too we bring this description into harmony with our Lord’s important parable in Mark iv. 29, where the very words are used of the agency of Christ Himself when the work of grace is ripe, whether in the individual or in the church. But while thus inclined, I will not deny that the other view, and that which unites both, have very much to he said for them).<h2><u><b>17—20</b>.]</u></h2> <i>The vintage of wrath</i><b>.</b> <b>And another angel</b> (<b>another</b> may perhaps refer to the three angels who have already appeared in this vision: or, which is more probable, referring to the last-mentioned Agent, may be a general term, not necessarily implying that He was a mere angel) <b>came out from the temple which was in heaven </b>(from which come forth God’s judgments: see ch. xi. 19), <b>having himself also </b>(as well as that other: but the<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14yxNF5LqKiGnivdgI3ct4KlFZ-Nj72OP/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

The blood coming forth from the treading of the winepress is in accordance with the Old Test. prophecy alluded to, Isa. Ixiii, 3. It is in the depth, and the distance indicated, that the principal difficulty lies. The number of stadii (or furlongs) is supposed by some to be the length of the Holy Land, as given by Jerome at 160 Roman miles. But the great objection to this is, that 160 miles = 1280, not 1600 stadii.

THE SEVEN VIALS And herein, <h2><u>XV. 1—8.]</u></h2> PREFATORY: <i>the description of the vision</i>, ver. 1: <i>the song of triumph of the saints victorious over the beast,</i> vv. 2—4: <i>the coming forth of the seven angels and delivering to them of the seven vials,</i> vv. 5—8.<br><br><b>And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues which are the last [plagues], because in them is com- pleted the wrath of God </b>(I have adopted an unusual arrangement to throw the word <b>because</b> into connexion with <b>the last</b>, for which epithet it renders a reason. It is to be observed 1) that this verse is evidently only a compendious description of the following vision: for the angels themselves are not seen till ver. 6, and do not receive the vials containing the plagues till after they are seen: 2) that the whole of God’s wrath in <i>final judgment </i>is not exhausted by these vials, but only the whole of His wrath in sending plagues on the earth <i>previous to the judgment</i>. After these there are no more plagues: they are concluded with the destruction of Babylon. Then the Lord Himself appears, ch. xix. 11 ff). <b>And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire</b> (see ch. iv. 6 and note: not merely glassy: the as it were indicates the likeness: it was as it were made of glass, The addition <b>mingled with fire </b>is probably made as bringing into the previous celestial imagery an element belonging to this portion of the prophecy, of which <i>judgment</i> is the prevailing complexion: The fact, that the personages of the former heavenly vision are still present, ver. 7, seems to remove all doubt of this being the <i>same sea</i> of glass as that before described ch. iv. 6, in immediate connexion with which the four living-beings were mentioned), <b>and the conquerors of</b> (literally, out of: they have come victorious out of the strife) <b>the beast and of his image and of the number of his name</b> (i.e. of the temptation to wor- ship his image and to receive the mark consisting of the number of his name, ch. xiii, 17, 18), <b>standing on </b>(does this im- port actually “<i>upon</i>,” so that they stood <i>on the surface</i> of the sea, or merely <i>on the shore of</i>?

Many other meanings more or less far-fetched have been given, but where Scripture analogy is so plain, the simplest is the best).<h2><u><b>CH XVI. 1—21</b>.]</u></h2> THE SEVEN VIALS. See the general remarks on ch, viii. 1 for all questions common to the three great series of visions. The following special particulars are here to be noticed: 1) In the description, ch. xvi., which first introduces these plagues, they are plainly called <b>the seven plagues which are the last.</b> There can then be no doubt here, not only that the series reaches on to the time of the end, but that the whole of it is to be placed close to the same time. And this is borne out by the particulars evolved in the course of the visions themselves. For we find that they do not in point of time go back, but at once take up the events of the former visions, and occur during the times of the sounding of the seventh trumpet, when the mystery of God should be finished. 2) As in the seals and in the trumpets, so here again, there is a marked distinction between the first four and the following three. As there, so here, the objects of the first four are the earth, the sea, the springs of waters, and the sun. After this the objects become more particularized : the throne of the beast, the river Euphrates, with the reservation of that peculiar and vague character for the <i>seventh</i>, which seems to belong to it in all the three series, 3) As before, so now, there is a compendious and anticipatory character about several of the vials, leading us to believe that those of which this is not so plain, partake of this character also. For example, under the <i>third</i> vial we find an acknowledgment of the divine justice in making those drink blood who shed the blood of saints and prophets. This, there can be little doubt, points on to the judgment on Babylon, in whom, ch. xviii. 24, was found the blood of saints and prophets, and of all that had been slain on the earth, Again, under the <i>sixth</i> we have the same great gathering to battle which is described in detail, ch. xix.17—21. And finally, under the <i>seventh</i>, we have a compendious anticipatory notice of the judgment of Babylon, hereafter, ch. xvii., xviii. to be described in detail,—and of the great<br><h3><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cySVkfDcpKq7Pgwxyct5labAhqPJerna/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=102686065507783622876&rtpof=true&sd=true

While by the plague of the fourth trumpet, the sun, moon, and stars are partially darkened, by that of the fourth vial the power of the sun is <i>increased</i>, and the darkening of the Kingdom of the beast is reserved for the <i>fifth</i>. ‘The minor special features will be noticed as we proceed, On the whole, the series of the vials seems to bear a less general character than the other two. It takes up a particular point in the prophecy, and deals with symbols and persons previously described. It belongs, by its very conditions, exclusively to the time of, or to days approaching very near to the time of, the end: including in itself the subsequent details as far as the end of ch. xx.: without however noticing most important features and considerable prophetic periods,<h2><u><b>1.</b>]</u></h2> <i>Introductory</i>. <b>And I heard a great voice out of the temple</b><i><b> </b></i>(from the fact, ch. xv. 8, that the divine Presence is fill-ing the temple, and that none might enter into it, this voice can be no other than the diving voice) <b>saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the seven vials of the wrath of God into the earth</b> (so, previous to the series of trumpets, the angel casts the fire from the altar into the earth, ch. viii. 5).<h2><u><b>2.</b>]</u></h2> <b>And the first departed</b> (each angel, as his turn comes, leaves the heavenly scene, and from the space between heaven and earth, empties his vial on the ap- pointed object) <b>and poured out his vial into the earth</b> (the <b>earth</b>, which before in ver. 1 was general, is now particular, and correlative with the objects of the other vials, compare vv. 2, 3, “<i>into the sea,</i>” “<i>into the waters</i>”):<b> and there came </b>(took place: <i>fell</i>, as A.V.) <b>an evil </b>(in itself) <b>and painful </b>(to the sufferers) <b>sore upon the men that had the mark of the beast and that worshipped his image </b>(see above, ch. xiii, 15—17, xiv. 9,10.
